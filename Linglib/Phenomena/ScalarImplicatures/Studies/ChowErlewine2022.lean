# Chow & Erlewine 2022: Restrictions on the Position of *exh*
@cite{chow-erlewine-2022}

Keng Ji Chow & Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine.
Restrictions on the position of *exh*. Proceedings of SALT 32: 522--542.

## Core Contributions

1. Additive particles (*also*, *again*) diagnose the structural position of
   *exh*: the presupposition of *also* is sensitive to whether *exh* is in
   its scope.

2. **"As low as possible" generalization** (9): for certain SI triggers
   (disjunction, bare numerals, unstressed *some*, conjunction, *all*),
   *exh* must adjoin to the lowest position where it is not vacuous.

3. **Three-way lexical classification** of SI triggers by `[uexh]` feature
   (§3.3, (30)), following @cite{chierchia-2013}'s feature-checking approach:
   - `[uexh*]` (strong): *or*, bare numerals, *sm*, *and*, *all*
   - `[uexh]` (weak): stressed *SOME*
   - `[—]` (none): scalar adjectives

4. **Ignorance implicatures in embedded positions** (§4): the covert □ that
   derives ignorance can occur below the clause edge, contra
   Meyer's "Matrix K" theory.

## Formalization Strategy

Adjunction sites are derived from tree structure via `OpTree.inScopeOf`,
not stipulated as an enum. The tree determines whether *exh* must be below
a presupposition trigger (like *also*), and @cite{fox-2007}'s computable
`exhB` verifies the resulting semantic predictions on finite models.

/-- A tree for reasoning about operator scope and adjunction.

is at the leaves. Labels are theory-neutral strings — no syntactic framework
is assumed. The tree structure alone determines scope relations. -/

-- ============================================================================

/-- Syntactic feature governing *exh* placement (@cite{chow-erlewine-2022} §3.3).

SI triggers bear one of three features constraining where their associated
*exh* may adjoin. This is orthogonal to `SITrigger` (which governs *when*
SIs fire); `ExhFeature` governs *where exh adjoins*.

- `strong` `[uexh*]`: *exh* as low as possible (non-vacuously)
- `weak` `[uexh]`: *exh* within local finite clause or just above embedding verb
- `none` `[—]`: no constraint on *exh* position -/
inductive ExhFeature where
  | strong  -- [uexh*]: or, bare numerals, unstressed some, and, all
  | weak    -- [uexh]: stressed SOME
  | none    -- [—]: scalar adjectives

Three candidate parses for (32) `[Nina]_F also teaches A or B` with
ignorance inferences. The inner *exh* (exh1) must check `[uexh*]`.
The outer *exh* (exh2) applies above □ to derive ignorance.
