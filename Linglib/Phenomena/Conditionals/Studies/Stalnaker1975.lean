*Indicative Conditionals.* Philosophia 5(3): 269–286.

## Core contributions formalized here

1. **The pragmatic constraint on selection** (§III): if `i ∈ C`, then
   `f(A,i) ∈ C` whenever some `A`-world is in `C`.

2. **Indicative ≠ subjunctive at the pragmatic level** (§III/IV): both have
   the same truth-conditional clause; subjunctive mood signals that the
   pragmatic constraint may be suspended.

3. **Disjunction-appropriateness** (§III): `A or B` is appropriately
   asserted only in contexts where both `¬A∧B` and `A∧¬B` are open.

4. **The direct argument is a reasonable inference but not an entailment**
   (§IV): from `A or B`, infer `if ¬A, B`.
   * `direct_argument_reasonable`: in any context where the disjunction
     can be appropriately asserted, the post-update context makes the
     indicative conditional true at every surviving world.
   * `direct_argument_not_entailment`: a single concrete world model
     exhibits a selection function for which `A∨B` holds at a world but
     `if ¬A, B` fails — so the inference is not semantic entailment.

5. **Fatalism failure** (§V): sketched in `fatalism_remark` as a docstring;
   the formal point is that constructive dilemma is valid only for
   entailments, not for reasonable inferences.

The two universal pragmatic postulates from the Appendix
(`respectsCompatibility`, `changeFn_eq`) are stated in
`Theories/Pragmatics/Assertion/ReasonableInference.lean`.

## Integration

* `pragmaticConstraint`, `selectionConditional`, `moodedConditional`,
  `Mood.admissibleSelection`, `selectionConditional_eq_material_within_context`,
  `moodedConditional_indicative_eq_material_within_context` —
  in `Theories/Semantics/Conditionals/Basic.lean`. The mood distinction lives
  in `Mood.admissibleSelection`, not in two parallel conditional defs:
  `.indicative` requires `pragmaticConstraint`, `.subjunctive` imposes none.
* `Appropriateness`, `changeFn`, `reasonableInference` — in
  `Theories/Pragmatics/Assertion/ReasonableInference.lean`.
* This file: a butler/gardener witness for (4); abstract version of (4)
  parameterised over any constraint-respecting selection function.

## See also

* `Phenomena/Modality/Studies/CarianiSantorio2018.lean` — extends the
  Stalnaker selection-function mechanism from conditionals to bare
  *will*. C&S's `Core.SelectionFunction` infrastructure is exactly the
  one used here for `selectionConditional`; the `would`-conditional /
  Stalnaker-counterfactual identification in C&S §5.3.2 reuses this
  paper's selection-function semantics under universe parameter.

-- § 1. The direct argument is REASONABLE (abstract version)

/--
**Stalnaker's direct argument is reasonable** (@cite{stalnaker-1975} §IV).

Quantified over any selection function `s` and context `C` such that:
- `s` obeys the pragmatic constraint relative to `C`;
- the antecedent `¬A` is open in `C` (some context-set world is `¬A`);
- in `C`, every world satisfies `A ∨ B` (i.e., the disjunction is
  established as common ground after assertion);

the indicative conditional `if ¬A, B` is true at every world in `C`.

This is the substance of §IV: no individual semantic entailment is invoked;
the pragmatic constraint plus the post-update common ground are enough.

Stalnaker's appropriateness condition for disjunction (§III, end) — that
asserting `A or B` requires both `¬A∧B` and `A∧¬B` to be open in the prior
context — is what guarantees `h_open_notA` after the update. -/

**The direct argument is reasonable as a `reasonableInference`**
(@cite{stalnaker-1975} Appendix), in the sense of the change-function
calculus: in every prior context `k` such that asserting `A∨B` lands one
in a Stalnakerian indicative-friendly state, the post-update context
entails the indicative conditional.

The Appropriateness relation here bundles the two contextual facts the
disjunction-appropriateness condition guarantees: the pragmatic constraint
holds, and `¬A` remains open after the update. -/

this selection function. -/

-- § 3. Note on contraposition, hypothetical syllogism, and fatalism

/-! ### Contraposition / hypothetical syllogism

@cite{stalnaker-1975} observes that contraposition and hypothetical
syllogism fail in general for selection-based conditionals; the
counterexamples all involve **subjunctives** whose antecedents are
presupposed false. For indicatives — which obey `pragmaticConstraint` —
both inference forms come out reasonable in the Appendix's sense.

The semantic-failure side already exists as
`Semantics.Conditionals.perfection_not_entailed_variablyStrict` and can be
adapted directly to selection-based conditionals. The pragmatic-success
side is a clean extension of `direct_argument_reasonable` and is left for
follow-up. -/

/-! ### Fatalism (§V) `fatalism_remark`

Dummett's wartime-Britain fatalism argument has the form:
1. `K ∨ ¬K` (premise: I will be killed or not).
2. From `K`, derive `If P, K` (precautions ineffective).
3. From `¬K`, derive `If ¬P, ¬K` (precautions unnecessary).
4. ∴ `Q ∨ R`.

Steps 2 and 3 are *reasonable inferences* (they exploit the post-update
context where `K` or `¬K` is taken as established). Step 4 applies
constructive dilemma — valid for **entailments**, but not for
reasonable inferences. The argument equivocates the two notions.

Formalising this requires the n-ary `appropriateSeq` machinery already
present, plus a counterexample showing constructive dilemma fails for
reasonable inference. Left for follow-up. -/
