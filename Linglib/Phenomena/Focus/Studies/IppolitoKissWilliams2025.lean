# @cite{ippolito-kiss-williams-2025}: Discourse *only*
@cite{ippolito-kiss-williams-2022} @cite{potts-2005} @cite{roberts-2012} @cite{thomas-2026} @cite{merin-1999}

Formalisation of @cite{ippolito-kiss-williams-2025} "Discourse only"
(WCCFL 41 proceedings, pp. 222–231). Discourse *only* is a clausal
connective taking two clausal arguments `S` and `S'` and contributing
a conventional implicature (CI) of *lack of agreement* between `S` and
`S'` w.r.t. a QUD.

The doxastic-evidential apparatus (`Supports`, `Agree`, `Disagree`)
that the paper's §4 statement uses is attributed by the paper itself
to the predecessor @cite{ippolito-kiss-williams-2022} ("Following
Ippolito et al. (2022) we define…"); it lives in
`Phenomena/Focus/Studies/IppolitoKissWilliams2022.lean` and is imported
here. This file owns the paper-specific bundling — `Sentence`,
`Context`, the felicity conditions of ex. (16), the architectural
derivations of §5.2, the worked house-buying example of §7, and a
project-internal bridge to @cite{merin-1999}'s DTS for the §6
*only*-vs-*but* discussion.

## The puzzle

Cross-linguistically, some languages have a discourse particle glossed
as "only" that conjoins two clauses while signalling that the second
undermines the evidential trajectory of the first. Paper (29a-d) all
use a single house-buying frame:

- Italian   *solo che*  ("La casa è bella, solo che è costosissima")
- Russian   *tol'ko*    ("Dom krasivyj, tol'ko ochen' dorogoj")
- Hungarian *csak*      ("Szép a ház, csak nagyon drága")
- Mandarin  *zhǐshì*    ("Zhège fángzi hěn piàoliang, zhǐshì yǒudiǎr guì")

## Paper ex. (16) — the proposal

`⟦S [only S']⟧^c` is defined only if `S` and `S'` are relevant to the
QUD in `c` and `∃ α ∈ QUD, S` supports `α`. If defined:

* **At-issue**: highlighted content of `S` intersected with that of `S'`
  — every world where both are informatively true.
* **CI**: `∃ α ∈ QUD` such that
  (i)  every true partial answer `p ∉ QUD` is positive evidence for `α`;
  (ii) `S'` does not support `α`.

The Lean `ciContent` (i) restricts to partial answers `p ∉ alt qud`
to match the paper's `p ∉ QUD` exclusion; the "p supports α" gloss is
implemented as `IsPositiveEvidence p α` rather than fully-doxastic
`Supports`, since established partial answers are presumed already
common-ground. A doxastic-gated variant is straightforward but
deferred.

## Architectural derivations

* **Interrogative left-arg restriction** (§5.2). Canonical info-seeking
  questions cannot be the left argument because the speaker doesn't
  believe any answer, so `dox ⊆ q` fails for all `q ∈ alt S`, so
  `Supports` fails. This falls out from `Supports.of_no_belief_fails`
  in `IppolitoKissWilliams2022.lean` — no clause-type filter required.
* **Biased / rhetorical questions can be left-args** (§5.2 ex. (20)–(21)).
  These have a believed answer (`dox ⊆ q` for some `q`), so the doxastic
  condition is satisfied.

## Layout

* **Substrate** (`Sentence`, `Context`, `isDefined`, `ciContent`,
  `agree`, `disagree`) and architectural theorems
  (`interrogative_blocks_support`, `weak_non_agreement`,
  `disagree_imp_ciContent_of_empty_partials`).
* **Part I**: end-to-end derivation chains for the house-buying
  scenario (§7), instantiating the substrate on a concrete 8-world
  model and connecting the predictions to the cross-linguistic data
  in the sibling `Data.lean`.
* **Part II** *(project-internal bridge, not paper-engagement)*: a
  Bayesian-to-DTS connection. @cite{merin-1999} is **not** cited in
  the paper's reference list; this section is the formaliser's overlay
  relating linglib's Merin-DTS apparatus to discourse *only*'s CI when
  the binary-QUD configuration *also* meets the stronger *but*
  condition of negative relevance. The asymmetry with *but* asserted
  in the paper's §6 is **not** "every *but* context licenses *only*"
  (the paper's (27)/(28) data show otherwise) and no theorem to that
  effect is asserted here.

`sDen` is the inquisitive denotation of the left argument `S`,

denotation type is uniform — what varies between declarative and
interrogative arguments is whether `Supports` can be satisfied. -/

         evidence for `α`;
    (ii) `S` itself supports `α`;
    (iii) `S'` does **not** support `α`.

    The `p ∉ alt ctx.qud` exclusion in (i) matches the paper's
    `p ∉ QUD` restriction. The "p supports α" gloss is read here as
    raw `IsPositiveEvidence` (presuming established partial answers are
    common-ground); a doxastic-gated variant using the IKW 2022
    `Supports` predicate is straightforward but not currently used.

    When `partialAnswers` is empty, condition (i) is vacuously true:
    no prior evidence contradicts the direction. -/

/-- @cite{ippolito-kiss-williams-2025} §5.2: an info-seeking
    interrogative cannot be the left argument because the speaker
    doesn't believe any of its alternatives, so `Supports` fails for

/-- @cite{ippolito-kiss-williams-2025} §5.2: an info-seeking

/-- Weak non-agreement (@cite{ippolito-kiss-williams-2025} §5.2 prose
    around ex. (18)): when `S'` cannot support any QUD answer, `S` and
    `S'` neither agree nor disagree. Both relations require `S'` to
    support *something*.

    Example IKW ex. (18): "The house is beautiful, only can we afford
    it?" — `S` supports "buy the house", `S'` supports nothing. Not
    agreement, not disagreement: weak non-agreement. -/

  · rintro ⟨_, ⟨α, hMem, hS'α⟩, _⟩
    exact hS' α hMem hS'α

/-- @cite{ippolito-kiss-williams-2025} core insight: when `S` and `S'`
    evidentially clash (`disagree`) and there are no prior partial
    answers, the CI is automatically satisfied.

    Proof: pick the witness `α` from `S`'s support side; by ¬agree,
    `S'` cannot support that same `α`; the empty-partial-answers
    hypothesis discharges (i) vacuously. -/

The five sorries discharged in §6 and §7 establish the §7 cross-linguistic
predictions on a concrete 8-world model with uniform prior. The PMF
arithmetic reduces to four base probabilities (`beautiful`, `expensive`,
their intersections with `buy`/`buyᶜ`) computed via
`PMF.probOfSet_apply` + `Fin.sum_univ_eight`. The doxastic `⊆` checks
and the `moveRelevant` reductions (via `moveRelevant_polar_iff`) are
pure Set arithmetic discharged by `decide`.

/-! ### § 8: Abstract theorem — interrogative S' trivially satisfies CI

For any context where S supports some QUD answer and S' is an
interrogative whose answer the speaker doesn't know, the CI's
condition (ii) is satisfied: S' trivially fails to support any answer
because `Supports` requires the doxastic condition (`dox ⊆ q`),
which fails when the speaker doesn't believe any alternative of S'.

This generalises the polar-Q derivation to all interrogative S'
examples (30a-d, 31a-d, 32a-d): the specific question content
doesn't matter for the CI — only that the speaker doesn't know the
answer. -/

/-! ## Part II: project-internal Bayesian-to-DTS bridge

@cite{merin-1999}'s Decision-Theoretic Semantics is **not** cited in
@cite{ippolito-kiss-williams-2025}'s reference list. The §6 *but*/*only*
discussion in the paper grounds itself in @cite{anscombre-ducrot-1977}
and the IKW 2022 SuB 26 *but* analysis, not in DTS. The connection
formalized in this section is therefore the formaliser's overlay,
relating linglib's pre-existing Merin-DTS apparatus
(`Theories/Pragmatics/DecisionTheoretic/`) to discourse *only*'s CI
under one specific configuration: a binary QUD where the right argument
*also* meets the stronger Merin negative-relevance condition.

### What is and is not claimed

* `probSupports_implies_posRelevant_binary` and
  `negRelevant_implies_not_probSupports` are Bayesian facts about the
  binary-QUD setting that make the bridge well-defined.
* `discOnly_implies_unexpectedness_under_but` derives Merin
  unexpectedness *for those discourse-only contexts that happen to
  meet the stronger negative-relevance condition*.
* No theorem claims that *every* *but* context licenses discourse
  *only* — the paper's (27)/(28) data show the opposite (contexts
  exist where *but* is felicitous and discourse *only* is `#`).

Bundles a DTS context together with two clausal arguments `s` and
`s'` (as `Set W`) and the evidence that `s` is positively relevant to
the topic H. Unlike the *but* witness, this does NOT require `s'` to
be negatively relevant — discourse *only* only requires `s'` to fail
to support, which is strictly weaker than negative relevance. -/

    the normalization `P(H) + P(¬H) = 1` (`probSum_compl` + `hNorm`).
    Edge case `P(E ∩ ¬H) = 0` is handled separately: the if-branches in
    `bayesFactor`'s definition return `1000` when `P(E|¬H) = 0` and
    `P(E|H) > 0`, both established from the partition. -/

    `P(H|S') ≤ P(H)`. This is the formal content of IKW's observation
    that *but*'s condition on the second clause is strictly stronger
    than discourse *only*'s.

/-- Discourse *only*'s CI implies unexpectedness when the QUD is
    binary, S' is negatively relevant, and CIP holds.

    When S is `posRelevant` and S' is `negRelevant` (the stronger *but*
    condition), Merin's Theorem 8 gives `P(S'|S) < P(S')`: S' is
    unexpected given S.

    Note: this theorem uses the stronger *but* condition
    (`negRelevant`) rather than the weaker discourse *only* condition
    (`¬probSupports`). Unexpectedness in Merin's sense requires active
    counter-relevance, not just failure to support. So unexpectedness
    is a consequence when discourse *only* sentences happen to meet
    the stronger *but* threshold. -/
