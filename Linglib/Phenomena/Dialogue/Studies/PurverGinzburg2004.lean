# Purver & Ginzburg (2004): Clarifying Noun Phrase Semantics
@cite{purver-ginzburg-2004}

@cite{purver-ginzburg-2004} use **fragment-reprise** clarification data to
constrain admissible NP denotations. The empirical lever is the Reprise
Content Hypothesis (RCH): a fragment reprise question must query the
standard semantic content of the fragment being reprised. Anything a theory
says about NP denotation has to survive this test.

## The empirical contrast

> A: *Jo arrived yesterday.*  B: *Jo?*
> A: *A thief broke in last night.*  B: *A thief?*

Both responses are reprise fragments. The first naturally queries identity
("who is Jo?"); the second cannot — it queries the *property* ("someone you
believe to be a thief?") rather than identity ("which specific thief?"). The
asymmetry tracks the referential / non-referential distinction on the host
NP, not its surface form.

## The argument against generalized-quantifier denotations

Standard generalized-quantifier theory assigns *a thief* the denotation
`λP. ∃x. thief(x) ∧ P(x)` of type `(e → t) → t`. A reprise of this fragment,
if it queried the standard semantic content, would query at this *functional*
type — but no observed reprise ever does. The empirical record only shows
queries at individual or property type.

@cite{purver-ginzburg-2004} resolve this by splitting the sign's contextual
parameters into two fields:

- **dgb-params**: referential entities, anchored against context
- **q-params**: existentially-bound indices, closed at proposition level

Both have the same record-type shape — record entries with `INDEX` and
`RESTR(ICTION)`. The split lives at the sign level: 'Jo' contributes a
dgb-params entry; 'a thief' contributes a q-params entry. Reprises operate
on the q-params record, not on a higher-order GQ denotation. RCH then
*does* hold under this revised account.

## What this file proves

Two theorems about RCH (defined in
`Theories/Pragmatics/Dialogue/KOS/RepriseContent.lean`):

1. `gq_reprise_type_mismatch`: a predictor that licenses only `.functional`
   queries — the GQ prediction — fails Weak RCH against any reprise event
   whose observed content includes `.individual` or `.property` queries.

2. `qparams_split_satisfies_weakRCH`: the predictor derived from the
   q-params/dgb-params split (`qParamsPredictor`) satisfies Weak RCH by
   construction.

Both theorems take a `RepriseEvent` carrying a host LocProp; the LocProp's
new `qcparams` field (added in `KOS/Basic.lean`) is what makes the q-params
record visible at the reprise interface.

queries only at *functional* type. The two sets are disjoint, so even Weak
RCH (observed ⊆ predicted) fails.
