# Question — core type, lattice, Heyting derivatives
[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] [ciardelli-2022] [puncochar-2016]
[puncochar-2019] [theiler-etal-2018]

A bundled `Question W` — a non-empty downward-closed family of information
states over `W` (where an information state is a subset of `W`). This is
mathematically a non-empty `LowerSet (Set W)`; in linguistic terms it is
the umbrella structure for question-flavored content: it subsumes
Hamblin alternative sets (`polar`, `which`), partition-style questions
(via `Semantics/Questions/Partition/Basic.lean`), and the inquisitive
propositions of [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]. The name
"Question" follows the decision-theoretic / discourse-semantic tradition
(van Rooij, Westera) — neutral as to whether the consumer is doing
inquisitive theorizing.

This `Basic` file carries the structural core: the type definition with
its `SetLike` instance, the `info`/`alt`/`isInformative`/`isInquisitive`/
`isDeclarative` predicates, the `declarative` constructor, the algebraic
operations (`conj`, `inqDisj`, `top`, `bot`) packaged into the
`CompleteDistribLattice` instance, the basic `info`-on-lattice-operations
API, the `alt`-as-maximal characterization, the existence of alternatives
under finiteness, the **Resolutions Theorem** (DNF), the
**principal-ideal characterization** of declaratives, the Heyting
derivatives (`compl_eq`, `proj`, `nonInfo`, the division law), and the
LEM-fails witness.

For Hamblin constructions (`polar`, `which`), see
`Semantics/Questions/Hamblin.lean`. For answerhood predicates, see
`Semantics/Questions/Resolution.lean`; for question entailment,
`Semantics/Questions/Entailment.lean`. For the `Setoid → Question`
embedding (used by `State`), see
`Semantics/Questions/Partition/Basic.lean`.

## Mathlib alignment

- `props : Set (Set W)` — sets of subsets of `W`, mathlib-native
- `contains_empty` is logically equivalent to `Nonempty props` together
  with downward closure — we expose it as the field directly because
  it's the only constraint that matters once downward closure holds
- `info` returns `Set W` (mathlib-native), not `W → Bool`
- `SetLike (Question W) (Set W)` — auto-derives `Membership`,
  `CoeSort`, and the `ext` machinery. `mem_props` is the canonical
  simp normalization (`q ∈ P.props → q ∈ P`).
- `CompleteDistribLattice (Question W)` — registered via
  `CompleteDistribLattice.ofMinimalAxioms` from two pointwise
  inequalities, giving `Frame`, `Coframe`, `HeytingAlgebra`, and
  `BiheytingAlgebra` for free. Mirrors `Filter`'s registration pattern.

### Why a bundled structure rather than `LowerSet (Set W)`?

A downward-closed family of propositions on `W` is, abstractly, a
`LowerSet (Set W)`. We considered registering `Question`
as a `LowerSet` synonym, but rejected it because the `⊥` elements
disagree: `LowerSet.⊥ = ∅` (no resolving propositions), while ours is
`{∅}` (only the inconsistent state resolves). The non-emptiness
constraint (`contains_empty`) is essential to inquisitive semantics
and is lost in `LowerSet`. We use `SetLike` instead, which gives the
membership/coercion API without forcing `LowerSet`'s `⊥`.

universe u

/-- An inquisitive proposition in the sense of
    [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]: a non-empty
    downward-closed family of information states over `W`. The states in
    `props` are the ones that *resolve* the issue raised by the sentence. -/
structure Question (W : Type u) where
  /-- The set of propositions resolving the issue. -/
  props : Set (Set W)
  /-- Contains the empty proposition (= the inconsistent information
      state). Equivalent to non-emptiness given downward closure. -/
  contains_empty : ∅ ∈ props
  /-- Downward closed: if `p` resolves the issue and `q ⊆ p`, then `q`
      also resolves it (any sufficient evidence is also sufficient when
      strengthened). -/
  downward_closed : ∀ p ∈ props, ∀ q : Set W, q ⊆ p → q ∈ props

namespace Question

variable {W : Type u}

/-- `SetLike` instance: an `Question W` coerces to its underlying
    `Set (Set W)` of resolving propositions. Auto-derives `Membership`
    (`q ∈ P` means `q ∈ P.props`), `CoeSort`, and the standard `ext`
    machinery. Mirrors mathlib's pattern for `Submonoid`, `Subgroup`,
    `LowerSet`, etc. -/

    `props` covers all of `info P`). -/
def isInquisitive (P : Question W) : Prop :=
  info P ∉ P.props

/-- A sentence is **declarative** iff it is not inquisitive —
    equivalently, iff `info P ∈ props`. Algebraic characterization

    obligations in mathlib's `IsLowerSet` vocabulary, so a caller holding

/-! ### Algebraic operations ([puncochar-2019] §2)

Following the support-clause definitions in [puncochar-2019] §2:
conjunction is `||α ∧ β|| = ||α|| ∩ ||β||` (state supports `α ∧ β` iff
it supports both); inquisitive disjunction is `||α ⩒ β|| = ||α|| ∪ ||β||`
(state supports `α ⩒ β` iff it supports either).

Implication `→` and negation `¬` arise as the Heyting `⇨` and `ᶜ` of
the `CompleteDistribLattice` structure registered below; see the
"Heyting derivatives" section for the structural identity
`Pᶜ = declarative (info P)ᶜ` and the derivatives it grounds. -/

/-- **Inquisitive conjunction** `P ∧ Q` ([puncochar-2019] §2 ∧
    clause): `props` is the pointwise intersection. A state resolves
    `P ∧ Q` iff it resolves both `P` and `Q`. -/
def conj (P Q : Question W) : Question W where
  props := P.props ∩ Q.props
  contains_empty := ⟨P.contains_empty, Q.contains_empty⟩
  downward_closed := fun p hp q hq =>
    ⟨P.downward_closed p hp.1 q hq, Q.downward_closed p hp.2 q hq⟩

/-- **Inquisitive disjunction** `P ⩒ Q` ([puncochar-2019] §2 ⩒
    clause): `props` is the pointwise union. A state resolves
    `P ⩒ Q` iff it resolves `P` or `Q`. Distinct from classical
    disjunction `∨`, whose support clause involves splitting the state
    across two substates. -/

    issue. The trivial inquiry that demands nothing. -/
def top : Question W where
  props := Set.univ
  contains_empty := Set.mem_univ _
  downward_closed := fun _ _ _ _ => Set.mem_univ _

/-- The **bottom** inquisitive content: only the inconsistent state
    (`∅`) resolves the issue. The unsatisfiable inquiry. -/

    rw [Set.mem_singleton_iff] at hp
    rw [hp] at hq
    rw [Set.mem_singleton_iff]
    exact Set.subset_empty_iff.mp hq

/-! ### Complete lattice structure

We package the algebraic operations into mathlib's order/lattice
typeclasses: the entailment order `P ≤ Q := P.props ⊆ Q.props` makes
`Question W` into a **bounded distributive complete lattice**
with `⊓ = conj`, `⊔ = inqDisj`, `⊥ = bot`, `⊤ = top`, plus arbitrary
suprema and infima.

`sSup S` is the union of all `props` fields (with `∅` adjoined so
`contains_empty` holds vacuously when `S = ∅`); `sInf S` is the
intersection (`= univ`, vacuously, when `S = ∅`, which gives `⊤`).
This gives access to the entire mathlib order/lattice API
(`inf_le_left`, `le_sup_right`, `inf_sup_right`, `iSup`, `iInf`,
`sSup_le_iff`, intervals, lattice homomorphisms, …).

Distributivity (binary) is free: it reduces to the standard set
distributivity on the underlying `Set (Set W)`, and falls out of the
`CompleteDistribLattice` registration below (no separate
`DistribLattice` instance needed). -/

/-- The arbitrary supremum: a state resolves `sSup S` iff it resolves
    some `P ∈ S` (or is the empty state, which always resolves). -/
def sSupContent (S : Set (Question W)) : Question W where

/-! ### Distributivity

`Question W` is a complete distributive lattice (in mathlib's
sense: both a `Frame` and a `Coframe`). This subsumes finite
distributivity, gives a `HeytingAlgebra` (and `BiheytingAlgebra`)
structure for free, and follows from a single fact about the underlying
`Set (Set W)`: pointwise `∩` distributes over arbitrary `∪`, and
pointwise `∪` distributes over arbitrary `∩`.

We register it via `CompleteDistribLattice.ofMinimalAxioms`, which
needs only the two inequalities `inf_sSup ≤ iSup_inf` and
`iInf_sup ≤ sup_sInf`. -/

/-! ### Basic API for `info` on the lattice operations

`info` is a monotone map from `(Question W, ≤)` to
`(Set W, ⊆)` and commutes with `⊔` (and `⊥`/`⊤`). The story for `⊓`
is one-sided: `info` distributes over union but only sub-distributes
over intersection (the same asymmetry as `⋃₀` over `Set` operations). -/

/-- `info` is monotone in the entailment order: a stronger inquiry has
    no more informative content than a weaker one. -/

/-! ### `alt` API and inquisitivity from alternatives

The `alt` (alternatives) selector picks out maximal propositions in
`P.props`. Two basic facts: alternatives are propositions, and the
union of alternatives is contained in `info P` (equality requires
finite-`W` or other guarantees that maximals exist —
[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] discusses the limit case
where no maximal element exists). The two-alternatives criterion
gives a sufficient condition for inquisitivity that does not depend
on finiteness. -/

/-- Unfolded membership in `alt`. *Not* the simp normal form —
    `mem_alt_iff_maximal` is preferred because it connects to mathlib's
    `Maximal` API. Use this lemma when destructuring is more convenient
    than going through `Maximal`. -/

/-! ### Existence of alternatives under finiteness

When `W` is finite, `P.props ⊆ Set W` is finite, so every
proposition extends to a maximal one. This gives the dual half of
`sUnion_alt_subset_info`: `info P ⊆ ⋃₀ alt P`, hence equality.

Without finiteness, alternatives need not exist — a downward-closed
family with no maximal element (e.g. `{q ⊊ Set.univ | q.Finite}`
on infinite `W`) is a valid `Question` with `alt P = ∅`
even though `info P ≠ ∅`. -/

/-- **Existence of alternatives** under finiteness: every proposition
    in `P.props` extends to a maximal one (i.e., to an alternative).

    Hypothesis is the *minimal* one: `P.props.Finite` (not `Finite W`).
    The latter implies the former (since `Set.instFinite` gives
    `Finite (Set W)` and `P.props ⊆ Set W`), but `P.props.Finite` can
    hold even on infinite worlds (e.g., a content with finitely many
    alternatives over an infinite world space). -/

/-! ### The Resolutions Theorem (DNF for inquisitive content)

The deepest theorem about `Question`: under finiteness, every
inquisitive content equals the inquisitive disjunction of the
declaratives generated by its alternatives. This is the
inquisitive-semantics analogue of disjunctive normal form, justifying
the slogan "an inquisitive content is its alternatives" — once
alternatives exist (finiteness), they fully determine the content.

This subsumes:
- Single-alternative case: `P = declarative p` iff `alt P = {p}`
  (the principal-ideal characterization for declaratives).
- The polar case: `polar p = declarative p ⊔ declarative pᶜ` (in
  `Hamblin.lean`) is literally `⨆ q ∈ {p, pᶜ}, declarative q`.
- Setoid-derived inquiries: `fromSetoid r` resolves to the iSup over
  equivalence classes (each class is an alternative).

Without finiteness the theorem fails (alternatives may not exist),
but the **inequality** `⨆ p ∈ alt P, declarative p ≤ P` holds always. -/

/-- The lower bound (always holds): the inquisitive disjunction of the
    declarative principal ideals of `P`'s alternatives is contained in
    `P` itself. -/

/-- **Resolutions Theorem under "alternatives-cover" hypothesis**: when
    every resolving proposition extends to an alternative, `P` equals the
    inquisitive disjunction of the declaratives generated by its
    alternatives. The hypothesis `hExt` is **strictly weaker** than
    `P.props.Finite`: atoms have `props = {q | q ⊆ V}` (potentially
    infinite if `V` infinite) but `alt = {V}`, so `hExt` discharges by
    `q ⊆ V → q ⊆ V` while finiteness fails.

    This is **Booth 2022's Compactness of Alternatives** for atomic and
    decomposable bilateral inquisitive propositions, captured at the
    `Question` substrate level. -/

[puncochar-2019]: declarative propositions are, algebraically
speaking, principal ideals in the algebra of information states. We

principal ideal generated by `info P`. We also prove the equivalent
characterization via alternatives: `P` is declarative iff
`alt P = {info P}`. -/

/-! ### Heyting derivatives: complement, projection, division law

The `CompleteDistribLattice` structure registered above gives us a
`HeytingAlgebra` for free, so `Pᶜ` (pseudo-complement) and `P ⇨ Q`
(Heyting implication) come pre-installed with their universal
properties. The structural fact that drives the inquisitive-specific
theory is the explicit formula for `Pᶜ`:

    `Pᶜ = declarative (info P)ᶜ`

i.e., complementing `P` is the same as complementing its informative
content and taking the principal ideal. This single identity
(`compl_eq`) lets us derive the standard inquisitive operators
([ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]; [puncochar-2019]):

- the **non-inquisitive projection** `!P = Pᶜᶜ = declarative (info P)`
  (`proj_eq_compl_compl`),
- the **non-informative projection** `?P = P ⊔ Pᶜ`,
- and the **division law** `!P ⊓ ?P = P` decomposing every content into
  its informative and inquisitive components (`proj_inf_nonInfo`).

The lattice is **Heyting but not Boolean**: LEM `P ⊔ Pᶜ = ⊤` fails in
general — see `not_lem_inquisitive_content` below. -/

A central feature of inquisitive semantics is that the standard logical
laws of a Boolean algebra do not all hold. In particular, the law of
excluded middle `P ⊔ Pᶜ = ⊤` fails: an inquisitive content `P` and its
pseudo-complement `Pᶜ` are both *declarative*, so their join is
declarative too, while `⊤` is the trivially-resolved content (every
state in `props`). The witness below uses the polar-question shape
`declarative {true} ⊔ declarative {true}ᶜ` over `Bool`. -/

(`declarativeEmbedding`) and preserves meets and `⊤`
(`declarativeHom : InfTopHom`), but **not** joins: the join of two
declaratives can be genuinely inquisitive
(`exists_isInquisitive_declarative_sup`) — inquisitive content enters
the algebra exactly at `⊔`. The classical context-set picture of
`Discourse/CommonGround.lean` (its scoped meet monoid and

supports / resolves the issue `P` iff `s` is one of the resolving propositions
(`s ∈ P.props`). This is the inquisitive notion of support
([ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]). -/

/-- Inquisitive support: `s ⊨ P` iff the state `s` resolves the issue `P`. -/
instance instSupport : Question.Support (Set W) (Question W) where
  supports s P := s ∈ P

theorem supports_iff (s : Set W) (P : Question W) :
    Question.Support.supports s P ↔ s ∈ P := Iff.rfl

end Question
