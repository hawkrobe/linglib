# Answerhood operators on Hamblin sets

A Hamblin set `H : Set (Set W)` is a set of propositions. The theories that
take a question to denote such a set locate "the answer at world `w`" by an
operator on the members of `H` true at `w`:

- `trueAnswers H w`, the [karttunen-1977] set of true members;
- `weakAnswer H w`, their intersection, the weakly exhaustive answer of
  [heim-1994] (Ans₁) and [beck-rullmann-1999];
- `strongAnswer H w`, the worlds deciding every member as `w` does, the
  strongly exhaustive answer of [groenendijk-stokhof-1984] and Heim's Ans₂;
- `partition H`, the Groenendijk–Stokhof partition as a `Setoid`, the kernel of
  `trueAnswers H`: its cells are the strong answers (`strongAnswer_eq_cell`), and as an
  inquisitive question it is the meet of the members' polar questions
  (`fromSetoid_partition`);
- `IsStrongestTrueAnswer H w p`, [dayal-1996]'s maximally informative true
  member: the least true member under entailment, `IsLeast`. Its existence is
  Dayal's existential presupposition `IsExhaustivelyResolvable`; `dayalAns`
  returns it and `dayalStrongAns` applies Heim's strengthening to it;
- `IsExhaustivelyResolvableOn H s`, the presupposition on an information
  state: a least member the state supports, Dayal's at the singleton `{w}`;
- `isExhaustivelyResolvable_range_iff`, the presupposition on a topical
  property `P : α → Set W` from short answers to propositions ([xiang-2022]),
  whose Hamblin set is `Set.range P`: a true short answer entailing every
  true one;
- `box H R`, the question under necessity, the image of `H` under
  `SetRel.core R`, whose presupposition at a world is the prejacent's on
  that world's modal base (`isExhaustivelyResolvable_box_iff`);
- `KnowsAnswer H w R x`, an agent's knowledge of the answer through their
  doxastic alternatives, and `PossiblyIgnorant H c R x`, [dayal-2025]'s
  requirement on the perspectival center of a question;
- `exhCell H p`, [fox-2018]'s cells;
- `ofFinset F`, a finite family of finite propositions, on which the
  presuppositions are decidable.

The presupposition holds exactly when the weak answer is itself a member
(`isExhaustivelyResolvable_iff`), so Dayal's operator agrees with Heim's and
Beck and Rullmann's wherever it is defined, and its strong form agrees with
the Groenendijk–Stokhof answer (`dayalStrongAns_eq_some_iff`). An inquisitive
question `Q : Question W` enters through its alternatives `alt Q`, an
antichain, over which the least true member is the only true member
(`isStrongestTrueAnswer_iff_of_antichain`): the number-sensitive answerhood
of [dayal-2016] needs Hamblin sets whose members entail one another, which
`alt` discards.
