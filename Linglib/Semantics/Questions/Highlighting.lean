# Highlighting

Besides the proposition it expresses, a sentence highlights some possibilities, making them
salient as antecedents for anaphora such as polarity particles, and each highlighted possibility
is negative when the sentence introducing it is negative. Roelofsen and Farkas compute the
highlights of a formula compositionally beside its inquisitive proposition, so that `?p` and
`?¬p` express the same issue but highlight `p` positively and its complement negatively. This
file develops basic results about highlighting, including that every formula expresses the
proposition of the InqB formula it abbreviates, while its highlights are a function neither of
that proposition nor of that InqB formula.

## Main definitions

* `Highlighting.Formula`: formulas built from atoms by negation, inquisitive disjunction, `!` and
  `?`.
* `Highlighting.Formula.proposition`: the proposition a formula expresses.
* `Highlighting.Formula.highlights`: the possibilities a formula highlights, with their polarity.
* `Highlighting.Formula.toInquisitive`: the InqB formula a formula abbreviates.

## Implementation notes

The projections `!` and `?` are primitive, since `!p` and `¬¬p` highlight differently, although
in InqB they abbreviate `¬¬φ` and `φ \\/ ¬φ`; conjunction and implication are omitted, as in
Roelofsen and Farkas.
