# Probabilistic Question Semantics
[thomas-2026] [westera-brasoveanu-2014] [onea-2019]

Bayesian inquisitive answerhood. The probabilistic refinement of the
set-theoretic resolution relation in `Resolution.lean`: a state σ
"answers" a question Q under a prior μ to the extent that
conditioning μ on σ shifts mass toward some *resolution* of Q (a
conjunction of alternatives, in the inquisitive sense of
[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]).

## Key API

- `evidencesMore μ A R R'` — Bayesian comparator: `R` provides more
  evidence for `A` than `R'` does. [thomas-2026] Def 63
  (operator-level).

- `IsResolutionEvidencedBy Q 𝒜 R μ` — structure with four named
  fields capturing [thomas-2026] Def 62: `𝒜 ⊆ alt Q` is
  nonempty, `R` raises `P(⋂𝒜)`, and the impact ratio of `⋂𝒜`
  strictly dominates that of any competing intersection.

- `Answers R Q μ` — `R` answers `Q`: an evidenced resolution exists.
  [thomas-2026] Def 62.

- `resolutionEvidencedBy Q R μ : Option (Set (Set W))` — the evidenced
  resolution as a `Classical.choose`-extracted witness, `none` when
  `Answers` fails.

- `evidencesResolutionMore μ 𝒜 R R'` — resolution-level analogue of
  `evidencesMore`. [thomas-2026] Def 63.

## Note on relocated apparatus

The doxastic `Supports` / `Agree` / `Disagree` predicates previously
lived here; they have been moved to
`Studies/IppolitoKissWilliams2022.lean` (the paper
that introduced them) since their only consumer is the IKW 2025
discourse-*only* study file.

/-! ### Pointwise positive evidence

The atomic Bayesian-evidence relation: conditioning on `R` raises the
probability of `A`. The pointwise version of `IsResolutionEvidencedBy`'s
`raises_prob` field, factored out so consumers
([thomas-2026] §1.2, the IKW 2022 `Supports` predicate in
`Studies/IppolitoKissWilliams2022.lean`) can refer to
it directly. -/

/-- `R` provides **positive evidence** for `A`: conditioning on `R`
    raises the probability of `A`. -/

  μ.condProbSet R A > μ.probOfSet A

/-! ### Resolution evidenced by `R` ([thomas-2026] Def 62) -/

/-- `𝒜 ⊆ alt Q` is the resolution of `Q` evidenced by `R` under prior
    `μ`. [thomas-2026] Def 62.

    The four fields:
    * `subset_alt`  — `𝒜 ⊆ alt Q`;
    * `nonempty`    — `𝒜` is nonempty;
    * `raises_prob` — `R` raises the probability of `⋂₀ 𝒜`;
    * `dominates`   — for any other nonempty `𝒜' ⊆ alt Q` whose
      intersection does not contain `⋂₀ 𝒜`, the impact ratio of
      `⋂₀ 𝒜` strictly dominates the impact ratio of `⋂₀ 𝒜'`.

    The `⋂₀ 𝒜 ⊆ ⋂₀ 𝒜'` exclusion in `dominates` is what makes
    *weaker* resolutions (= larger intersections) not interfere with
    a stronger candidate: a weaker competitor's intersection contains
    the candidate's, so the comparison is vacuously waived. The
    intersection `⋂₀ 𝒜` is what [thomas-2026] calls "the
    resolution of `Q` evidenced by `R`" (notation `Q|_R`). -/
structure IsResolutionEvidencedBy (Q : Question W) (𝒜 : Set (Set W))
    (R : Set W) (μ : PMF W) : Prop where
  subset_alt  : 𝒜 ⊆ alt Q
  nonempty    : 𝒜.Nonempty
  raises_prob : μ.condProbSet R (⋂₀ 𝒜) > μ.probOfSet (⋂₀ 𝒜)
  dominates   : ∀ 𝒜' : Set (Set W),
    𝒜' ⊆ alt Q → 𝒜'.Nonempty → ¬ ⋂₀ 𝒜 ⊆ ⋂₀ 𝒜' →
    μ.impactRatio R (⋂₀ 𝒜) > μ.impactRatio R (⋂₀ 𝒜')

/-- Evidenced resolutions are **nested**: two resolutions of `Q` for the same
    evidence `R` have `⊆`-comparable intersections. This is the robust content
    of [thomas-2026] Def 62's "if such a set `𝒜` exists, it is unique" — the
    `dominates` field forces a chain, so the *strongest* (`⊆`-minimal)
    resolution is the canonical `Q|_R`. Full set-uniqueness does **not** hold:
    `dominates` deliberately waives competitors whose intersection contains
    `⋂₀ 𝒜`, so weaker resolutions can coexist higher in the chain. -/

    exists. [thomas-2026] Def 62. -/

/-! ### Witnessing the structure (finite worlds)

A constructor and a negative test showing the answerhood structure is both
satisfiable and genuinely discriminating. Both require `[Fintype W]`, via the
finite-PMF mass bounds of `Core/Probability/Finite.lean`. -/

section Finite
variable [Fintype W]

/-- **Constructor for a singleton evidenced resolution.** If `A` is an
    alternative of `Q`, the evidence `R` lies inside `A` and misses every *other*
    alternative (`R ∩ A' = ∅` for `A' ∈ alt Q`, `A' ≠ A`), the prior puts
    positive mass on `R`, and `A` is not full-measure, then `{A}` is a resolution
    of `Q` evidenced by `R`. The `dominates` field holds because any competitor
    not containing `A` must contain some other alternative `A'`, whose
    intersection `R` misses — giving it impact ratio `0 < μ.impactRatio R A`. -/

/-! ### Resolution-as-projection -/

/-- The evidenced resolution as `Option (Set (Set W))`: `some 𝒜` for
    some witness when `Answers R Q μ` holds, `none` otherwise.
    Witness extraction uses `Classical.choose`, hence `noncomputable`.
    Evidenced resolutions are nested
    (`IsResolutionEvidencedBy.sInter_subset_or_subset`), so the strongest is
    the canonical `Q|_R` of [thomas-2026] Def 62; `Classical.choose` need not
    return it, since full set-uniqueness fails (weaker resolutions coexist). -/

/-! ### Probabilistic relevance ([thomas-2026] Def 61)

The weaker companion of `Answers`: `R` is *relevant* to `Q` if some
alternative of `Q` has its prior shifted by conditioning on some
alternative of `R`. Used in [thomas-2026] §5.4.3 to license
*too*'s prejacent against an implicit "Relevant Question" rather than
a Current Question — an RQ need not be a CQ, only relevant to one. -/

/-- `R` is **relevant** to `Q` (under prior `μ`): some alternative of
    `R` shifts the probability of some alternative of `Q`.
    [thomas-2026] Def 61. The relation is also lifted to
    declarative-as-singleton-issue contexts via `IsRelevantOf`. -/
def IsRelevantTo (R Q : Question W) (μ : PMF W) : Prop :=
  ∃ A ∈ alt R, ∃ A' ∈ alt Q, μ.condProbSet A A' ≠ μ.probOfSet A'

/-- A *proposition* `R` is relevant to a question `Q` if conditioning
    on `R` shifts the probability of some alternative of `Q`.
    The "assertion-to-question" instance of [thomas-2026] Def 61. -/
def IsRelevantPropOf (R : Set W) (Q : Question W) (μ : PMF W) : Prop :=
  ∃ A' ∈ alt Q, μ.condProbSet R A' ≠ μ.probOfSet A'

/-- The defining unfolding of `IsRelevantPropOf`. -/
@[simp] theorem isRelevantPropOf_iff (R : Set W) (Q : Question W) (μ : PMF W) :
    IsRelevantPropOf R Q μ ↔
      ∃ A' ∈ alt Q, μ.condProbSet R A' ≠ μ.probOfSet A' :=
  Iff.rfl

/-! ### Bridge: `Answers` ⇒ `IsRelevantPropOf`

[thomas-2026] §5.1.3 asserts "all Answers are Relevant, but not all Relevant
assertions are Answers." The forward direction does not hold mechanically: a
strict inequality on `condProbSet R (⋂₀ 𝒜)` need not imply that some single
`A ∈ alt Q` has `condProbSet R A ≠ probOfSet A`, because the conditional
probability of an intersection does not decompose into those of its components
without an independence assumption. Positivity of the prior on each alternative
is **not** sufficient — `R` can correlate with the conjunction while leaving
every marginal fixed. It does hold unconditionally for **singleton**
(mention-some/one) resolutions, and in general once the prior propagates
marginal irrelevance to the resolution. -/

/-- For a **singleton** resolution `{A}`, answerhood evidence is directly
    relevance to `Q`: `R` raises `P(A)` and `A ∈ alt Q`. The mention-some/one
    instance of [thomas-2026] §5.1.3. -/
theorem IsResolutionEvidencedBy.isRelevantPropOf_singleton
    (h : IsResolutionEvidencedBy Q {A} R μ) : IsRelevantPropOf R Q μ := by
  refine ⟨A, h.subset_alt (Set.mem_singleton_iff.mpr rfl), ?_⟩
  have hr := h.raises_prob
  rw [Set.sInter_singleton] at hr
  exact ne_of_gt hr

/-- General forward bridge under an explicit independence hypothesis: if the
    prior carries marginal irrelevance (`R` shifts no alternative of `Q`) to
    the resolution `⋂₀ 𝒜`, then any evidenced resolution makes `R` relevant to
    `Q`. The hypothesis is exactly the non-degeneracy [thomas-2026] §5.1.3
    leaves implicit. -/

    (hRes : IsResolutionEvidencedBy Q 𝒜 R μ)
