# The value of a question

Relative to a decision problem, a prior over worlds and a utility for each action in each world,
an answer is worth the gain in decision value from learning it, and a question, a partition of
the worlds, is worth the expected gain from learning its answer. That expectation is the value of
information of the experiment revealing the answer, it is never negative, it vanishes exactly
when no answer changes the best action, and it reaches the value of perfect information when the
answer settles the utilities. One question refines another exactly when it is at least as useful
in every decision problem. A wh-question over a domain partitions the worlds by the predicate's
extension within the domain, so widening the domain cannot lower the question's value, and once
the domain holds every individual the utilities depend on, widening it further only makes the
question worse.

## Main statements

* `Question.utility_eq_valueOfInformation`: a question's value is the value of information of
  revealing its answer.
* `Question.utility_eq_zero_iff`: a question is worthless exactly when the best action stays best
  whatever the answer.
* `Question.le_iff_forall_utility_le`: one question refines another exactly when it is at least
  as useful in every decision problem.
* `Question.better_wh_of_factorsThrough`: a wh-domain should contain only the individuals the
  decision depends on.
