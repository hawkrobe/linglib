# Answerhood predicates on questions

This file defines the answerhood predicates over the inquisitive substrate `Question W`, with
the question as subject so that dot notation reads in the right direction. Resolution is
membership, `σ ∈ Q`, the support relation of [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]
(`Question.Support`), which under finiteness is settling some alternative
(`mem_iff_exists_alt_subset`), the mention-some reading of [groenendijk-stokhof-1984]. A state
completely answers a question when it decides every alternative (`CompletelyAnsweredBy`), the
mention-all reading, and partially answers it when it decides some alternative
(`PartiallyAnsweredBy`), the non-contextual core of [roberts-2012]'s partial answer. The
notions form the quantifier × polarity square of answerhood: resolution (∃, positive),
`PartiallyAnsweredBy` (∃, either), `CompletelyAnsweredBy` (∀, either). A question is a
contextual subquestion of another when its complete answers, cut to the context, partially
answer it (`IsSubquestionOf`), and a move is relevant to a set of questions when some
alternative of it partially answers one of them (`IsRelevantTo`).

## Implementation notes

`CompletelyAnsweredBy` decides each alternative rather than entailing every one, which would
collapse to `σ ⊆ ⋂ alt Q` and is incoherent for partition questions with disjoint
alternatives; the decided form is [groenendijk-stokhof-1984]'s strong exhaustivity on
partition questions, and `Exhaustivity.lean` builds the weak / intermediate / strong /
relativized ladder on it ([heim-1994], [george-2011], [xiang-2022]). Mention-some answerhood
is resolution itself: an added "and not all alternatives" conjunct would rule out
singleton-world states as mention-some answers to *Where can I get coffee?*. `∅` vacuously
answers everything, as in [roberts-2012].

diverging from the lattice order off partition-shaped alternatives (see
`Entailment.lean`). -/

Iff lemmas reducing the square on nontrivial `polar p` to plain `Set`
inclusions — the joints consumer-side study files build on; resolution
itself reduces without nontriviality, `mem_polar`. -/

/-! ### Decidability for polar questions -/

/-- `CompletelyAnsweredBy (polar p) σ` is decidable when the two inclusions are: on polar
questions it coincides with resolution, `mem_polar`. -/

/-! ### Relevance to a question set -/

/-- A move with denotation `den` is **relevant** to the questions in
`qs` when some alternative of `den` partially answers some question in
`qs` — the assertion clause of [roberts-2012]'s Relevance, existentially
weakened and extended to a question set (see `Discourse/QUD/Basic.lean`
for the fidelity discussion). -/
