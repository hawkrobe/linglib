# Root entailments of the Levin classes

The root-entailment signature of [beavers-koontz-garboden-2020] that each class of
[levin-1993] realizes, for the classes the literature has analysed; `none` for the rest.
`LevinClass.RootEntails` reads a single entailment off the signature, and
`LevinClass.RootPredictsCausative` is the root hypothesis for the causative alternation, read
off the signature's template.

/-- The root signature a class realizes, where one has been established: manner roots for the
activity classes, causative-result roots for the externally caused changes of state, pure
result roots for the internally caused ones, property concepts for the statives, the empty
signature for roots with no structural entailment. -/
