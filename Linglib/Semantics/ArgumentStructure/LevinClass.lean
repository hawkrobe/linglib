# The verb classes of Levin 1993

The verb classes of [levin-1993] Part II as an enumeration, one constructor per class
with a member list, with the section number and title of its entry. The classes' property tables are in `LevinClass/Properties.lean`, their member lists in
`LevinClass/Members.lean`, their root entailments in `LevinTheory.lean`, and the
`levinClasses` field of a `Verb` entry carries the classes listing it.
