# Linked frames and fusion

This file defines argument structures as linked frames and the fusion of one argument structure
with another. A linked frame is an argument frame whose slots are linked to the thematic roles they
admit, each slot either required of whatever fills the frame or open. A verb's lexical argument
structure and the meaning of an argument structure construction are both linked frames. A clause
arises when the verb's argument structure is fused with an event structure: a correspondence
between their slots under which every pair of corresponding slots admits a common role, every slot
the verb requires is fused, and every slot the event structure requires is filled. The slots of
the event structure that nothing fuses with are contributed by it.

## Main definitions

* `RoleSlot`, `LinkedFrame`: a slot's admitted roles, and a frame with its slots linked
* `LinkedFrame.IsProfiled`: a slot is profiled when it is a core slot of the frame
* `LinkedFrame.Extends`: one argument structure admits at least the roles of another
* `IsFusion`: a correspondence of slots obeying coherence and the two obligations
* `contributed`: the slots of the event structure no slot of the verb fuses with
* `SubeventRelation`: how the verb's event relates to the event structure's

## Main results

* `IsFusion.exists_fused`: an event structure with a required slot shares a participant with every
  verb fused with it
* `isFusion_refl`: the identity correspondence fuses an argument structure with itself

## Implementation notes

The roles a slot admits form a set of `ThetaRole` labels, and two slots are compatible when their
sets meet. A correspondence is a map from slots to optional slots; `IsFusionOn` restates `IsFusion`
over the verb's slots so that it can be decided, and `ofFin` builds a correspondence from a map
between slot indices.
