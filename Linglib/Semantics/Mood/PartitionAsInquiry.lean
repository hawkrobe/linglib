# Partition as Inquiry — Setoid → Question embedding
[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] [theiler-etal-2018]
[puncochar-2019]

The faithful embedding of partition-based inquiry (`Setoid W` — what
`State.inquiry` carries) into the more general inquisitive-content
representation (`Question W` — downward-closed nonempty
families of information states).

## Architectural placement

This file implements the embedding direction prescribed in the
"Architectural note: Setoid vs. Question" section of
`State.lean` (added 0.229.922): we keep `inquiry : Setoid W` as the
field of `State` (partitions are the right shape for the propositional-
discourse use cases that currently exist), and provide a *one-way*
embedding `Setoid → Question`. The embedding goes this way
and not the other because every Setoid-based partition can be expressed
as an Question (each equivalence class becomes a maximal
proposition / alternative), but the reverse fails — mention-some,
intermediate-exhaustive, and conditional question alternatives are
non-disjoint or non-exhaustive and so are not representable as the
classes of any equivalence relation (see [theiler-etal-2018]).

This mirrors mathlib's `Set.toFinset` / `Filter.principal` /
`UniformSpace.toTopologicalSpace` pattern: the "less general" structure
sits inside the "more general" one via a faithful but not surjective
forgetful map.

## What this gives us

- `fromSetoid r : Question W` — the inquisitive content whose
  alternatives are the equivalence classes of `r`. Concretely,
  `props = {q | q = ∅ ∨ ∃ c ∈ r.classes, q ⊆ c}`: a non-empty information
  state `q` resolves the issue iff it is contained in some equivalence
  class (i.e., everything in `q` is `r`-equivalent).
- `info_fromSetoid` — informative content is `Set.univ`. Setoid-based
  inquiry is **non-informative**: it raises an issue but supplies no
  information. (This matches the standard partition-semantics view.)
- `isInquisitive_fromSetoid_of_two_classes` — if `r` has at least two
  distinct equivalence classes, the resulting content is inquisitive
  (in `Question`'s sense: `info ∉ props`). The trivial
  partition (one class) yields a declarative.

namespace Question

universe u
variable {W : Type u}

/-- The Question associated with a setoid `r` on `W`: a
    proposition `q` resolves the issue iff `q = ∅` or `q` is contained
    in some `r`-equivalence class (i.e., everything in `q` agrees on the
    `r`-question). The maximal such propositions are the equivalence
    classes themselves. -/
def fromSetoid (r : Setoid W) : Question W :=
  ofLowerSet {q | q = ∅ ∨ ∃ c ∈ r.classes, q ⊆ c} (Or.inl rfl) <| by
    rintro a b hba (rfl | ⟨c, hc, hac⟩)
    · exact Or.inl (Set.subset_empty_iff.mp hba)
    · exact Or.inr ⟨c, hc, hba.trans hac⟩

/-- The informative content of a partition-based inquiry is the whole
    universe: every world is in some equivalence class, so every world
    appears in some resolving proposition. Setoid-derived inquisitive
    contents are **non-informative** — they raise issues but provide no
    information. -/
theorem info_fromSetoid (r : Setoid W) : (fromSetoid r).info = Set.univ := by
  ext w
  simp only [info, fromSetoid, props_ofLowerSet, Set.mem_sUnion, Set.mem_setOf_eq,
             Set.mem_univ, iff_true]
  refine ⟨{x | r x w}, ?_, ?_⟩
  · exact Or.inr ⟨{x | r x w}, Setoid.mem_classes r w, subset_rfl⟩
  · exact Setoid.refl' r w

/-- If a setoid has two distinct equivalence classes, the resulting
    inquisitive content is inquisitive: `Set.univ` is not contained in
    any single equivalence class (it would have to coincide with both),
    so `info ∉ props`. -/

    (r : Setoid W) (w₁ w₂ : W) (hne : ¬ r w₁ w₂) :
    (fromSetoid r).isInquisitive := by
  show (fromSetoid r).info ∉ (fromSetoid r).props
  rw [info_fromSetoid]

  · exact (huniv ▸ Set.mem_univ w₁ : w₁ ∈ (∅ : Set W)).elim
  · obtain ⟨v, hv, rfl⟩ := hc

    exact hne (Setoid.trans' r h1 (Setoid.symm' r h2))

/-! ### Setoid–Question bridge: refinement = entailment

The `fromSetoid` embedding is **monotone** in mathlib's lattice order on
`Setoid` (where `r₁ ≤ r₂` iff `r₁` is *finer*: `r₁.Rel x y → r₂.Rel x y`)
and the entailment order on `Question` (`P ≤ Q` iff `P.props ⊆ Q.props`).
The bridge is moreover a **lattice embedding**: `≤` is reflected back.

This is the Set-based form of Groenendijk–Stokhof's "partition refinement
= question entailment", formulated as a one-liner over `Setoid` and
`Question` with no `worlds : List W` quantifier and no `isPartition`
precondition. -/

/-- The `Setoid → Question` embedding **reflects** the order: a setoid is
    finer than another iff its inquisitive content is entailed by the
    other's. The forward direction is monotonicity; the backward
    direction uses the fact that `r`-equivalent pairs are resolved by
    the two-element state `{x, y}`, which any cell-membership theorem
    can recover. -/
theorem fromSetoid_le_iff (r₁ r₂ : Setoid W) :
    fromSetoid r₁ ≤ fromSetoid r₂ ↔ r₁ ≤ r₂ := by
  refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩
  · -- ≤ on Question → ≤ on Setoid: take r₁-related x y; the doubleton
    -- {x, y} resolves fromSetoid r₁, hence resolves fromSetoid r₂.
    intro hle x y hxy
    have hpair : ({x, y} : Set W) ∈ fromSetoid r₁ := by
      refine Or.inr ⟨{z | r₁ z x}, Setoid.mem_classes r₁ x, ?_⟩

      have hyv : r₂ y v := hsub (Set.mem_insert_of_mem x rfl)
      exact Setoid.trans' r₂ hxv (Setoid.symm' r₂ hyv)
  · -- ≤ on Setoid → ≤ on Question: a state contained in an r₁-cell is
    -- contained in the surrounding r₂-cell (cells only widen).

    · subst hempty; exact (fromSetoid r₂).contains_empty
    · obtain ⟨v, _hv, rfl⟩ := hc

theorem fromSetoid_mono {r₁ r₂ : Setoid W} (h : r₁ ≤ r₂) :
    fromSetoid r₁ ≤ fromSetoid r₂ :=
  (fromSetoid_le_iff r₁ r₂).mpr h

/-! ### Equivalence classes are alternatives -/

/-- Conversely, every alternative of `fromSetoid r` is either the empty
    state or an equivalence class of `r`. The empty case can only occur
    when `W` is empty (otherwise some class is in `props` and strictly
    contains `∅`, displacing it from maximality). -/
theorem alt_fromSetoid_subset_classes (r : Setoid W) {p : Set W}
    (hp : p ∈ alt (fromSetoid r)) : p = ∅ ∨ p ∈ r.classes := by
  obtain ⟨hp_props, hmax⟩ := hp
  rcases hp_props with hempty | ⟨c, hc, hpc⟩
  · exact Or.inl hempty
  · -- p ⊆ c, but c is itself in props (Or.inr ⟨c, hc, subset_rfl⟩),
    -- so by maximality p = c, hence p is the class c.
    have hc_props : c ∈ (fromSetoid r).props :=
      Or.inr ⟨c, hc, subset_rfl⟩
    have heq : p = c := hmax c hc_props hpc
    exact Or.inr (heq ▸ hc)

/-- Each equivalence class of `r` is a maximal element (alternative) of
    `fromSetoid r`. The proof uses (i) classes are nonempty (so they
    aren't displaced by `∅`), and (ii) classes are pairwise disjoint or
    equal — so a class can only be properly contained in itself. -/
theorem class_mem_alt_fromSetoid (r : Setoid W) {c : Set W}
    (hc : c ∈ r.classes) : c ∈ alt (fromSetoid r) := by
  refine ⟨Or.inr ⟨c, hc, subset_rfl⟩, ?_⟩
  obtain ⟨v, _hv, rfl⟩ := hc
  intro q hq hcq
  rcases hq with hempty | ⟨c', hc', hqc'⟩
  · -- q = ∅, but v ∈ class is contained in q
    have hv : v ∈ ({x | r x v} : Set W) := Setoid.refl' r v
    rw [hempty] at hcq
    exact (hcq hv).elim
  · -- q ⊆ c'; since {x | r x v} ⊆ q ⊆ c', the two classes coincide
    obtain ⟨v', _hv', rfl⟩ := hc'
    have hvv' : r v v' := hqc' (hcq (Setoid.refl' r v))
    apply Set.Subset.antisymm hcq
    intro x hxq
    have hxv' : r x v' := hqc' hxq
    exact Setoid.trans' r hxv' (Setoid.symm' r hvv')

/-! ## State bridge

Lift the partition-based inquiry component of a `State` to its full
`Question`. This makes every existing State-using study
automatically a consumer of the inquisitive-content API: `info`,
`alt`, `isInquisitive`, the lattice operations, and the
mention-some/IE-question forcing arguments all become available
without rewriting the underlying state. -/
