# The generic operator

This file defines the generic operator GEN of characterizing sentences as the conditional
quantifying over the normal cases of its restrictor. [krifka-etal-1995] survey the ways of
spelling GEN out. On the prototype analysis a characterizing sentence quantifies universally over
the typical instances of its restrictor, (80) and (81); on relevant quantification it quantifies
over the restrictor cases that meet a contextual restriction, (78); on the modal analysis it is a
conditional evaluated at the most normal worlds of a modal base, (86). Each picks out, for a
restrictor, a set of normal cases inside it, and the generic holds when the matrix holds
throughout that set. A normality is such a selection (`Normality`), and GEN is the conditional
over its domain (`Normality.gen`), the domain conditional `Conditional.ofDomain` of the
conditionals file.

Unlike the universal, GEN tolerates exceptions, (74) (`Normality.exists_mem_gen_not_subset`),
though a universal generalization is a generic one (`Normality.gen_eq_univ_of_subset`), and when
every case is normal it is the universal (`Normality.mem_gen_top`). A normality given by a fixed
set of normal cases, as on relevant quantification, makes GEN the strict conditional
(`Normality.ofAccess`, `Normality.gen_ofAccess`). It overgenerates, since the restriction can be
the matrix itself, [krifka-etal-1995]'s (79) (`Normality.gen_ofAccess_self`).
A normality given by a preorder on the cases makes GEN the conditional of the best accessible
cases (`Normality.ofOrdering`, `Normality.gen_ofOrdering`). Whatever the normality, two generics
with one restrictor and disjoint matrices leave the restrictor no normal case, and then every
generic with that restrictor is true. This is the problem of (82) for the prototype analysis:
male ducks have colorful feathers and female ducks lay whitish eggs, so no duck is typical for
both, and every sentence *a duck Fs* comes out true (`Normality.normal_eq_empty_of_disjoint`,
`Normality.mem_gen_of_disjoint`). Generics with disjoint matrices and different restrictors
select disjoint normal cases (`Normality.disjoint_normal_of_disjoint`).

## Main definitions

* `Genericity.Normality`: a selection of the normal cases of each restrictor.
* `Genericity.Normality.gen`: GEN, the conditional over the normal cases.
* `Genericity.Normality.ofAccess`, `Genericity.Normality.ofOrdering`: normality by a fixed set
  of normal cases and by a preorder.

## Implementation notes

* GEN is evaluated at an index (a world, a world and a time, a context) and quantifies over cases
  of another type (individuals, events, situations, worlds), so a normality has both as
  parameters. Restrictors and matrices are sets of cases, as for the conditionals.
* The one law every analysis shares is that the normal cases of a restrictor are among its cases.
  Normality is not monotone in the restrictor: the normal penguins need not be normal birds.

## TODO

* The probabilistic generic of [cohen-1999a] and [tessler-goodman-2019], a threshold on the
  conditional probability of the matrix given the restrictor, on mathlib measures.
* The generics of `Studies/Kirkpatrick2023`, `Studies/KadmonLandman1993` and
  `Studies/DelPrete2013` on `Normality`, and the homogeneity presupposition of GEN of
  `Studies/Magri2009` beside `Conditional.homogeneityCounterfactual`.
