# Verb denotation — what a verb *does*

A verb is, first of all, an **operation**: applied to its arguments it builds an
event predicate. This file is that operation — the DO layer of the Verb API —
parallel to how the φ substrate models person features as *operations* rather
than predicates.

For a change-of-state verb the operation is the [beavers-koontz-garboden-2020]
§1.3.2 decomposition (`Verb.CosModel`): a root denotes a state predicate and the
event predicate is built by `become'`/`cause'`, dispatched on the root's `kinds`.
The proto-role theta-grid (`Verb.subjectRole`/`objectRole`, derived from the
effective `EntailmentProfile`s via `EntailmentProfile.toRole`) supplies the
participant roles.

## Main definitions

* `Verb.subjectRole` / `Verb.objectRole` — the theta-grid from the proto-role
  profiles
* `Verb.CosModel` + `inchoative`/`causative`/`denote` — the change-of-state
  denotation, dispatched on the root's `kinds`
* `CosModel.again` + `againRestitutive`/`againRepetitiveBecome`/`againRepetitiveCause`
  — the sublexical *again* operator and its three attachment readings

## Main results

* `CosModel.causative_entails_inchoative`, `denote_result_entails_resultState` —
  the [beavers-koontz-garboden-2020] entailments, *derived* from the root signature
* `CosModel.againPresup_cause_entails_state`, `result_restitution_entails_change`
  — the [beavers-koontz-garboden-2020] (25) reading hierarchy and the result-root
  restitutive collapse, *derived* from the change-of-state entailments

/-! ### Change-of-state decomposition ([beavers-koontz-garboden-2020] §1.3.2)

For a change-of-state verb the opaque lexical core unpacks into the
event-structural decomposition of [beavers-koontz-garboden-2020] (22)–(24): a
root denotes a *state* predicate `⟦√V⟧(x,s)`, and the verb's event predicate is
built by the templatic operators `become'` and `cause'`. The root's
`kinds` selects which operators apply — `.result` → `become`,
`.cause` → `cause`/`effector` — so the decomposition is the denotational payoff
of the root's kinds. -/

    templatic primitives a COS verb's denotation is built from. `become`/`cause`/

    their §1.6); a Study instantiates them. -/

/-! ### Sublexical *again* — the restitutive/repetitive hierarchy
    ([beavers-koontz-garboden-2020] §1.3.2, exs (25)–(27))

`again` is a presupposition trigger that can attach at three points in the
change-of-state structure — the root, `vbecome`, or `vcause` — yielding the three
readings of *Mary flattened the rug again* in BKG (25): restitutive ("it had been
flat", a prior **state**), repetitive over the change ("it had flattened", a prior
**become** event), and repetitive over the causation ("Mary had flattened it", a
prior **cause** event). BKG (26) (a simplified [von-stechow-1996]) defines
`⟦again⟧ = λPλe. P(e) ∧ ∂∃e′[e′ ≪ e ∧ P(e′)]`: `P` of the eventuality, plus the
presupposition (`∂`) of a strictly earlier `P`-eventuality (`e′ ≪ e`). The reading
hierarchy `(25c) ⊨ (25b) ⊨ (25a)` and the result-root collapse (§2.4, exs
(43)/(45): a result root's state entails its own change, so even root-scope
*again* is repetitive) fall out of the change-of-state entailments above. -/

/-- BKG (26): the sublexical modifier *again*. Given a precedence `≪` (`lt`) on an
    eventuality type `ι` and a predicate `P`, *again* asserts `P e` and presupposes
    a strictly earlier `e′ ≪ e` with `P e′`. Following BKG we do not analyse the
    `∂` operator further — the earlier-eventuality conjunct *is* the presupposition
    (`againPresup`). -/
def again {ι : Type*} (lt : ι → ι → Prop) (P : ι → Prop) (e : ι) : Prop :=
  P e ∧ ∃ e', lt e' e ∧ P e'

/-- The presupposition *again* contributes (BKG (26), the `∂`-marked conjunct):
    a strictly earlier eventuality also satisfying `P`. -/
def againPresup {ι : Type*} (lt : ι → ι → Prop) (P : ι → Prop) (e : ι) : Prop :=
  ∃ e', lt e' e ∧ P e'

theorem again_iff {ι : Type*} (lt : ι → ι → Prop) (P : ι → Prop) (e : ι) :
    again lt P e ↔ P e ∧ againPresup lt P e := Iff.rfl

/-- BKG (27a): *again* attached low, to the root `√V`. The asserted/presupposed
    predicate is the root **state**, so the presupposition is of a strictly
    earlier root-state of the patient — the restitutive reading. -/

    (ltS : State → State → Prop) (v : Verb) (x : Entity) (s : State) : Prop :=
  again ltS (M.rootState v x) s

/-- BKG (27b): *again* attached to `vbecomeP`. The predicate is the inchoative
    **change** event, so the presupposition is of a strictly earlier change —
    the repetitive-over-change reading. -/
def againRepetitiveBecome (M : CosModel Entity State Time)
    (ltE : Event Time → Event Time → Prop) (v : Verb) (x : Entity)
    (e : Event Time) : Prop :=
  again ltE (M.inchoative v x) e

/-- BKG (27c): *again* attached high, to `vcauseP`. The predicate is the
    causative **causing** event, so the presupposition is of a strictly earlier
    causation — the repetitive-over-causation reading. -/
def againRepetitiveCause (M : CosModel Entity State Time)
    (ltE : Event Time → Event Time → Prop) (v : Verb) (y x : Entity)

/-- BKG (25) hierarchy, upper step: the repetitive-causation presupposition (25c,
    "Mary had flattened it before") entails the repetitive-change presupposition
    (25b, "it had flattened before") — the earlier causing event *is* an earlier
    change, by `causative_entails_inchoative`. The `≪`-witness is carried through. -/

  exact ⟨w', hlt, M.causative_entails_inchoative v y x w' hcaus⟩

/-- BKG (25) hierarchy, lower step: the repetitive-change presupposition (25b,
    "it had flattened before") entails the restitutive presupposition (25a, "it
    had been flat before") — the earlier change gives rise to an earlier root
    state, by `inchoative_entails_resultState`. -/

  exact ⟨e', hlt, M.inchoative_entails_resultState v x e' hinch⟩

/-- BKG (25) hierarchy, end to end: the repetitive-causation presupposition (25c)
    entails the restitutive presupposition (25a) — "Mary had flattened it before"
    ⊨ "it had been flat before". The two steps composed through the change-of-state
    decomposition (`causative_entails_resultState`). -/
theorem againPresup_cause_entails_state (M : CosModel Entity State Time)

  obtain ⟨w', hlt, hcaus⟩ := h
  exact ⟨w', hlt, M.causative_entails_resultState v y x w' hcaus⟩

/-- BKG §2.4 (45): for a *result* root the root state itself entails a prior
    change (`∃ become`), so even the low/restitutive attachment of *again* over
    the root carries a change entailment — the restitutive reading collapses into
    the repetitive one ([beavers-koontz-garboden-2020]: "result roots never admit
    truly restitutive readings"). Formally, the restitutive presupposition (an earlier
    state) already delivers an earlier change. The premise `hres` is BKG (45a)'s
    meaning, realized by a root whose `closedKinds` contain `.result` (cf.
    `denote_result_entails_resultState`). -/
theorem result_restitution_entails_change (M : CosModel Entity State Time)
