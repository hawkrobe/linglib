# Focus antecedents

The anaphoric source of the squiggle's contrast set ([rooth-1992]):
what the preceding discourse supplies — a question, a prior assertion
to correct, explicitly offered alternatives, or a parallel focus, the
four contexts that control a focus in [hartmann-zimmermann-2007] §1.2,
the notion of control being [uhmann-1991]'s. `Use` classifies the shapes;
felicity (`Antecedent.Admits`) is containment of the antecedent's
contrast set in the focus value, uniformly across uses — and `use_not_factorsThrough_contrastSet`
shows the four-way split is invisible to the semantics.

`SquiggleSet`/`SquiggleInd` state the full presuppositions of
[rooth-1992]'s ~ operator (his (40), set and individual cases):
`Admits` is only the first set-case clause, and the contrast clauses
are what make ~ anaphorically demanding — `not_squiggleSet_unfeatured`
derives "the argument must contain a focus" from the unit focus value
of focus-free phrases. `Antecedent.Resolves` routes each antecedent
shape through the appropriate case.

## Implementation notes

Payloads are flat Hamblin sets, `Set (Set W)`, keeping antecedents over finite models
`decide`-friendly; a `Question` supplies one through `Question.alt`. The `assertion` payload
is a raw prior proposition; the `HasAssertion` hookup (a correction/denial move) is deferred.

/-! ### The squiggle presupposition

[rooth-1992]'s ~ operator introduces the presuppositions of its (40),
over an ordinary value `o` and focus value `fv` of any type: in the set
case the resolved antecedent `Γ` is a subset of `fv` containing `o` and
a distinct alternative; in the individual case the antecedent is a
member of `fv` distinct from `o`. `Admits` is the first set-case clause;
the contrast clauses are what make ~ anaphorically demanding. -/
