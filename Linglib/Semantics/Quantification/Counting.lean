# Counting generalized quantifiers

The counting quantifiers *most*, *few*, *half*, *both*, *neither*, *at least n*, *at most n*,
*exactly n*, *all but n* and *between n and k* hold of `A` and `B` according to `|A \ B|` and
`|A ∩ B|` alone, so each is the quantifier of a set of points on van Benthem's tree of numbers.
Defined that way they are conservative and permutation invariant by construction, and their
monotonicity, smoothness and proportionality are read off the tree. Sizes are `Set.ncard`,
which asks for no decidability. On a finite type with decidable arguments each quantifier is
decidable through the `Finset` count of each size, so a concrete case closes by `decide`. A
quantifier restricted to a finite set `s` of individuals is the quantifier with restrictor
`x ∈ s ∧ A x`.

## Main definitions

* `Quantifier.NumberTree.most`, `Quantifier.NumberTree.atLeast`, …: the trees of the counting
  quantifiers, with `Quantifier.NumberTree.threshold` for a proportion of the restrictor.
* `Quantifier.GQ.most`, `Quantifier.GQ.atLeast`, …: their quantifiers.
* `Quantifier.GQ.Proportional`: dependence on the ratio of `|A ∩ B|` to `|A \ B|`.

## Main results

* `Quantifier.GQ.smooth_most`, `Quantifier.GQ.proportional_most`: *most* is smooth and
  proportional.
* `Quantifier.NumberTree.thresholdGt_one_two`: *more than half* is *most*.
* `Quantifier.GQ.not_existential_most`, `Quantifier.GQ.not_monotone_half`: *most* is not
  existential, and *half* is monotone in its scope in neither direction.
