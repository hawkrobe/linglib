# Numeral meanings

This file collects what is specific to numerals over the degree comparisons of
`Semantics/Degree/Comparison.lean`. A bare numeral and its four modifications, *more than*,
*fewer than*, *at least* and *at most*, are the five comparisons of `Degree.Comparison`: in
Kennedy's de-Fregean semantics the form with relation `REL` and number `m` is true of a degree
property whose greatest degree stands in `REL` to `m`. On counts the form denotes the interval
`c.interval m`, and on worlds measured by `μ` the set `μ ⁻¹' c.interval m`, so the forms have no
names of their own here. The meanings of the modified forms are common ground. Accounts differ on
the bare numeral, which has the two-sided meaning `Comparison.eq.interval m` for Kennedy and the
lower-bounded meaning `Comparison.ge.interval m` in the tradition of Horn, each account deriving the
other reading. Exhaustifying the lower-bounded meaning against the scale of higher numerals gives
the two-sided one, and Kennedy's type lowering, existential closure over the two-sided meaning at
the degrees above, takes it to the lower-bounded one.

## Main definitions

* `Numerals.ModifierClass`, `Numerals.ModifierKind`: Nouwen's two classes of numeral modifier
  and the constructions modifiers are built on, with `ModifierKind.modifierClass`.
* `Numerals.Modifier`: a numeral modifier as a lexical item, its form, kind and readings, each
  reading a `Modifier (Set ℕ)` of sets of amounts.
* `Numerals.exhNumeral`: the lower-bounded meaning exhaustified against the next numeral.

## Main results

* `Numerals.exhNumeral_eq`: the exhaustified lower-bounded meaning is the two-sided one.
* `Numerals.mem_exhNumeral_iff_exhChain`: exhaustifying against the next numeral is
  exhaustifying against the whole scale.

/-! ### Numeral modifiers -/

/-- The two classes of numeral modifiers of [nouwen-2010]. A Class A modifier relates the
numeral to a definite amount, so *a hexagon has fewer than 11 sides* is a weak truth. A Class B
modifier places a bound on a range of amounts, so *a hexagon has at most 10 sides* is odd and
the modifier conveys that the speaker does not know the amount.

[kennedy-2015] reduces the split to the ordering the modifier expresses, exclusive for Class A
and inclusive for Class B (`Degree.Comparison.boundary_mem`), and derives the ignorance as an
implicature. The categorical pattern is contested, since [schwarz-buccola-hamilton-2012] show
that *at most* and *up to* dissociate, [cremers-coppock-dotlacil-roelofsen-2022] find the ignorance
contrast graded and dependent on the question under discussion, and [enguehard-2018] derives
the inferences of comparative numerals from granularity. -/

/-! ### Exhaustification

On the account of [chierchia-fox-spector-2012] that [spector-2013] discusses, the bare numeral
has the lower-bounded meaning and its two-sided reading comes from a covert exhaustivity
operator, which asserts *at least `m`* and denies *at least `m + 1`*. [kennedy-2015] runs the
derivation the other way, lowering the two-sided meaning to the lower-bounded one. -/
