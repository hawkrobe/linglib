# Numeral roundness

A number is round by having roundness properties: for Sigurd, divisibility by a power of ten
from ten up or by its half or quarter; for Jansen and Pollmann, 10-ness, 2-ness, 5-ness and
2½-ness, `k`-ness being a digit times `k` times a power of ten; for Woodin et al., these over
positive powers of ten together with being a multiple of five or of ten; and for Haslinger, lying
on the conventionalized scales salient in a context, Krifka's scales of multiples of a width.

Numbers and properties form a formal context. A number is at least as round as another when it
has every property the other has, Haslinger's ordering, so the numbers at least as round as `d`
are the extent closure of `d`; counting properties gives the roundness scores. On scales of
multiples the closure is again a scale, the multiples of the lcm of the widths through `d`.

## Main definitions

* `Numerals.Roundness.AtLeastAsRound`: having every roundness property of a number.
* `Numerals.Roundness.score`: the number of roundness properties a number has.
* `Numerals.Roundness.OnScale`: lying on a scale of multiples.
* `Numerals.Roundness.HasKness`, `Numerals.Roundness.Kness`: Jansen and Pollmann's `k`-ness and
  its four kinds, over powers of ten from a given one.

## Main statements

* `Numerals.Roundness.atLeastAsRound_iff_mem_extentClosure`: the numbers at least as round as `d`
  are its extent closure.
* `Numerals.Roundness.extentClosure_onScale`: on scales of multiples, that closure is the scale of
  multiples of `scaleLcm W d`.
* `Numerals.Roundness.atLeastAsRound_onScale_iff_dvd`: roundness on scales of multiples is
  divisibility of these lcms.

## Implementation notes

A roundness property is an attribute of the formal context `r : D → ι → Prop`, so a family of
properties and a set of salient scales are the same kind of object. Woodin et al.'s regression
weights the properties unequally; `score` counts them equally.
