# Graded Numeral Roundness (k-ness Model)
[krifka-2007] [sigurd-1988] [woodin-etal-2023] [jansen-pollmann-2001] [cummins-2015]

Framework-agnostic infrastructure for graded numeral roundness,
following [sigurd-1988], [jansen-pollmann-2001], and [woodin-etal-2023].

A number n has **k-ness** if it lies in [jansen-pollmann-2001]'s set
[k × (1–9 × 10ⁿ)] (their p. 198): n = m × k × 10^b with 1 ≤ m ≤ 9 —
so 10-ness is the k = 1 family (divisors 10, 100, …), per their own
example "70 has only 10-ness". Their original allows b ≥ 0; following
[woodin-etal-2023] (fn. 3) the search starts at b ≥ 1, which drops the
single digits from 10-ness and 15, 45, … from 5-ness (cf.
`Studies/JansenPollmann2001.lean` for the original and the divergence).

The 6 properties, ordered by strength as frequency predictors in
[woodin-etal-2023]'s negative binomial regression (strongest first):
10-ness (β = 4.46), 2.5-ness (β = 3.84), 5-ness (β = 3.39),
2-ness (β = 2.74), multiple of 10 (β = 2.45), multiple of 5 (β = 0.06);
the 2-ness and multiple-of-10 credible intervals overlap.

## Main definitions

- `HasKness`, `Has2_5ness`: the k-ness properties as decidable predicates
- `roundnessScore`: count of the six properties that hold (0–6)
- `RoundnessGrade`, `roundnessGrade`: the score binned into 4 levels
- `contextualRoundnessScore`, `roundnessInContext`: k-ness relative to a
  non-standard base (dozens, minutes)

/-! ### k-ness primitives -/

/-- `n` has integer k-ness: `n = m × k × 10^b` for some `b ≥ 1` and
`1 ≤ m ≤ 9` ([jansen-pollmann-2001]). The witness search is bounded at
`b ≤ 10`, valid for `n < 10¹¹`. -/
def HasKness (n k : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∃ b < 11, 1 ≤ b ∧ ∃ m < 10, 1 ≤ m ∧ n = m * k * 10 ^ b

instance (n k : ℕ) : Decidable (HasKness n k) :=
  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (∃ b < 11, 1 ≤ b ∧ ∃ m < 10, 1 ≤ m ∧ n = m * k * 10 ^ b))

/-- `n` has 2.5-ness: `n = m × 2.5 × 10^b` for `b ≥ 1`, `1 ≤ m ≤ 9` —
equivalently `2n = m × 5 × 10^b`. Search bounded as in `HasKness`. -/
def Has2_5ness (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∃ b < 11, 1 ≤ b ∧ ∃ m < 10, 1 ≤ m ∧ 2 * n = m * 5 * 10 ^ b

instance (n : ℕ) : Decidable (Has2_5ness n) :=
  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (∃ b < 11, 1 ≤ b ∧ ∃ m < 10, 1 ≤ m ∧ 2 * n = m * 5 * 10 ^ b))

/-! ### Roundness score

The six graded roundness properties of [sigurd-1988] and
[jansen-pollmann-2001] — multiple of 5, multiple of 10, 2-ness, 2.5-ness,
5-ness, 10-ness — counted equally. The count predicts numeral frequency
and pragmatic behavior ([woodin-etal-2023]). -/

/-- Count of true roundness properties (0–6). Higher = rounder. -/
def roundnessScore (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  (if 5 ∣ n then 1 else 0) + (if 10 ∣ n then 1 else 0) +
  (if HasKness n 2 then 1 else 0) + (if Has2_5ness n then 1 else 0) +
  (if HasKness n 5 then 1 else 0) + (if HasKness n 1 then 1 else 0)

/-- Maximum possible roundness score. -/
def maxRoundnessScore : ℕ := 6

/-! ### Roundness grade (binned score) -/

/--
Binned roundness grade for use in width/tolerance functions.

Collapses the 0–6 score into 4 levels to avoid duplicating
step-function logic across Theory files.
-/
inductive RoundnessGrade where
  /-- score ≥ 5 (e.g., 100, 50, 200) -/
  | high
  /-- score 3–4 (e.g., 20, 40) -/
  | moderate
  /-- score 1–2 (e.g., 110, 15) -/
  | low
  /-- score 0 (e.g., 7, 99) -/
  | none

def roundnessGrade (n : ℕ) : RoundnessGrade :=
  if roundnessScore n ≥ 5 then .high
  else if roundnessScore n ≥ 3 then .moderate
  else if roundnessScore n ≥ 1 then .low
  else .none

/-! ### Context-sensitive roundness -/

/--
Count k-ness-like properties relative to a non-standard base.

For base b, checks divisibility by b, 2b, 5b, and 10b — mirroring
the standard k-ness properties but on a different scale.

Examples:
- contextualRoundnessScore 48 12 = 2 (48 ÷ 12 = 4, 48 ÷ 24 = 2)
- contextualRoundnessScore 120 12 = 4 (divides by 12, 24, 60, 120)
-/
def contextualRoundnessScore (n : ℕ) (base : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  if base ≤ 1 ∨ n = 0 then 0
  else
    (if base ∣ n then 1 else 0) + (if base * 2 ∣ n then 1 else 0) +
    (if base * 5 ∣ n then 1 else 0) + (if base * 10 ∣ n then 1 else 0)

/--
Context-sensitive roundness: compose default k-ness with a non-standard base.

On a base-12 (dozens) scale, 48 = 4 × 12 is "round" even though its
default k-ness score is 0. On base-60 (minutes), 120 = 2 × 60 is round.

The contextual score derives from actual divisibility properties relative
to the base (not a flat bonus), paralleling how standard k-ness derives
from divisibility by 2/2.5/5/10 × powers of 10.
-/
def roundnessInContext (n : ℕ) (base : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  max (roundnessScore n) (contextualRoundnessScore n base)
