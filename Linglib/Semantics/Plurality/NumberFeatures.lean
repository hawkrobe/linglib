# The feature decomposition of number

Harbour decomposes the three basic number values into two features, [±atomic] and [±minimal]. A
bundle is the set of its positive features, and it passes the containment filter when they form a
lower set of the chain minimal < atomic, so the three values are the chain's initial segments. For
number the filter follows from the semantics: an atom is minimal in every region excluding the
null individual (`Number.singular_subset_minimal`), so [+atomic, −minimal] corresponds to no
number, as Harbour observes. Lattice elements are classified by the regions of `Number.interp`.

## Main definitions

* `Number.Feature`, `Number.Features`: the two features and their bundles, with
  `Features.toNumber` and `Features.ofNumber` relating bundles to `Number`.
* `Number.latticeToFeatures`: the bundle a lattice element realizes in a region, singular on its
  atoms, dual on its minimal non-atoms, plural otherwise.
* `Number.dualPredOnLattice`: the dual as a predicate modifier.

## Main results

* `Number.card_wellFormed`: exactly three bundles pass the containment filter.
* `Number.toNumber_isSome_iff`, `Number.ofNumber_toNumber`, `Number.toNumber_ofNumber`: bundles
  and values correspond on those cells.
* `Number.latticeToFeatures_wellFormed`: classification never produces the filtered cell.
* `Number.dualPredOnLattice_iff`: the dual predicate modifier is the restriction to elements
  classified `dualF`.

## Implementation notes

Harbour argues that the features are bivalent, a privative encoding collapsing values such as
unit augmented and minimal; a bundle here is the set of positive values of a bivalent valuation,
the negative values being its complement. The examples use the powerset lattice `Finset (Fin n)`
on its nonempty subsets, whose atoms are the singletons.
