# Embedded tense: the Upper Limit Constraint and past under past

A tense embedded under an attitude verb is evaluated from the attitude holder's now. Abusch makes
that local evaluation time an upper limit for the denotation of tenses, and accepts Heim's
construal of the constraint as a presupposition of every tense node. As a constraint on how the
reference time of a tense stands to its local evaluation time, the Upper Limit Constraint is the
cell of the past and the present positions (`upperLimitConstraint`).

A past under a past attitude places its reference time before the attitude's now. In a language
with the Sequence of Tense rule the embedded past may instead be deleted and read as a zero tense
bound to the now, so it coincides with it. The positions an embedded past may take are therefore
the past cell, joined with the present cell where the rule applies (`pastUnderPast`). Every such
position obeys the Upper Limit Constraint, and the positions exhaust it exactly where the rule
applies.

## Main definitions

* `Tense.upperLimitConstraint`: the Upper Limit Constraint, the cell of the past and the present.
* `Tense.pastUnderPast`: the positions of an embedded past against the attitude's now.

## Main results

* `Tense.pastUnderPast_le_upperLimitConstraint`, `Tense.pastUnderPast_eq_upperLimitConstraint_iff`:
  every reading of a past under a past obeys the constraint, and the readings exhaust it exactly
  where the Sequence of Tense rule applies.
* `Tense.eq_mem_pastUnderPast_iff`: the simultaneous reading is available exactly where the rule
  applies.

## Implementation notes

Abusch motivates the constraint by the branching of the future across epistemic alternatives;
that motivation is not formalized here, and the derivation of the cell from a doxastic modal base
is Klecha's (`Studies/Klecha2016.lean`).
