# The domains of φ-features

Following Sauerland, a φ-feature is a presuppositional partial identity function on entities: it
asserts nothing and is defined on a domain, so it denotes that domain, a `Set` of entities. A
bundle denotes the intersection of its features' domains (`Finset.inf`) and the empty bundle
everything, so over well-formed bundles the domains nest by specification
(`IsLowerSet.inf_le_inf_of_card_le`), the Feature-Subset Principle as a consequence of the
privative geometry. Person is read at parthood of the agent and the addressee of the context of
utterance, number at atomicity, and gender at the gender a referent is socially assigned
(`Gendered`). For gender Sauerland makes masculine the unmarked value, the one coordinations of
mixed gender take, with feminine presupposing non-masculinity and neuter genderlessness, so the
neuter domain lies inside the feminine one. The person domains are the participant-set extents
of `Person.Bears` pulled back along the participants of a referent, and a tripartition value
denotes the referents in its domain and in no stronger one.

## Main definitions

* `Person.dom`, `Number.dom`, `Gender.dom`: the domain of an optional value.
* `Reference.Context.participants`: the discourse roles whose holders are part of a referent.

## Main results

* `Person.mem_dom_feature_iff`: a person feature's domain is the pullback of `Person.Bears`.
* `Person.participants_mem_participantSets_first`, `…_second`, `…_third`: the tripartition
  values denote the referents in their domain and in no stronger one.
* `Gender.dom_neuter_subset_dom_feminine`: the neuter domain lies inside the feminine one.

## Implementation notes

An absent feature, and a value without a bundle, the impersonal person, the numbers beyond the
dual and the non-sex-based genders, denote the whole domain; the semantically unmarked values,
third person, plural and masculine, are the empty bundles, whose unrestricted domain Wang finds
recruited by honorification. A referent may be gendered neither way, and then only a form without
a gender feature is defined of it, the account of singular *they* of Bjorkman and of Konnelly and
Cowper. The person entries take the agent and the addressee as parts of the referent where
Sauerland has them overlap it; the two coincide for an atomic agent and addressee. The
two-feature decomposition does not see clusivity, so the inclusive is refined to referents
including the addressee. The cells of the tripartition are stated one by one, since
Maximize Presupposition (`Alternatives.useCondition`) yields them only when the agent is not
part of the addressee; otherwise the first and second person domains coincide
(`Sauerland2003.useCondition_second_of_degenerate`). The dual's minimality domain needs a
mereological predicate the entity domain's order does not supply, so the dual restricts nothing.
