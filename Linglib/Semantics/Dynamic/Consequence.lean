# Consequence in dynamic semantics

A dynamic meaning is an update of information states, and a state accepts a sentence when
updating it with the sentence changes nothing, that is, when the state is a fixed point of the
update. A text updates a state sentence by sentence. [veltman-1996] distinguishes three
consequence relations between the premises of an argument and its conclusion: updating the
minimal state with the premises yields a state that accepts the conclusion (his validity₁,
`EntailsFrom ⊤`), updating any state does (validity₂, `Entails`), or every state that accepts
each premise accepts the conclusion (validity₃, `PreservesAcceptance`), which is the shape of
[yalcin-2007]'s informational consequence.

An update is additive when it meets its input with the result of updating the minimal state, so
that a static content fixes its dynamic meaning. The additive updates are exactly those
satisfying Veltman's four constraints, Strengthening, Monotony, Idempotence and Persistence,
which read in the reversed order make the update a principal closure operator. For additive
updates the three consequence relations coincide, each saying that the contents of the premises
jointly entail the content of the conclusion. In general they come apart: acceptance
preservation is monotone in the premises and entailment is monotone on the left, while
entailment from a fixed state is neither, but inserting a conclusion that it draws into the
premises changes nothing, which gives Sequential Monotony and Sequential Cut.

On sets of possibilities the additive updates are the classical ones of
`Semantics/Dynamic/Update.lean`, the static updates `CCP.up`, and entailment between static
updates is inclusion of their contents. An update with an effect, such as a partial update, is a
Kleisli arrow, and its extension along the monad's bind is an update of the kind treated here: a
state accepts the arrow exactly when the arrow returns it unchanged.

## Main definitions

* `DynamicSemantics.text`: the update of a state with a list of sentences, from the left.
* `DynamicSemantics.EntailsFrom`, `DynamicSemantics.Entails`,
  `DynamicSemantics.PreservesAcceptance`: the three consequence relations, with the scoped
  notation `ψs ⊩₁ φ`, `ψs ⊩₂ φ` and `ψs ⊩₃ φ`.
* `DynamicSemantics.IsAdditive`: the update meets its input with a fixed content.

## Main results

* `DynamicSemantics.isAdditive_iff`: additivity is Strengthening, Monotony, Idempotence and
  Persistence together.
* `DynamicSemantics.tfae_entails`: for additive updates the three consequence relations
  coincide.
* `DynamicSemantics.EntailsFrom.insert_iff`: Sequential Monotony and Sequential Cut.
* `DynamicSemantics.entailsFrom_append_self`: under Idempotence entailment is reflexive.
* `DynamicSemantics.isFixedPt_text_iff`: along updates that never add possibilities, a state
  accepts a text exactly when it accepts each of its sentences.
* `DynamicSemantics.CCP.isAdditive_iff_isClassical`, `DynamicSemantics.CCP.entails_up_iff`: on
  sets of possibilities the additive updates are the classical ones, and entailment between
  static updates is inclusion.
* `DynamicSemantics.Update.entails_image_test_iff`: a relational update entails a test exactly
  when its outputs satisfy the test's condition.
* `DynamicSemantics.isFixedPt_bind_pure_iff`: acceptance of a Kleisli arrow.

## Implementation notes

States are ordered by inclusion, as for `DynamicSemantics.CCP` and `DynamicSemantics.ExpState`:
a more informed state lies lower, the minimal state is `⊤`, and Strengthening says that an update
never adds possibilities. Veltman orients the order the other way, with the minimal state `0` at
the bottom and the sum of two states their join, and the content is the same; on `Set` the
reversed orientation would make `⊥` the absurd state `∅` rather than the minimal one. Acceptance
is `Function.IsFixedPt`, and a sentence is identified with its update.
