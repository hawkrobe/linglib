# Accessibility of discourse referents

A discourse referent is accessible from a condition when it is declared in a box that is
accessible where the condition occurs: the box containing the condition, the boxes it is
nested in, and the antecedent of a conditional for its consequent ([kamp-reyle-1993],
Def. 1.4.11, Def. 2.1.3, Def. 2.4.4). Accessibility is a property of occurrences: one box can
occur twice in a DRS, at places with different accessible boxes. An occurrence is reached from
the host by a walk that steps into the sub-boxes of complex conditions, collecting the boxes
accessible at each step, and the walk is computed by a structural recursion that decides
accessibility.

## Main definitions

* `DRT.ScopeStep`, `DRT.Occurrence`: a step into a sub-box, collecting the accessible boxes,
  and the occurrences of boxes in a host.
* `DRT.AccessibleFrom`: a referent accessible from a condition (Def. 1.4.11).
* `DRT.DRS.Accessible`: a referent accessible where another is declared.
* `DRT.AccessibleTo`: a box accessible to another ([geurts-beaver-maier-2024]).

## Main statements

* `DRT.DRS.mem_occurrences_iff`: the computed occurrences are exactly those reached by the walk,
  so `DRS.Accessible` is decidable.

## Implementation notes

Kamp and Reyle state Def. 2.1.3 and Def. 2.4.4 for DRS values. Read on values, they let a chain
pass through a second occurrence of an equal box and make a referent accessible where no
occurrence of the condition sees it, so the definitions here quantify over occurrences.
