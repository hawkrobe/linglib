# Model-theoretic semantics of DRSs
[kamp-reyle-1993]

DRS truth via *verifying embeddings* into a mathlib `FirstOrder.Language.Structure`
— Kamp & Reyle's Def. 1.4.4–1.4.5 in the *total-assignment* rendering. An
embedding is an assignment `v : V → M` of discourse referents to the model
domain; the discourse referents introduced by a sub-DRS are existentially
(re)assigned when that sub-DRS is entered, which is what
`(∀ x ∉ K.referents, v' x = v x)` expresses (`v'` extends `v` on `K`'s universe).

**Deviation** ([muskens-1996], fn. 4): K&R's embeddings are *partial* functions
that sub-DRSs strictly *extend*, so a re-declared referent keeps its value; here
embeddings are total and a re-declared referent is freely reassigned. The two
agree on DRSs that declare each referent once — the construction algorithm never
re-declares — but diverge on re-declaration: `[ | [x | man x] ⇒ [x | mortal x]]`
says "every man is mortal" for K&R, "if there is a man there is a mortal" here.

## Main declarations

* `DRS.Realize` / `Condition.Realize` — the verifying-embedding relation
  (Def. 1.4.4), reusing mathlib's `Structure.RelMap` for atomic conditions.
* `DRS.trueIn` — `K` is true in `M` iff some embedding verifies it (Def. 1.4.5).

A sub-DRS `K` is entered by existentially (re)assigning the referents of its
universe (`v'` agrees with `v` off `K.referents`). For `imp`, the consequent
witness `v''` extends the *antecedent* assignment `v'` (not the host `v`):
antecedent referents are visible in the consequent — the `⇒` accessibility
asymmetry. -/
