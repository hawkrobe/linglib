# Information states

An *information state* is a set of world–assignment pairs with the
assignments partial ([kamp-vangenabith-reyle-2011], Def. 0.23;
partiality by `Part`, after [elliott-sudo-2025], Def. 3.1). `State`
carries *informativeness* (Def. 0.25) as its preorder, lifted along the
upper closure of the point set: `s ≤ s'` iff every point of the
stronger state lies above a point of the weaker. The initial state is
`⊥`, the absurd state is `⊤ = ∅`, and consistent merge (Def. 0.26) is
the monoid multiplication and the least upper bound.

Def. 0.23's base `X` is not a component: `State.UniformAt X` carves it
out as a stratum, whose states are sets of world–`X`-assignment pairs
(`State.uniformEquiv`). *Subsistence* ([elliott-sudo-2025], Def. 3.3,
after [groenendijk-stokhof-veltman-1996] Defs. 2.8–2.9) is not a new
relation: a point subsists in a state iff it lies in `lowerClosure` of
its point set, a state subsists in another iff the lower closures are
ordered — the dual closure kernel. On a uniform stratum both kernels
are partial orders, coinciding with `⊇` and `⊆`.

## Main definitions

- `State`: information states, preordered by informativeness; `⊥` is
  the initial state (Def. 0.23's Λ), `⊤ = ∅` the absurd state.
- the `CommMonoid` instance: `*` is consistent merge (Def. 0.26,
  binary, as `Set.lubs`) and `1 = ⊥`, so `Multiset.prod` is the finite
  n-ary merge.
- `State.UniformAt`, `State.restrict`: the base-`X` stratum; domain
  restriction.
- `Familiar`, `State.randomAssign`: familiarity and random assignment
  ([elliott-sudo-2025]); worldly content (Def. 0.23(v)'s proposition,
  [elliott-sudo-2025]'s 𝒲) is the image `Possibility.world '' s`.

## Main results

- `State.isLUB_mul`, `State.isGLB_union`: merge is the least upper
  bound and union the greatest lower bound — with the `CommMonoid` and
  `CovariantClass` instances, the content half of
  [visser-vermeulen-1996]'s monoidal processing.
- `State.le_iff_superset`, `State.lowerClosure_le_iff`,
  `State.mul_eq_inter_of_uniform`: on a uniform stratum the orders
  are `⊇`/`⊆` and merge is intersection.
- `State.antisymmetrizationOrderIso`: up to informational equivalence,
  states are the complete lattice of upper sets of possibilities.
- `State.uniformEquiv`: uniform states at `X` are `Set (W × (X → M))`.

## Implementation notes

`State` is a type synonym for the point-set, in the `Lex`/`OrderDual`
mold: membership and the set operations are re-exposed, while `≤` is
informativeness — the kernel of `upperClosure` — rather than `⊆`, which
remains available with its literal meaning. Neither closure kernel is
antisymmetric on point sets (adding a comparable point is invisible),
so `State` is a `Preorder` only; antisymmetry holds on each uniform
stratum.
