# File change semantics

This file defines file change potentials, the meanings of sentences in Heim's file change
semantics. A file records what a discourse has established so far: it keeps a card for each
individual that has been mentioned, and a sequence of individuals satisfies the file when,
read card by card, it fits every entry. Uttering a sentence changes the file. It filters out
the sequences the sentence rules out and opens a card for each individual the sentence
introduces, and the meaning of the sentence is the function from files to files that its
utterance brings about.

A file is an information state (`State`) whose points are the sequences and whose
established cards are the referents every point defines. The dissertation's files, which
distinguish only finitely many cards, are the states uniform at a set of cards. A file change
potential is a partial function on states. It is undefined at a file that fails the
sentence's felicity conditions, so presupposition is definedness: the Novelty Condition on an
indefinite requires its card to be new to the file, and the Familiarity Condition on a
definite requires the card to be present. Sequencing is composition of partial functions.

The assertive update by an atomic sentence merges the file with the sentence's proposition
state. At the cards the file already has the merge filters the sequences, and at new cards it
extends each sequence by every value, which is Heim's atomic rule read point by point. Every
update only adds information, so it is eliminative in the informativeness order, Heim's
Principle (A) as `PartialUpdate.IsEliminative`, and a card, once established, is never lost.
Negation keeps the sequences that no extension carries into the scope's update, which traps the
referents introduced inside the scope. On a uniform file negation is set difference, as in the
later propositional presentation of the theory.

## Main definitions

* `FCP`: file change potentials, partial updates of information states.
* `FCP.ofState`: the assertive update by a state, merging the file with it.
* `FCP.atomVar`: the update by an atomic predicate at a card.
* `FCP.atomW`: the update by an atomic predicate on the world alone.
* `FCP.neg`, `FCP.cond`: negation as non-subsistence, and the conditional as `¬(φ ∧ ¬ψ)`.
* `FCP.indef`: the indefinite, guarded by the Novelty Condition.
* `FCP.def_`: the definite, guarded by the Familiarity Condition and its descriptive content.
* `FCP.trueIn`: truth of a sentence with respect to a file, as consistency of the updated file.

## Main results

* `FCP.ofState_mul`: updating by two states in sequence is updating by their merge.
* `FCP.semiconj_ofState`: up to informational equivalence, assertion is additive.
* `FCP.atomVar_eq`: the atom extends the file along its card and filters by its predicate.
* `FCP.atomVar_eq_of_familiar`, `FCP.atomVar_eq_of_novel`: at an established card the atom
  filters, and at a new card it is random assignment followed by filtering.
* `FCP.admits_indef`, `FCP.admits_def_`: the felicity conditions are definedness.
* `FCP.isEliminative_ofState`, `FCP.isEliminative_neg`, `PartialUpdate.IsEliminative.indef`: every
  clause only adds information.
* `PartialUpdate.IsEliminative.familiar`: an established card stays established.
* `FCP.neg_eq_partial_neg`: on a uniform file, negation is set difference.

/-- A file change potential ([heim-1982]): a partial update of referential
information states. Partiality is presupposition (`PartialUpdate.admits`); Heim numbers her
cards, `V := ℕ`. -/

/-! ### Assertive update -/

/-- Assertive update by a state: the file merges with it. Each point of the
file pairs with every compatible point of `A`, filtering where their domains
overlap and extending where `A` defines more. The update is total;
appropriateness lives on `indef` and `def_`. -/

/-- Updating by the initial state changes nothing. -/
theorem ofState_one : ofState (1 : State W V M) = PFun.id _ := funext fun _ ↦ by simp

/-- Assertive update is the regular action of the merge monoid: updating by

  funext fun _ ↦ by simp [PartialUpdate.seq, PFun.comp_apply, mul_assoc]

/-- Principle (A) at an assertive update: merging only adds information. -/
theorem ofState_le (h : F' ∈ ofState A F) : F' ≤ F := mem_ofState.mp h ▸ State.mul_le_left

/-- Up to informational equivalence, assertion is additive in the sense of
`Semantics/Dynamic/Consequence.lean`: on the upper sets of possibilities it meets the file with
the content of `A` (`isAdditive_inf_right`). Merging need not be literally idempotent, since two
compatible points of a file merge into a third, so literal fixed points of assertion are finer
than informational acceptance. -/

/-! ### Connectives and felicity conditions -/

/-- Negation keeps the points of `F` that do not subsist in the scope's
update: no extension of the point verifies the scope, so referents
introduced inside it are trapped. Undefined when the scope is. -/
def neg (φ : FCP W V M) : FCP W V M :=
  fun F : State W V M ↦ (φ F).map fun F' ↦ {p ∈ F | p ∉ lowerClosure F'}

/-- The conditional is the negated conjunction `¬(φ ∧ ¬ψ)`. -/

/-- An indefinite at card `x`: defined only if `x` is novel (the Novelty
Condition), then random assignment at `x` followed by the body. Indefinites
do not quantify; they open a card. [heim-1991] later derives novelty from
Maximize Presupposition rather than stipulating it. -/

  fun F : State W V M ↦ Part.assert (State.Novel F x) fun _ ↦ body (F.randomAssign x)

/-! ### Principle (A)

Every defined update only adds information: it descends in informativeness. On a uniform stratum
this is set shrinking (`State.UniformAt.le_iff_subset`); at a novel card an update extends rather
than shrinks. -/

/-! ### Truth -/

/-- The truth criterion (C): `φ` is true with respect to `F` iff `F + φ` is
defined and consistent. Existential quantification is built into truth, so
indefinites need no existential closure. -/
def trueIn (F : State W V M) (φ : FCP W V M) : Prop := ∃ F' ∈ φ F, F'.Nonempty

/-- Truth implies definedness. -/

  ⟨F, hsup, hcons⟩

/-! ### The uniform shadow -/

/-- On a uniform stratum, non-subsistence negation is [heim-1983]'s
set-difference negation (`CCP.Partial.neg`): with every referent shared, a
point subsists in the update exactly when it survives into it. -/
