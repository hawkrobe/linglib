# Noun coercion licensed by non-vacuity

Kamp and Partee's non-vacuity principle asks that a predicate have both a positive and a
negative extension in its local domain, and their head primacy principle makes the extension of
the head noun the local domain of its modifier. A privative adjective is never non-vacuous within
its head, and neither is a tautologous one such as *real*. Partee's proposal is that the head is
then shifted, as a last resort, to include the adjective's value, *fur* to real or fake fur, so
that the compound becomes non-vacuous.

## Main definitions

* `Semantics.Property.IsNonVacuous P w d`: `P` has a positive and a negative extension within `d` at
  `w`.
* `Semantics.Property.ShiftsHead adj N w`: `adj N` is vacuous within `N` and non-vacuous within `N`
  widened by the adjective's value, so Partee's rule shifts the head.

## Main statements

* `Semantics.Property.not_isNonVacuous_of_isPrivative`, `not_isNonVacuous_self`: privative and
  tautologous modifiers are vacuous within their head.
* `Semantics.Property.shiftsHead_iff_of_isPrivative`: a privative adjective shifts its head exactly
  when there are both things in its value and things in the noun.
* `Semantics.Property.not_shiftsHead_of_isNonVacuous`: a compound already non-vacuous within its
  head is not shifted.

## Implementation notes

The principles are Kamp and Partee's (NVP) and (HPP), Partee's (18) and (20), with head primacy
in its simplest form, which makes the local domain the positive extension of the head.
`IsNonVacuous` is bivalent, simplifying the partial setting of Kamp and Partee. Complement
coercion (`Studies/Pustejovsky1995.lean`) and the type shifts of noun phrases
(`Semantics/Quantification/NP.lean`) are different notions.
