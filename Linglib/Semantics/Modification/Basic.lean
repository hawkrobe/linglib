# Modifiers

A modifier of `τ` is a function from `τ` to itself, as Parsons treats adjectives and adverbs as
functions on the predicates they modify; adjectives, adverbs and relative clauses are modifiers
of different types `τ`, and modifiers stack by composition. Kamp's classification of adjective
meanings is order-theoretic: over an ordered type, a modifier is subsective when it maps each
argument below itself, privative when its value is disjoint from its argument, and intersective
when it is the meet with a fixed element. Its order dual, a modifier mapping each argument above
itself, is extensive.

A modifier of sets can act pointwise, sending a set to the union of the values of a map on its
members, which is `SetRel.image`. The modifiers of numerals and of scalar alternatives are of this
kind, and Kamp's classes then read off the map: extensive when every point is in its own value,
subsective when no value leaves its point, and privative only for the empty map, while being
disjoint from every singleton argument is irreflexivity.

`Semantics/Modification/Classification.lean` specializes the classes to intensional properties.

## Main definitions

* `Modifier τ`: the functions from `τ` to `τ`.
* `Modifier.intersective q`: the meet with `q`.
* `Modifier.IsSubsective`, `IsPrivative`, `IsIntersective`: Kamp's classes, and
  `Modifier.IsExtensive`, the dual of subsective.
* `Modifier.pointwise r`: the modifier of sets acting pointwise through `r`.

## Main results

* `Modifier.isExtensive_pointwise_iff`, `isSubsective_pointwise_iff`: the classes of a
  pointwise modifier, read off its map.
* `Modifier.isPrivative_pointwise_iff`: a pointwise modifier is privative only when its
  map is empty everywhere.
