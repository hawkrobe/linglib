# Modifiers
@cite{parsons-1970} @cite{kamp-1975}

A **modifier** of `τ` is a function on the modificand's denotation
(@cite{parsons-1970}: "modifiers as functions on predicates"). Adjectives,
adverbs, and relative clauses are all modifiers — of *different* `τ` (nominal
`e ⇒ t`, event `Event → Prop`, …) — unified by *being* this type, not by
implementing an interface.

The well-behaved special case is **intersective** modification: conjunction with a
fixed property (`λx. P x ∧ Q x`), on which restrictive relative clauses,
intersective adjectives, and manner adverbs all converge.

## Main declarations

* `Modifier` — a modifier of `τ` is an endofunction `τ → τ`.
* `Modifier.intersective` — the intersective modifier built from a property `P`.
* `Modifier.isIntersective` / `.isSubsective` / `.isPrivative` — the
  @cite{kamp-1975} modifier-meaning classification, as predicates on a modifier.

## Implementation notes

`Modifier.intersective` is the canonical intersective-modification operation; the
concrete reflexes reduce to it (`ArgumentStructure/LF.EventModifier.modify` over
events calls it; the type-driven interpreter's Predicate Modification step is it at
`e ⇒ t`). The adjective-specific classification in `Gradability/Classification`
(over `AdjMeaning`) is the remaining copy to fold onto these forms (follow-up).
