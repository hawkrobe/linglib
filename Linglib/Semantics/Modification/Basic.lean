# Modifiers
[parsons-1970] [kamp-1975]

A **modifier** of `τ` is a function on the modificand's denotation
([parsons-1970]: modifiers as functions on predicates). Adjectives,
adverbs, and relative clauses are all modifiers — of *different* `τ` (nominal
`e ⇒ t`, event `Event → Prop`, …) — unified by *being* this type, not by
implementing an interface.

The [kamp-1975] meaning-postulate classification is order-theoretic and is
stated here at that generality: over an ordered carrier, **subsective**
modifiers are deflationary (`m x ≤ x`), **privative** modifiers have output
disjoint from the modificand, and **intersective** modifiers are
meet-translations (`m x = q ⊓ x`; at `α → Prop`, pointwise conjunction).
The intensional hierarchy (`Modification/Classification.lean`) and its
single-world specializations (`Studies/Kamp1975.lean` § 1) are these
classes at the carriers `W → E → Prop` and `E → Prop`.

## Main declarations

* `Modifier` — a modifier of `τ` is an endofunction `τ → τ`.
* `Modifier.intersective` — the intersective modifier built from `q`: meet
  the modificand with `q`.
* `Modifier.isIntersective` / `.isSubsective` / `.isPrivative` — the
  [kamp-1975] classification over an ordered carrier.

    of different `τ`; they compose as endofunctions (modifier stacking). -/
