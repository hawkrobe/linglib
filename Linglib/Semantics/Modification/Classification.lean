# Modifier-meaning classification at the intensional carrier

We instantiate the order-theoretic modifier classes of
`Modification/Basic.lean` (`Modifier.isIntersective`, `.isSubsective`,
`.isPrivative`) at intensional properties, providing their pointwise
unfolding lemmas, the implication structure, and [partee-2010]'s
post-collapse three-class hierarchy.

The classification descends from the operator treatment of modifiers
introduced independently by [parsons-1970] (intersective = his
"predicative", subsective = his "standard") and [kamp-1975], and was
consolidated in [kamp-partee-1995]; the class labels are Partee's.
Extensionality — dependence on the noun's extension at each world — is
the orthogonal, cross-cutting dimension, not a rung of the entailment
hierarchy: it is `Intensional.IsExtensional` at this carrier, and
`Studies/Kamp1975.lean` § 4 witnesses its independence from
subsectivity. Whether *adjectives* uniformly denote
`Modifier (Property W E)` is itself a theoretical claim
(`Studies/Elbourne2026.lean`); the carrier is named for the denotation
type, not the word class.

## Main definitions

* `Property W E`: intensional properties, `Intensional.Intension W (E → Prop)`.
* `isIntersective_iff`, `isPrivative_iff`: pointwise forms of the
  order-theoretic classes at this carrier ("gray"/"French" vs
  "fake"/"counterfeit"; subsective "skillful" needs no unfolding lemma —
  `Modifier.isSubsective` is already pointwise here).
* `isExtensional_of_isIntersective`: intersective modifier meanings are
  `Intensional.IsExtensional`.
* `not_isSubsective_of_isPrivative`: privative meanings with non-empty
  extension are not subsective (intersective → subsective holds at any
  carrier: `Modifier.isIntersective.isSubsective`).
* `RevisedClass`: [partee-2010]'s three-class hierarchy after the
  privative collapse, interpreted by `RevisedClass.satisfies`.

variable {W E : Type*} {adj : Modifier (Property W E)}

/-- Pointwise form of `Modifier.isIntersective` at the intensional
    carrier: the extension at each world is the intersection of the
    noun's extension with some fixed property Q.

    Examples: "gray", "French", "carnivorous", "four-legged". -/
theorem isIntersective_iff :
    isIntersective adj ↔

        adj N w x ↔ (Q w x ∧ N w x) := by
  simp only [isIntersective, funext_iff, Pi.inf_apply, inf_Prop_eq, eq_iff_iff]

/-- Pointwise form of `Modifier.isPrivative` at the intensional carrier:
    the extension is always disjoint from the noun's extension.

    Examples: "fake", "counterfeit".

/-! ### Implication structure

    Intersective → subsective holds at any carrier
    (`Modifier.isIntersective.isSubsective`); intersective → extensional
    and the privative/subsective incompatibility are stated here. The
    order-theoretic core of the latter is `Modifier.isPrivative.eq_bot`. -/

/-- Intersective modifier meanings are extensional: meet with a fixed
    property reads the noun only through its extension at each world. -/

    Intensional.IsExtensional adj := by
  obtain ⟨Q, hQ⟩ := h

/-- Privative modifier meanings are not subsective (when the modifier has
    non-empty extension for some noun). -/

/-! ### Revised hierarchy ([partee-2010])

The post-collapse 3-class hierarchy after eliminating "privative" via
noun coercion. Per [partee-2010] footnote 1, the hierarchy is
subset-ordered (intersective ⊂ subsective ⊂ unrestricted), not linear;
the enum picks the *narrowest fit* per adjective. The licensing
mechanism (NVP + HPP) is in
`Semantics/Modification/Coercion.lean`. -/

section Revised

/-- Adjective hierarchy after [partee-2010]'s collapse: the
    privative class is eliminated in favor of subsective + noun coercion. -/

  /-- `⟦A N⟧ = ⟦Q⟧ ∩ ⟦N⟧` (Kamp's intersective). -/
  | intersective
  /-- `⟦A N⟧ ⊆ ⟦N*⟧` — includes former "privatives" via coercion. -/
  | subsective
  /-- No entailment: alleged, potential, putative (the plain/modal
      non-subsective class). -/
  | nonSubsective
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- Predicate-level interpretation of `RevisedClass`. Per the subset
    ordering, `intersective` and `subsective` are not disjoint: every
    intersective modifier meaning satisfies `Modifier.isSubsective`
    (`Modifier.isIntersective.isSubsective`).

    Caveat on `.nonSubsective`: the membership condition `¬ isSubsective
    adj` is necessary but coarse — it also holds of Kamp-privatives,
    which under Partee's reanalysis are not supposed to exist as a
    natural class. Read `.nonSubsective` as Partee's *intended* "modal"
    class (alleged, potential, putative); the bare predicate
    `¬ isSubsective` over-generates. -/
