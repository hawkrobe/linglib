# Scalar telicity: telicity from the order structure of a scale

[kennedy-levin-2008]'s thesis — a degree achievement's telicity is fixed by the
boundedness of its adjectival scale — realised *order-theoretically* and connected
to [beavers-2011]'s affectedness hierarchy. "The scale has a greatest degree" is
mathlib's `OrderTop` mixin; "the scale is unbounded above" is `NoMaxOrder`; over a
degree type `δ`. A degree achievement is telic (admits a Quantized witness) **iff**
its scale has a greatest element — the witness is the maximum `g_φ = ⊤`, *derived*
from the mixin, not stipulated from a stored flag.

The measure is the patient's degree at the event's end (its temporal trace);
[beavers-2011]'s `HasScalarResult` is synthesised by `ofHasMeasureFunction`.

## Main results

* `telic_of_orderTop` — `[OrderTop δ]` ⇒ a Quantized witness exists (at `⊤`).
* `atelic_of_noMaxOrder` — `[NoMaxOrder δ]` ⇒ no Quantized witness exists.
* `Dimension` / `Dimension.degree` — a scalar dimension is the categorical
  primitive (what the adjective measures); its boundedness is the order-mixin
  profile of its degree type, not a stored flag.

## Implementation notes

Degree carriers are computable order-shapes (`WithTop ℕ` for closed, `ℕ` for
unbounded-above), so `decide` stays available; what matters is the
presence/absence of the `OrderTop` / `NoMaxOrder` mixin, not the carrier.

/-! ### Dimensions: boundedness as the order structure of the degree type

`Dimension` (in `Semantics/Aspect/Dimension.lean`) is the categorical primitive a
fragment stores. Its boundedness is *not* stored: each dimension has a degree type
(`Dimension.degree`) whose order-mixin profile determines it, and
`hasGreatest_degree_iff_closed` grounds the derived `Dimension.boundedness` view to
that order structure. -/

open Core.Order (Boundedness)
open Semantics.Degree (HasGreatest hasGreatest_of_orderTop not_hasGreatest_of_noMaxOrder)
/-- The degree type for each dimension. Boundedness is structural: closed
    dimensions carry `OrderTop` (`WithTop ℕ`), unbounded-above ones `NoMaxOrder`
    (`ℕ`). The carrier is a computable order-shape, not a real magnitude — only the
    mixin matters. -/
abbrev Dimension.degree : Dimension → Type

  | .cracking | .denting | .scratching | .boiling => WithTop ℕ
  | .length | .width | .temperature | .corrosion | .quantity
  | .unspecified => ℕ

instance (d : Dimension) : LinearOrder d.degree := by cases d <;> exact inferInstance

/-- **Grounding.** The derived `Dimension.boundedness` view agrees with the order
    structure: a dimension is closed exactly when its degree type has a greatest
    element. So `boundedness` is not a free-standing table — it tracks `OrderTop` /
    `NoMaxOrder` on `Dimension.degree`. -/
theorem hasGreatest_degree_iff_closed (d : Dimension) :
    HasGreatest d.degree ↔ d.boundedness = .closed := by
  cases d

      exact iff_of_false not_hasGreatest_of_noMaxOrder (by decide)

/-- **The Kennedy–Levin thesis, as a theorem.** The computable
    `Dimension.defaultTelicity` table is exactly the order-theoretic fact: a
    dimension is telic iff its degree type has a greatest element (`OrderTop`). So
    the telicity a fragment consumes is grounded in the scale's order structure,
    not stipulated. -/
