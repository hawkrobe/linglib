# Viewpoint aspect

This file defines viewpoint aspect, which in Smith's theory, following Klein, relates the topic
time to the situation time. A relation between the reference time and the run time of an event
gives an operator from event predicates to interval properties, at each world a set of reference
intervals, and the operator of a viewpoint is that of its relation; the imperfective, perfective
and prospective operators of Knick and Sharf are instances. The perfect takes an interval
property to a set of world-time points through a perfect time span, which a perfect-level
adverbial in the sense of Iatridou, Anagnostopoulou and Izvorski restricts. An interval adverbial
is read durative, the predicate holding at every subinterval of its interval, or inclusive, at
some subinterval, as Dowty, Mittwoch and Vlach distinguish them.

## Main definitions

* `Aspect.ofRel`: the operator of a relation between reference time and run time.
* `Aspect.IMPF`: the imperfective.
* `Aspect.PRFV`: the perfective.
* `Aspect.UNBOUNDED`: Pancheva's non-strict imperfective.
* `Aspect.perfect`: the perfect as an operator on interval properties, whose reference interval
  is a final subinterval of the perfect time span; `Aspect.PERF` is its value at a point.
* `Aspect.PERF_XN`: the perfect with a left boundary drawn from a domain restriction.
* `Aspect.PERF_ADV`: the perfect over the spans a perfect-level adverbial admits.
* `Aspect.durative`, `Aspect.inclusive`: the durative and inclusive readings of an interval
  adverbial.

## Main results

* `Aspect.prfv_eq_upperClosure`: the perfective holds on the upper closure of the predicate's
  run times.
* `Aspect.unbounded_eq_lowerClosure`: the non-strict imperfective holds on their lower closure.
* `Aspect.inclusive_eq_upperClosure`: the inclusive reading is the upper closure.
* `Aspect.mem_perf_adv_iff_mem_perf_xn_image`: at a fixed right boundary an adverbial is a
  domain restriction on the left boundary.

## Implementation notes

* Of Klein's relations, TT INCL TSit is the imperfective, TT AT TSit the perfective, TT AFTER
  TSit the perfect and TT BEFORE TSit the prospective. Smith's neutral viewpoint includes the
  initial point of the situation and at least one internal stage.
* The operators follow Knick and Sharf's equations, with a boundary a time point where the
  paper has a final or initial subinterval. The predicate applies to the outer reference time,
  which beneath the perfect is the perfect time span.
* A perfect-level adverbial is a predicate on spans: *since t₀* is `LB t₀`, and the covert
  adverbial of an unmodified perfect is `⊤`.
* Event predicates range over any event domain with a temporal trace (`Event.TemporalTrace`).
* An interval property is a family of sets of intervals indexed by worlds,
  `W → Set (NonemptyInterval T)`, so that mathlib's order closures and lower and upper sets apply
  to it directly; the perfect yields a set of world-time points.
