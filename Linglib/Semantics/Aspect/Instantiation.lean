# Instantiation of sorted properties

This file defines the instantiation of a sorted property at a reference interval. An event
property is instantiated when the run time of one of its events lies in the interval, a state
property when the run time of one of its states overlaps it, as in the discourse
representation analyses of Kamp and Rohrer, Partee, and Kamp and Reyle, and a property of times
when it holds of the interval. Reference intervals are `Interval (WithTop T)`, so an interval
may run to the end of time and the null interval is `⊥`.

## Main definitions

* `Aspect.SortedProperty`: a property of events, of states, or of times.
* `Aspect.At`: the instantiation relation `AT(t, w, P)`.

## Main results

* `Aspect.At.mono`: instantiation of an eventuality is monotone in the interval.
* `Aspect.at_Ici_eventive_iff`: an event property is instantiated at a ray when an event starts
  no earlier than it.
* `Aspect.at_Ici_stative_iff`: a state property is instantiated at a ray when a state persists
  to it.
* `Aspect.at_eventive_withTop_iff_prfv`: on a bounded interval, eventive instantiation is
  Klein's perfective `PRFV`.
