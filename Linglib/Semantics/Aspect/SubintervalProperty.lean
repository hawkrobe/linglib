# The subinterval property

This file defines the subinterval property of Bennett and Partee and of Dowty. A predicate of
events has it when every subinterval of the run time of an event it holds of is the run time of
an event it holds of, which is to say that its run times form a lower set. States and activities
have the property: if John slept from one to three, he slept from one to two. Accomplishments and
achievements lack it, since no proper part of the building of a house is the building of a house.
The property draws only this line, and does not separate states from activities or
accomplishments from achievements.

For a predicate with the property the imperfective entails the perfective at the same reference
time, *Mary was running* entailing *Mary ran*: the reference time lies inside the run time of a
running, so it is itself the run time of a running. The entailment does not characterize the
property, since a predicate may validate it without being closed under subintervals.

Dowty states the property of sentences true at intervals. For an interval property, a set of
intervals at each world, it says that the set is a lower set, mathlib's `IsLowerSet`, so it needs
no name of its own. The non-strict and the strict imperfective have it whatever the predicate,
and so does the negated perfective, the complement of an upper set: an interval containing no
event of the predicate has no subinterval containing one. A durative claim, the predicate at
every subinterval of a span, has it too, and for a lower set the durative claim and the perfect
are the set itself.

## Main definitions

* `Aspect.HasSubintervalProperty`: the run times of the predicate form a lower set at every
  world.

## Main results

* `Aspect.hasSubintervalProperty_iff_witnesses`: every subinterval of the run time of an event of
  the predicate is the run time of an event of the predicate.
* `Aspect.HasSubintervalProperty.impf_subset_prfv`: the imperfective entails the perfective.
* `Aspect.not_hasSubintervalProperty_snd_eq`: the predicate of events that end when a durative
  event ends lacks the property.
* `Aspect.exists_prfv_of_impf_not_hasSubintervalProperty`: a predicate may validate the
  entailment and lack the property.
* `Aspect.isLowerSet_impf`, `Aspect.isLowerSet_compl_prfv`: the imperfective and the negated
  perfective have the property as interval properties, as the non-strict imperfective does
  (`Aspect.isLowerSet_unbounded`).
* `Aspect.durative_eq_of_isLowerSet`, `Aspect.perfect_eq_of_isLowerSet`: for an interval property
  with the property, the durative claim and the perfect are the property itself.

## Implementation notes

The property is divisive reference, `Mereology.DIV`, of the predicate's run times, so it is
stated on mathlib's `IsLowerSet`. The viewpoint operators quantify over events of the world of
evaluation, so the entailment is the extensional one. The imperfective paradox proper, on which
*John was building a house* is true though no house is ever built, needs a modal progressive
and is not modelled.
