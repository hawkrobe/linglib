# Telicity

This file defines telicity as a property of event predicates and derives it from the thematic
relation between an object and an event, following Krifka. A predicate is telic when every part
of one of its events that it also applies to is both an initial and a final part of that event,
so that no event of the predicate has a proper part of the predicate that starts later or ends
earlier. Quantized predicates are telic, though not conversely, and a cumulative predicate that
applies to two events one after the other is not.

Telicity originates in the thematic relation. A relation is strictly incremental when the parts
of the object and the parts of the event correspond one to one, as for the object of *eat* or
*draw*, and incremental when it is the closure of such a relation under sums, which admits the
backups of *read the article*. The verb phrase of a relation and an object predicate is the
existential closure over the object, and the reference properties of the object carry over to
it: cumulativity along a summative relation, so *eat apples* is cumulative, and quantization
along a relation with uniqueness of participants and mapping to subobjects, so *eat two apples*
is quantized.

Accounts differ on which structural property the label `Aspect.Telicity` names: the initial
and final part property here, quantization, or the failure of the subinterval property
(`Semantics/Aspect/SubintervalProperty.lean`). The theorems of this file relate the first two.

## Main definitions

* `IsTelic` — every part of an event of the predicate that the predicate applies to is an
  initial and a final part of it.
* `SINC`, `INC` — strict incrementality and incrementality of a thematic relation.
* `Incrementality.Holds` — the property an incrementality class of `Aspect/Defs.lean` names.
* `VP` — the verb phrase of a relation and an object predicate.

## Main results

* `isTelic_of_qua`, `exists_isTelic_not_qua` — quantized predicates are telic, not conversely.
* `not_isTelic_of_cum` — a cumulative predicate of two successive events is not telic.
* `SINC.inc_of_sum`, `INC.sum` — a summative strictly incremental relation is incremental, and
  an incremental relation is summative.
* `vp_cum`, `vp_qua` — cumulativity and quantization carry over from the object to the verb
  phrase.

## Implementation notes

Temporal precedence is a parameter of the telicity notions. That overlapping events never
precede each other, a consequence of the event axioms, enters as `NoPartPrecedes`.
