# The universal scale

A measure `μ : E → D` orders a finite comparison class `C` by a quasi-order whose classes are the
values `C.image μ`. Bale's universal degree of a member is the position of its class: one plus
the number of classes below it, over the number of classes, a rational between zero and one.
Universal degrees record positions and nothing else. They are unchanged by any order embedding of
the scale, and on a comparison class two measures give the same universal degrees exactly when
they induce the same quasi-order. Comparing two measures directly is not invariant under
rescaling one of them (`Degree.cross_scale_not_natural`), but comparing their universal degrees
is, which is what makes a comparison between different adjectives meaningful.

## Main definitions

* `Degree.relativeRank`: the position of a value in a finite scale, as a fraction of the scale.
* `Degree.universalDegree`: the universal degree of a member of a comparison class under a
  measure.

## Main statements

* `Degree.universalDegree_comp`: universal degrees are invariant under order embeddings of the
  scale.
* `Degree.ker_universalDegree`: on a comparison class, universal degrees are a complete invariant
  of the quasi-order the measure induces.
* `Degree.universalDegree_eq_iff`: two members share a universal degree exactly when they are
  equivalent in Cresswell's sense.

## Implementation notes

A comparison class is a `Finset`, Klein's comparison class made finite so that its classes can be
counted. The primary scale, the quotient of the restricted quasi-order, is order-isomorphic to
`C.image μ`, where universal degrees are computed; `ker_universalDegree` makes the choice of
measure immaterial.
