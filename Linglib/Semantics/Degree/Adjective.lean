# Gradable adjectives

This file defines `Degree.GradableAdjective`, a syntactic adjective together with its degree
semantics. The scale an adjective measures on, its positive standard and its Kennedy class are
derived from its dimension, its polarity and any lexically fixed standard, so that *wet* and *dry*
share one scale and differ only in pole. The file also defines antonym pairs and the ways a
multidimensional adjective binds its dimensions.

An antonym pair is contradictory when its poles take complementary standards, the minimum and the
maximum of one scale, as Kennedy and McNally explain for *open* and *closed*. A pair of extreme
adjectives such as *pristine* and *filthy* leaves a gap even on a closed scale, as Alexandropoulou
and Gotzner observe, since its standards lie beyond those of the weak pair; the relation is read
off the standards rather than stored. How a standard is interpreted, as a literal endpoint or
relative to a contextual range, is left to the studies.

## Main definitions

* `AdjectiveClass`: Kennedy's classes of gradable adjectives.
* `GradableAdjective`: a syntactic adjective with its degree semantics.
* `GradableAdjective.scaleType`: the scale an adjective measures on.
* `GradableAdjective.standard`: the positive standard of an adjective.
* `AntonymPair`: the two polar adjectives of one scale.
* `AntonymPair.ComplementaryStandards`: the poles take the minimum and the maximum, and so are
  contradictory, where any other pair leaves a gap and is contrary; without lexical standards
  this holds exactly on a half-closed scale
  (`AntonymPair.complementaryStandards_iff_of_lexicalStandard_none`).
* `DimensionBindingType`: how a multidimensional adjective binds its dimensions.

/-! ### Kennedy's adjective classes -/

/-- An adjective class is Kennedy's classification of an adjective by its scale structure and
standard ([kennedy-2007], [kennedy-mcnally-2005]), with further classes for the lexical necessity
and extreme standards and for non-gradable adjectives. -/
inductive AdjectiveClass where
  /-- The standard varies with a comparison class, as for *tall*, *expensive* and *big*. -/
  | relative
  /-- The standard is the maximum of the scale, as for *full*, *straight*, *closed* and *dry*. -/
  | absoluteMaximum
  /-- The standard is the minimum of the scale, as for *wet*, *bent*, *open* and *dirty*. -/
  | absoluteMinimum
  /-- The standard is a necessity threshold, as for *decent* and *acceptable* ([beltrama-2025]). -/
  | mildlyPositive
  /-- The standard lies beyond that of the weak adjective on the same pole, as for *gigantic* and
  *pristine* ([morzycki-2012]). -/
  | extreme
  /-- The adjective has no degree argument and no scale, as for *atomic*, *prime*, *deceased* and
  *pregnant*; an adjective that is not gradable belongs here rather than in a gradable class. -/
  | nonGradable
