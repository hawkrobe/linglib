# Antonymy

This file defines the vocabulary of an antonym pair of gradable adjectives, *tall* and *short*
or *happy* and *unhappy*. Following Kennedy (2007) and Kennedy and McNally (2005), the two
members measure the same degrees under inverse orderings, so an adjective's `Polarity` is which
member it is, `positive` for the member measuring in the scale's increasing direction (*tall*)
and `negative` for the inverted one (*short*). Inverting twice restores the ordering, so
`negative * p` is the polarity of the antonym of a `p` adjective, and polarity acts on scale
boundedness and on comparisons through the order dual. The positive forms of the members are
contradictory (*clean* and *dirty*) or contrary (*tall* and *short*, which leave a gap), two
cells of the Aristotelian square in the sense of Cruse and Horn; a lexical pair is contradictory
when its poles take complementary standards, `Degree.AntonymPair.ComplementaryStandards`.

The contrary case is modelled by a `Degree.ThresholdPair` on a linearly ordered scale, the
positive form true above its upper threshold and the negative form below its lower one, and
`Degree.AntonymForm` is the quadruplet *happy*, *not happy*, *unhappy*, *not unhappy* that
sentential negation generates from a pair, with a contradictory denotation on one threshold,
where *not unhappy* collapses to *happy*, and a strengthened denotation on a pair, where the gap
keeps them apart, as in Krifka's account. Evaluative valence, whether a predicate denotes a good
or a bad property, is a second axis on which the poles differ, distinct from polarity.

## Main definitions

* The actions of `Polarity` on `Boundedness` and on `Comparison`, the negative polarity by the
  order dual.
* `EvaluativeValence`: whether a gradable predicate denotes a good, a bad or a neutral property.
* `ThresholdPair` and its `ThresholdPair.gap`, the interval between the two thresholds.
* `AntonymForm` with `AntonymForm.contradictoryDenot`, `AntonymForm.strengthenedDenot` and
  `AntonymForm.complexity`.

## Main results

* `AntonymForm.contradictoryDenot_notPositive`: contradictory negation is the complement, so
  double negation eliminates.
* `ThresholdPair.gap_nonempty_iff`, `AntonymForm.strengthenedDenot_notNegative_diff_positive`,
  `AntonymForm.strengthenedDenot_notPositive_diff_negative`: a pair leaves a gap when its lower
  threshold does not exceed its upper one, and the gap is what each negated form adds to the
  opposite simple form.
* `isCompl_contradictoryDenot`, `isContrary_strengthenedDenot`: the two denotations
  realize the two cells of the Aristotelian square.

/-! ### Polarity -/

/-- The negative member of an antonym pair measures on the dual scale; two inversions restore the
ordering, so the antonym of *short* is *tall*. Markedness is a separate matter, since equipollent
pairs like *hot* and *cold* have no unmarked member. Sentential negation acts on the adjective's
denotation by complement instead, so *not short* is the contradictory of *short* and does not
entail *tall* (`AntonymForm.strengthenedDenot`). -/

/-! ### Evaluative valence -/

/-- The evaluative valence of a gradable predicate records whether it denotes a good, a bad or
an evaluatively neutral property, which is distinct from scalar polarity ([nouwen-2024]).
Negative valence yields high-degree intensifiers and positive valence moderate-degree ones, which
Nouwen explains by the Goldilocks effect, the negative evaluation of a scale's extremes. -/

neutral. -/

  | .positive => .negative
  | .negative => .positive
  | .neutral => .neutral

/-! ### The two-threshold model of a contrary pair -/

/-- The two thresholds of a contrary antonym pair (*happy* and *unhappy*) are `pos` for the
positive form, true above it, and `neg` for the negative form, true below it. That the lower
threshold does not exceed the upper is a hypothesis where a gap is needed, not a stored
invariant. -/

end ThresholdPair

/-! ### The quadruplet -/

/-- An antonym form is one of the four surface forms that sentential negation generates from an
antonym pair, *happy*, *not happy*, *unhappy* and *not unhappy*. The type carries no
semantics; a contradictory account collapses the four to two denotations and a contrary
account keeps four, and each is a function on it. -/
