# Admissible measures and dimensional restriction

A measure function is admissible for a background ordering when it is strictly monotone, mathlib's
`StrictMono`. The condition recurs under several names: Schwarzschild's Monotonicity Constraint on
the measures of pseudopartitives, Wellwood's admissibility for the measure of *much*, the
confidence orderings of Cariani, Santorio and Wellwood, and Pasternak's monotonicity of intensity
on mental states; Krifka's extensive measures have it over parts with remainders. A domain is
dimensionally restricted if any two admissible measures order its elements alike. Linear orders
are dimensionally restricted, and multi-dimensional orders such as weight × volume are not.

## Main definitions

* `DimensionallyRestricted`: any two admissible measures agree on the comparative ordering.

## Main statements

* `linearOrder_dimensionallyRestricted`, `prod_not_dimensionallyRestricted`: linear orders are
  dimensionally restricted, and a product order is not.

/-- A domain is dimensionally restricted if any two admissible measure functions into the scale
`D` agree on the comparative ordering of all its elements, so that the background ordering alone
determines the comparative. Linear orders are dimensionally restricted
(`linearOrder_dimensionallyRestricted`), and the componentwise order on `D × D` is not
(`prod_not_dimensionallyRestricted`). -/

  ∀ (μ₁ μ₂ : α → D), StrictMono μ₁ → StrictMono μ₂ →
    ∀ (a b : α), μ₁ a < μ₁ b ↔ μ₂ a < μ₂ b

comparative ordering whichever admissible measure function is chosen. -/

/-- The componentwise-ordered `D × D` (weight × volume) is not dimensionally restricted, since
the admissible measures `2·w + v` and `w + v` order the incomparable elements `(0, 1)` and
`(1, 0)` differently; this is the multi-dimensional signature of entity and event domains. -/
