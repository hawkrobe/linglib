# Scale granularity

A granularity function of width `w` maps each degree to an interval of width `w` that contains
it. The grain of width `ε` is the granularity function that reports each degree by the nearest
multiple of `ε`: degrees with the same nearest multiple are indistinguishable, and the cell of a
degree is the half-open interval of width `ε` centred on that multiple. Krifka builds levels of
precision this way, Sauerland and Stateva define granularity functions by the properties
collected in `IsGranularity`, and Deo and Thomas take the cells of a grain as the answers to a
degree question.

A finer grain is a narrower one, not a refinement. No cell of a wider granularity function fits
inside a cell of a narrower one, and a grain refines the grain `k` times as wide exactly when `k`
is odd, so halving the width never refines. Around a common multiple of two widths the cells are
nested.

## Main definitions

* `Degree.IsGranularity`: a granularity function of a given width.
* `Degree.grain`: the partition of the scale by nearest multiple of `ε`.
* `Degree.representative`: the nearest multiple of `ε`.

## Main results

* `Degree.cell_grain`: a cell is the half-open interval of width `ε` centred on its
  representative.
* `Degree.IsGranularity.not_subset`: a cell of a wider granularity function never
  fits inside a cell of a narrower one.
* `Degree.isGranularity_zero_iff`: the granularity function of width zero is the exact reading,
  every cell a single degree.
* `Degree.cell_grain_subset_cell_grain`: around a common multiple, a finer cell lies inside a
  coarser one.
* `Degree.grain_le_grain_iff_odd`: the grain of width `ε` refines the grain of width
  `k * ε` exactly when `k` is odd.

## Implementation notes

Cells are half-open, the only choice of endpoints that partitions the scale; Sauerland and Stateva
write closed intervals and Thomas and Deo open ones. `IsGranularity` states the width by placing
each cell between the open and the closed interval of that width, which leaves the endpoints
open, as Thomas and Deo recommend, and needs no `sSup`, which `ℚ` lacks.
