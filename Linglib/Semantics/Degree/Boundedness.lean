# Scale boundedness

This file defines `Degree.Boundedness`, the classification of scales by the endpoints they have,
for which Kennedy and McNally and, independently, Rotstein and Winter gave evidence from degree
modifiers. A boundedness is
the endpoint profile of an order, and `Boundedness.ofOrder D` reads it off `D` from the existence of
a least and a greatest element, so that a scale's tag is a fact about its degrees. The tag is what a
lexical entry stores, since a record field cannot hold an `OrderTop` instance.

The negative member of an antonym pair measures on the same degrees in the reverse order, and
`Boundedness.dual` is that operation on tags. The file also defines the standards of the positive
form and Kennedy's Interpretive Economy, which selects among them by the tag. A scale with an
endpoint rules out the contextual standard, and a totally closed scale prefers its maximum.

## Main definitions

* `Boundedness`: the four endpoint profiles, with the predicates `HasMin` and `HasMax`.
* `Boundedness.ofOrder`: the boundedness of an order.
* `Boundedness.dual`: the boundedness with its ends exchanged.
* `Boundedness.withMin`: the boundedness with a least degree adjoined.
* `Boundedness.withMax`: the boundedness with a greatest degree adjoined.
* `Boundedness.degreeShape`: a linear order of each boundedness.
* `PositiveStandard`: the standards of the positive form.
* `Boundedness.Admits`: the standards Interpretive Economy admits on a scale.
* `Boundedness.defaultStandard`: the standard Interpretive Economy prefers on a scale.

## Main results

* `Boundedness.ofOrder_orderDual`: the order dual has the dual boundedness.
* `Boundedness.ofOrder_Ici`: a ray upward has a least degree adjoined.
* `Boundedness.ofOrder_Iic`: a ray downward has a greatest degree adjoined.
* `Boundedness.ofOrder_Icc`, `Boundedness.ofOrder_Ioo`, `Boundedness.ofOrder_Ioc`: a closed
  interval is totally closed, and an open or half-open interval of a dense order is open or upper
  closed.
* `Boundedness.ofOrder_degreeShape`: every boundedness is that of a linear order.
* `Boundedness.admits_withMin_iff`: a scale with a least degree adjoined admits the minimum
  standard, and the maximum exactly when the original scale has one.

/-! ### Standards and Interpretive Economy

The positive form of a gradable predicate is true of what meets a standard on its scale.
Interpretive Economy maximizes the contribution of conventional meaning, so a scale with an endpoint
rules out the contextual standard, and a totally closed scale admits both endpoint standards and
prefers the maximum. -/

/-- A positive standard is the kind of threshold the positive form compares a degree with, a
contextual norm on an open scale and an endpoint on a closed one ([kennedy-2007]), or a standard
an adjective fixes lexically outside that choice. -/
inductive PositiveStandard where
  /-- The norm of a comparison class, as for *tall*. -/
  | contextual
  /-- The minimum of the scale, as for *bent* and *wet*. -/
  | minEndpoint
  /-- The maximum of the scale, as for *full* and *dry*. -/
  | maxEndpoint
  /-- The minimum degree for pursuit ([beltrama-2025]). -/
  | necessity
  /-- A standard beyond that of the weak adjective on the same pole, as for *gigantic* and
  *pristine* ([morzycki-2012]). -/
  | extreme
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- A standard requires a comparison class when fixing it needs contextual information about a
domain. [kennedy-2007] argues against a comparison-class argument of the positive form, as in
[klein-1980], and states the positive form with a standard-fixing function,
`⟦pos⟧ = λg.λx. g(x) ⪰ s(g)` ((27)), which still needs that information for the contextual and
necessity standards. An extreme standard lies beyond the degrees a context makes salient
([morzycki-2012]), so it needs that information too. -/
