# Measure phrases and the changes of scale they survive

A measure-phrase differential (*3 inches taller*) says that two measures differ by a given amount,
and a factor phrase (*twice as tall*) that one measure is a multiple of another. In measurement
theory a statement about measurements is meaningful when its truth survives every admissible change
of scale: a strictly monotone map on an ordinal scale, a positive affine map on an interval scale,
a positive scaling on a ratio scale. A differential survives translations, and under a change of
unit it holds once its amount is rescaled too. A factor phrase survives scalings but not
translations, so *twice as hot* in degrees Celsius is not meaningful. Neither survives an arbitrary
strictly monotone change of scale, which is why an ordinal adjective such as *beautiful* takes
neither.

## Main statements

* `differentialComparative_comp_iff_commute`, `factorEquative_comp_iff_commute`: a differential or
  a factor phrase survives an injective change of scale exactly when the change commutes with
  adding its amount or multiplying by its factor.
* `differentialComparative_const_mul_add_const`: a differential survives translations, and a
  change of unit rescales its amount.
* `factorEquative_add_const_iff`: a factor phrase survives a translation only when the factor fixes
  the translation, so in a domain only the trivial factor or translation.

subtraction, not just an ordering, which makes measure-phrase differentials more restrictive than
bare comparatives. -/

meaningful zero, a ratio scale. -/
