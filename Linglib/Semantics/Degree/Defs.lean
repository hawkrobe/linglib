# Degree constructions

This file defines `Degree.Construction`, the surface forms a gradable
predicate can appear in — bare positive, comparative, equative, measure
phrase, and degree question ([beck-2011], [rett-2015]). The Deg⁰ head
inventory is defined in `Linglib/Syntax/Category/Degree/Basic.lean`.

  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- Bare lowercase construction names for diagnostic messages, distinct
