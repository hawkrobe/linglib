# Background orderings and threshold properties

In the states-based analysis of gradable predicates of Cariani, Santorio and Wellwood, which
builds on Wellwood's comparative and which the same authors apply to confidence reports, a
gradable predicate contributes two things: a background ordering of
states, the states of having some heat for *hot*, and in each context a threshold property, the
states that count as hot. The positive form says that the subject holds a state with the
threshold property. The comparative bypasses the threshold: an admissible measure of one of
the subject's states exceeds the greatest degree of the standard's. No covert positive morpheme
is needed, and neither form entails the other.

The background is a preorder `S` and a threshold property is an upper set `T` of it, the
monotonicity postulate of the analysis. A map `ρ : S → X` sends each state to its holder, or to
its theme, so the positive form of `x` is `x ∈ ρ '' T`, and the comparative of `a` over `b` is
`Degree.MaxComparative .gt (ρ · = a) (ρ · = b) μ` for an admissible measure `μ`. This file adds no
definitions. It records how the two components interact: the one inference from a comparative
to a positive form, upward monotonicity, holds on a total background and on no other.

Read as extensions, the threshold properties form a monotone delineation exactly when the
background is total, the parallel the authors draw with Klein's consistency postulate, and the
thresholds are degree thresholds pulled back along the measure exactly when the measure reflects
the background.

## Main statements

* `mem_image_of_maxComparative`: if `b` has the property and `a` has more of it than `b`, then
  `a` has the property, given an admissible measure and a total background.
* `maxComparative_and_not_mem_image`: the comparative does not entail the positive form.
* `isMonotoneOn_upperSets_iff`: the thresholds form a monotone delineation iff the background
  is total.
* `forall_isUpperSet_exists_preimage_iff`: the thresholds are pulled-back degree thresholds iff
  the measure reflects the background.

/-! ### Upward monotonicity -/

/-- If `b` has the property and `a` has more of it than `b`, then `a` has the property. The
comparative supplies a state of `a`'s measuring above a state of `b`'s with the property, an
admissible measure on a total background places it above that state, and the threshold is upward
closed. -/
theorem mem_image_of_maxComparative [@Std.Total S (· ≤ ·)] (hT : IsUpperSet T)
    (hμ : StrictMono μ) {a b : X} (hb : b ∈ ρ '' T)
    (h : MaxComparative .gt (ρ · = a) (ρ · = b) μ) : a ∈ ρ '' T :=
  let ⟨_, hs, hsb⟩ := hb
  let ⟨y, hya, hlt⟩ := h.exists_lt hsb
  ⟨y, hT (hμ.reflect_le hlt.le) hs, hya⟩

/-- Without admissibility upward monotonicity fails even on a total background. On `Bool` with
the measure reversed, `true` has the property `Ici true` and `false` measures above it. -/
example :
    (true : Bool) ∈ id '' Ici true ∧ MaxComparative .gt (· = false) (· = true) (fun b : Bool ↦ !b) ∧
      false ∉ id '' Ici true := by

  rintro ⟨u, hu, rfl⟩
  exact absurd (mem_Ici.1 hu) (by decide)

/-- Without totality upward monotonicity fails. When `s` and `t` are the only states of their
holders, `s` is not below `t` but measures below it, and the property is the one of lying above
`s`, the holder of `s` has the property and the holder of `t` has more of it without having it. -/

/-- The failure is realized by an admissible measure. On the componentwise order of `ℕ × ℕ`,
the sum of the coordinates is admissible and puts `(1, 0)` below the incomparable `(0, 2)`. -/
example :
    StrictMono (fun x : ℕ × ℕ ↦ x.1 + x.2) ∧ ¬ ((1, 0) : ℕ × ℕ) ≤ (0, 2) ∧

/-- Admissibility alone does not yield a separating threshold. With two tied states every
measure is admissible and every threshold holding of one holds of the other. The preorder is
passed explicitly, since `Bool`'s own order would otherwise be found. -/
