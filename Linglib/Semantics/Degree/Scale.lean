# Scalar dimensions

This file defines `Degree.ScalarDimension`, the dimensions along which gradable adjectives and
degree achievements measure, such as height, temperature and fullness. A dimension has a
perceptual domain, the shape of its scale in its increasing direction, and, when it is a dimension
of physical measurement, the physical dimension its degrees are measured in. Evaluative and
psychological scales have none, which is why they reject measure phrases (*six feet tall* but not
*six feet happy*), and speed is a primitive lexical scale although physically a quotient, in line
with Bale and Schwarz's hypothesis that semantic composition has no quantity division. The degrees
of a
dimension are the canonical linear order of its scale's shape, and the default Vendler class of a
degree achievement is read off that shape.

## Main definitions

* `ScalarDimension`: the dimensions of gradable predicates.
* `ScalarDimension.domain`: the perceptual or cognitive domain of a dimension.
* `ScalarDimension.boundedness`: the shape of a dimension's scale.
* `ScalarDimension.dimension?`: the physical dimension of a dimension, if it has one.
* `ScalarDimension.degree`: the degrees of a dimension.
* `Boundedness.defaultVendlerClass`: the default Vendler class of a degree achievement on a scale.

## Main results

* `ScalarDimension.defaultTelicity_telic_iff_hasGreatest`: a degree achievement is telic by default
  exactly when the degrees of its scale have a greatest element.

/-- The shape of a dimension's scale in its increasing direction ([kennedy-mcnally-2005]
    (24)–(27), [kennedy-2007] (33), (49)–(50), (60)). Wetness is lower closed, *wet* taking a
    minimum standard and *dry* a maximum one, straightness upper closed, by *fully straight*
    against *??fully bent*, and fullness closed, by *100% full* and *100% empty*. Possibility is
    lower closed, since nothing is less possible than the impossible ([lassiter-2017] §5.2.3), so
    *possible* takes a minimum standard and *impossible* a maximum one, as *wet* and *dry* do;
    whether it also has a maximum turns on the disputed identity of its scale with that of
    *likely*. The negative member of an antonym pair measures on the dual scale. The definition is
    reducible, so that order instances on the degrees of a dimension see through it. -/

/-! ### Bridges to the physical quantity algebra -/

/-- The physical dimension a scalar dimension is measured in, if any. Spatial scales are
    measured in distance, weight in mass, age in time, temperature in temperature and quantity in
    cardinality, and *fast* lexicalizes the quotient of distance by time as a primitive scale.
    Evaluative, psychological and state scales, which reject ratio measure phrases, have none. -/
