# Algebraic mereology

Algebraic semantics models parthood as a partial order and mereological sum as join. The
reference properties of predicates are then mathlib set predicates: cumulativity is
`SupClosed`, divisiveness `IsLowerSet` and quantization `IsAntichain (· ≤ ·)`, and Link's
closure `*P` is `supClosure`. A carrier may have a null individual, as a Boolean algebra does,
or none, as a classical mereology does. Atoms and overlap are stated relative to mathlib's
`IsBot`, so on an `OrderBot` carrier they are `IsAtom` and `¬ Disjoint`.

## Main definitions

* `CUM`, `DIV`, `QUA`: cumulative, divisive and quantized reference.
* `AlgClosure P`: the closure of `P` under binary sum.
* `Atom`, `Overlap`, `IsPlural`, `atomCount`: atoms, overlap, proper pluralities, and the number
  of atoms below an element.
* `HasRemainders α`: every proper part is completed to the whole by a non-overlapping part.
* `IsClassicalMereology α`: classical extensional mereology, in which every inhabited predicate
  has a unique sum.
* `IsExtensiveMeasure μ`: extensive measure functions, and the measure phrases `QMOD` they build.
* `OverlapPred`, `DisjointPred`, `IsMaxDisjointIn`, `nullSchema`: individuation perspectives.

## Main results

* `qua_cum_incompatible`: a quantized predicate with two members is not cumulative.
* `IsClassicalMereology.existsUnique_remainder`: in a classical mereology a proper part has a
  unique remainder, so classical mereologies, like Boolean algebras, have remainders.
* `IsExtensiveMeasure.strictMono`: over a carrier with remainders an extensive measure is strictly
  monotone, so the measure phrases it builds are quantized (`qmod_qua`); the atom count is
  likewise extensive on sums of atoms (`qua_algClosure_atomCount`).
* `nullSchema_eq`: every member of a predicate lies in some individuation perspective.

## Implementation notes

`AlgClosure` closes under binary sums, which agrees with closure under sums of arbitrary
nonempty subsets only for finite sums. Classical mereology is defined, as in [champollion-2017],
by unique sums in Tarski's sense; [hovda-2009] compares the alternative axiomatizations. Since
`Overlap` excludes null parts, the element of a one-point carrier is null, so the trivial model
is not a classical mereology.

Cumulative, divisive and quantized reference are the mathlib set predicates
`SupClosed`, `IsLowerSet` and `IsAntichain (· ≤ ·)` on the extension of a predicate,
so hypotheses of these forms are applied directly: `hC hx hy : P (x ⊔ y)`,
`hD hle hx : P y`, `hQ hx hy hne : ¬ x ≤ y`. -/

A proper part of a whole is completed to the whole by a remainder that does not overlap it.

[krifka-1989], and the unique separation of [champollion-2017]. Boolean algebras satisfy it with
the difference `y \ x`, and so do classical mereologies (`IsClassicalMereology.exists_remainder`).

Classical extensional mereology is the system of [champollion-krifka-2016] and

Tarski's sense. Weak and strong supplementation, the remainder principle and the absence of a
null individual are theorems; [hovda-2009] compares this axiomatization with others. Binary sums
are fusions of pairs (`IsClassicalMereology.toSemilatticeSup`), and the nonempty subsets of a set
with two elements or more form a classical mereology. -/

/-! ### Extensive measures

[krifka-1989] and [krifka-1998] define an extensive measure by additivity over non-overlapping
elements and positivity, and derive from the remainder principle that a proper part measures less
than the whole. [champollion-krifka-2016] call a measure extensive on a set when it has that
property there. Either way, the measure phrases such a measure builds are quantized. -/

/-! ### Individuation perspectives

A predicate is overlapping if two distinct members share a part, and disjoint otherwise; a
maximally disjoint subset is an individuation perspective ([landman-2011], [landman-2020]),
and the null schema of [sutton-filip-2021] unions all perspectives. The overlap relation
`ov` is a parameter (mereologically, `Overlap`). -/
