# Content Layers
[van-der-sandt-maier-2003]

Semantic content is stratified into layers that determine its discourse
behavior: how it projects, what denial can target, and whether it
addresses the QUD.

[van-der-sandt-maier-2003] propose Layered DRT (LDRT), where every DRS
condition carries a label — `pr` (presupposition), `fr` (at-issue), or
`imp` (implicature) — that determines how it behaves in denial. This
module extracts the layer system as a standalone type that unifies several
existing linglib distinctions:

- `PartialProp` (presup + assertion) is the 2-layer special case (`pr` + `fr`)
- `AtIssueness` (atIssue vs notAtIssue) classifies content by whether it
  addresses the QUD — correlating with `fr` vs `pr`/`imp`

## The Three Layers

| Layer | Label | Denial example |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Presupposition | `pr` | "The king of France is NOT bald — there is no king" (30b) |
| At-issue | `fr` | "Mary is NOT happy — she's miserable" (5) |
| Implicature | `imp` | "It's not POSSIBLE — it's NECESSARY" (29b) |

## Design Note

`ContentLayer` lives in `Semantics/` because it generalizes `PartialProp`.
The diagnostic SCF/OLE taxonomy of projective content
([tonhauser-beaver-roberts-simons-2013]) lives in
`Semantics/Presupposition/ProjectiveContent.lean`.

## Scope

This module captures the layer taxonomy and the `Off` function (which
layers are offensive = inconsistent with a correction). The directed
reverse anaphora (RA*) mechanism that uses `Off` to selectively retract
conditions is defined in `Studies/VanDerSandtMaier2003.lean` as
`LDRS.directedRA`.

## See also: `Semantics/Composition/Layered.BiLayered`

`Semantics/Composition/Layered.lean` defines a 2-layer Prop-valued
sibling `BiLayered W` (atIssue / notAtIssue, both `W → Prop`) with
[martinez-vera-2026]'s composition rules I/II/III. Use `LayeredProp`
when LDRT's offensive-layer machinery is needed; use `BiLayered` when
the analysis only distinguishes at-issue from not-at-issue and operates
over `Set W` (verum, evidential illocution, biased polar questions). A
future `Layered n` parameterised refactor would consolidate the two.

/-! ### Example 1: King of France (30)

"The king of France is bald" has:
- `pr`: France has a king (definite presupposition)
- `fr`: The king is bald (at-issue content)
- `imp`: trivially true (no implicature)

Two corrections disambiguate the denial:
- "He has a full head of hair" → propositional denial (only `fr` offensive)
- "France does not have a king" → presuppositional denial (`pr` and `fr` both offensive)
-/

private inductive KFWorld | kingBald | kingHairy | noKing1 | noKing2
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

private def kfPresup : KFWorld → Bool
  | .kingBald | .kingHairy => true | _ => false

private def kfAssert : KFWorld → Bool
  | .kingBald => true | _ => false

private def kfProp : LayeredProp KFWorld :=
  { presupposition := kfPresup, atIssue := kfAssert }

private def kfWorlds : List KFWorld := [.kingBald, .kingHairy, .noKing1, .noKing2]

/-- Propositional denial: correction "he has hair" conflicts with `fr` only.

    The presupposition (king exists) is consistent with the correction
    (world `kingHairy` satisfies both), so `pr` is NOT offensive. But no
    world is both bald and hairy, so `fr` IS offensive.

    Corresponds to the standard propositional-denial reading of (30). -/

    offensiveLayers kfProp (λ w => w == .kingHairy) kfWorlds = [.atIssue] := by
  decide

/-- Presuppositional denial: correction "no king exists" conflicts with
    both `pr` and `fr`.

    No world has both "king exists" and "no king exists," so `pr` is
    offensive. No world is both "bald" and "no king," so `fr` is ALSO
    offensive — the assertion "falls with" the presupposition.

    Corresponds to (30b): "The king of France is NOT bald — France does
    not have a king." -/
theorem kf_presuppositional_denial :
    offensiveLayers kfProp (λ w => w == .noKing1 || w == .noKing2) kfWorlds
    = [.presupposition, .atIssue] := by

/-! ### Example 2: Possibility → Necessity (29)

"It is possible that the pope is right" has:
- `pr`: trivially true
- `fr`: ◇p (it is possible)
- `imp`: ¬□p (not necessary — the scalar implicature of "possible")

Correction: "It is NECESSARY that the pope is right" (□p).
Only `imp` is offensive: ◇p is consistent with □p (necessity entails
possibility), but ¬□p contradicts □p.
-/

private inductive ModalW | possNotNec | nec
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

private def modalProp : LayeredProp ModalW :=

      | .possNotNec => true
      | .nec => false }

private def modalWorlds : List ModalW := [.possNotNec, .nec]

/-- Implicature denial: correction "it is necessary" conflicts with `imp` only.

    The presupposition (trivially true) and at-issue content (◇p) are both
    consistent with the correction (□p entails ◇p). Only the scalar
    implicature (¬□p) conflicts.

    Corresponds to (29b): "It is not POSSIBLE, it is NECESSARY that the
    pope is right." -/

/-! ### `BiLayered`: 2-layer ⟨A, N⟩ Prop-valued sibling

A `Prop`-valued 2-layer sibling of `LayeredProp` ([martinez-vera-2026],
inheriting the percolation discipline of [potts-2005] and the at-issue
proposal / appositive imposition split of [anderbois-brasoveanu-henderson-2015]):
the at-issue layer is the proffered content, the not-at-issue layer
backgrounds presuppositions, conventional implicatures, and evidential
commitments — collapsing `LayeredProp`'s `presupposition` and
`implicature` layers into a single `notAtIssue`. The substrate stays
propositional (`W → Prop`) because the consumers (verum studies,
evidential illocution, biased polar questions) operate over `Set W`.

| Rule | When to use | At-issue layer | Not-at-issue layer |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------------------|
| I    | β has trivial NAI; α brings NAI | `α.A β.A` | `α.N β.A` |
| II   | both α and β bring NAI | `α.A β.A` | `α.N β.A ∧ β.N` |
