# Polarity items

A polarity item is a lexical item with a defective distribution: a negative polarity item occurs
only in a negative context and a positive polarity item cannot occur in one
([vanderwouden-1997]). Both are graded by the strength of negation of `DEStrength`
([zwarts-1998]): a negative polarity item needs at least some strength, which licenses it, and a
positive polarity item is blocked by at least some strength, which anti-licenses it. The two are
independent, and an item with both, like Dutch *ooit* 'ever', is bipolar. A free choice item is
licensed in the generic contexts instead ([kadmon-landman-1993], [dayal-1996]); English *any* is
both a negative polarity item and a free choice item.

The record also holds the contexts in which the item is attested and those in which it is
attested to be out, the data against which `Semantics/Polarity/Licensing.lean` checks the theory.
