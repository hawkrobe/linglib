# Causal models

This file defines causal models in the sense of Halpern and Pearl. A causal model has a type `U`
of exogenous contexts, a value type `α v` for each endogenous variable `v`, a directed graph on
the variables (mathlib's `Digraph`), and for each variable a structural equation that gives its
value from the context and the values of its parents in the graph. An intervention holds some
variables at fixed values, and the others obey their equations (`CausalModel.step`). When the
graph is well founded, every context and every intervention determine exactly one assignment
that satisfies the equations, `CausalModel.solve`.

The solution is characterized as the unique fixed point of `step`, and it is reached by
iterating `step` from any assignment once per rank of a ranking of the graph, which is how a
finite model computes it.

## Main definitions

* `CausalModel U V α`: exogenous contexts `U`, a graph, and structural equations
* `CausalModel.IsAcyclic`: the graph is well founded
* `CausalModel.ContextAtRoots`: only the roots read the context
* `CausalModel.step`: one round of the equations, with the intervened variables held fixed
* `CausalModel.solve`: the solution under an intervention in a context
* `[c ← x, d ← y]`: the partial assignment settling `c` and `d`, scoped in `CausalModel`

## Main results

* `CausalModel.isFixedPt_solve`, `CausalModel.eq_solve_of_isFixedPt`: the solution is the unique
  fixed point of `step`
* `CausalModel.solve_eq_iterate`, `CausalModel.solve_eq_iterate_card`: iterating `step` past a
  ranking of the graph reaches it, so in a finite model `decide` evaluates the solution
  (`CausalModel.decidableEqSolve`)

## Implementation notes

An equation reads the whole assignment, and `dependsOn_eqn` says that it only reads the parents
(mathlib's `DependsOn`), so equations are written without the parents' subtype. For a finite
inductive type of variables the default proof of `dependsOn_eqn` discharges it. The graph is data,
the edges a paper draws, and bounds what an equation may read rather than recording what it does
read. An intervention is a partial assignment `∀ v, Flat (α v)`, the variables it settles being the
intervened ones. The solution is `WellFounded.fixedPoint` of `step`, whose construction fills the
coordinates an equation ignores arbitrarily, hence `[∀ v, Nonempty (α v)]`.

A concrete model in a study is written to one recipe. The exogenous context is a structure whose
fields name what the paper leaves to the world (`structure Context where match : Bool`, with
`deriving DecidableEq, Fintype, Inhabited, Repr`), never a positional tuple. The edges are a
`Finset (V × V)` (`def edges : Finset (V × V) := {(.match, .fire)}`) with `graph :=
⟨fun w v ↦ (w, v) ∈ edges⟩`, adjacency is decided by `fun w v ↦ inferInstanceAs (Decidable
((w, v) ∈ edges))`, and acyclicity by `Finite.wellFounded_of_irrefl_transGen (by decide)`.
Partial assignments are written in the scoped notation, `[c ← x, d ← y]`, and updates of a named
assignment as `Function.update s c ↑x`. A theorem quantifying over assignments or settlements
(necessity, sufficient sets) is proved structurally through the equations rather than by
`decide`, which enumerates them.

/-- A causal model is a directed graph on the variables `V` with a structural equation at each
variable. The equation gives the variable's value in `α v` from an exogenous context in `U` and
the values of the variable's parents, the sources of its incoming edges. -/
