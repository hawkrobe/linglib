# Causative Interpretation (force-dynamic dispatch)
[nadathur-lauer-2020] [talmy-1988] [wolff-2003]

Maps `Causative` verb classifications to their compositional semantics
under the **force-dynamic** view ([talmy-1988], [wolff-2003]),
which collapses `enable`/`force`/`make` into a single sufficiency
predicate (`causallySufficient`) distinguished post-hoc by `isCoercive`/`isPermissive`.

| Causative | Mechanism | English verbs | N&L property (derived) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| cause | Counterfactual dependence | cause | necessity |
| make | Direct sufficient guarantee | make, have, get | sufficiency |
| force | Coercive (overcome resistance) | force | sufficiency + coercion |
| enable | Barrier removal (permissive) | let, enable | sufficiency |
| prevent | Barrier addition (blocking) | prevent | preventSem |

## Theoretical commitment

This file commits to the force-dynamic mapping. The competing
**causal-model-theoretic** view ([sloman-barbey-hotaling-2009])
distinguishes `enable` from `make`/`cause` *structurally*: enable
asserts `B := A ∧ X` (accessory variable required), while cause asserts
`B := A`. Under that view, the present `Causative.toSemantics`
mis-classifies enable. The Sloman alternative dispatch — and a
divergence theorem witnessing the disagreement on `enable` — lives
in `Studies/SlomanBarbeyHotaling2009.lean`.

This is intentional. linglib does not pretend a single canonical
mapping exists; both dispatches coexist as named functions and the
disagreement is theorem-provable.

/-! ### Methods on `Features.Causative` -/

/-! Methods on `Features.Causative` that depend on heavy semantic
machinery (`Causation.SEM`, `CausalGraph`, the `Necessity`/
`Sufficiency`/`Prevention` modules) live here rather than in
`Features/Causation.lean`, which is kept import-free per the
"Features/ stays lightweight" convention. The `namespace
Features.Causative` block below is the standard mathlib pattern for
distributing methods on a type across files based on import weight. -/

theorem make_force_distinguished_by_coercion :

/-! ### Bridge to CC-Selection -/

/-! `Causative` encodes force-dynamic mechanisms; `CCSelectionMode`
([baglini-bar-asher-siegal-2025]) encodes which element of a causal
model the construction can select as "the cause." These are orthogonal
but connected: each variant has a canonical selection mode. -/

/-- Sufficiency variants have completion selection mode. -/
theorem sufficiency_selects_completion (b : Causative)
    (h : b.assertsSufficiency = true) :
    b.selectionMode = .completionOfSufficientSet := by
  cases b <;> simp_all [Causative.assertsSufficiency, Causative.selectionMode]

/-- Necessity variant has member selection mode. -/
theorem necessity_selects_member :
    Causative.cause.selectionMode = .memberOfSufficientSet := rfl
