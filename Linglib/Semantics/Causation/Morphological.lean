# Morphological causation: compactness and directness

[comrie-1989] [song-1996]

Causative constructions vary along two scales: **morphological complexity**, from compact
(lexical) to analytic (periphrastic), and **directness of mediation**, from a causer that brings
about the result itself to one that acts through a causee. [comrie-1989]'s generalization is that
within a language the more compact construction expresses the more direct causation
(`CausativeConstruction.ComrieMonotone`). The causee of a causativized verb takes the highest
grammatical relation its base verb leaves free (`causeeDemotion`), so the causee sinks as the
base valency rises (`causeeDemotion_antitoneOn`).

/-! ### Mediation -/

/-- Directness of causal mediation between causer and result.

[comrie-1989]: direct causation involves no intermediary, the causer bringing about the result
without an intervening causee decision or action; indirect causation involves a mediating causee
who retains some autonomy over the caused event. -/
inductive Mediation where
  /-- The causer brings about the result itself. -/
  | direct
  /-- The causer acts through an intermediary causee. -/
  | indirect
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Fintype

/-- Numeric rank: direct (0) < indirect (1). -/
def Mediation.rank : Mediation → ℕ
  | .direct => 0
  | .indirect => 1

/-- Direct < indirect: the directness scale. -/

/-! ### Causative complexity -/

/-- Morphological complexity of a causative construction, [comrie-1989]'s compact-to-analytic
continuum:
- **lexical**: suppletive or idiosyncratic (*kill* ~ *die*, *fell* ~ *fall*)
- **morphological**: a productive affix (Japanese *-(s)ase*)
- **periphrastic**: an analytic multi-word construction (English *make X do Y*)

`CausativeComplexity.lexical` is a construction-level claim ("this causative sits at the compact
end of Comrie's continuum"), while [song-1996]'s `CausativeMorphology.lexical` in
`Studies/Song1996.lean` is a morpheme-shape claim ("no separable causal morpheme exists"). English
*kill* satisfies both, but the two enums are not interconvertible: the bridge
`CausativeConstructionType.toComplexity` there sends Song's `compact / freeMorpheme` (French
*faire*-V) to `morphological`, although [folli-harley-2005] analyse French *faire* as
periphrastic. -/

/-! ### The causee-marking hierarchy -/

/-- Grammatical relations available to the causee, ordered from highest to lowest.

[comrie-1989]: when a verb is causativized, its original subject is demoted to the highest
relation on the hierarchy that the base verb's arguments leave free, so an intransitive base
yields a direct-object causee, a transitive one an indirect-object causee, and a ditransitive
one an oblique causee. -/

arguments leave free. -/

/-- The higher the base valency, the lower the causee lands. -/
