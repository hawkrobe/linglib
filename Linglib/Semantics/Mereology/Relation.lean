# Mereology of relations

Krifka states his conditions on the thematic relation between an object and an event as
part-structure properties of a relation `θ : α → β → Prop` between two mereologies. Uniqueness of
participants and of events are mathlib's `Relator.LeftUnique` and `Relator.RightUnique`,
summativity is cumulativity of the graph of `θ` in the product order, and the mapping and
uniqueness conditions relate the parts of a related object to the parts of its event. Each
condition on the event side is the object-side condition of the converse relation `flip θ`. When
the relation is the graph of a thematic function, as in [champollion-krifka-2016], the
conditions become properties of the function: summativity is preservation of sums, general
uniqueness of events is injectivity, and mapping to subobjects is strict monotonicity.

## Main definitions

* `UP`, `GUE`: uniqueness of participants and general uniqueness of events.
* `SUM`: summativity, the cumulativity of a relation.
* `ME`, `MSE`, `UE`: mapping to events, mapping to subevents, and uniqueness of events.
* `MO`, `MSO`, `UO`: mapping to objects, mapping to subobjects, and uniqueness of objects.

## Main results

* `UP.uo_of_mo`, `UE.mse_of_uo`: uniqueness of participants gives uniqueness of objects, and the
  two uniqueness conditions give the strict mappings.
* `UE.exists_orderIso_of_uo`: under both uniqueness conditions a related object and event have
  order-isomorphic parts.
* `UO.qua_of_mso`: the events of a fixed object form a quantized predicate.
* `gue_graph_iff`, `mso_graph_iff`, `sum_graph_iff`: the conditions on the graph of a thematic
  function.

the corresponding thematic relation. [champollion-krifka-2016] require of such a function
cumulativity (13.23), that it preserve sums, and distinctiveness (13.24), that distinct events
have distinct participants. -/
