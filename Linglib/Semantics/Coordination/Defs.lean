# The Coordinator unit — marking + operation

A coordinator (*and* / *or* / *but* / *nor*) is **one** thing: a lexical marking whose
`role` selects a Boolean operation. This file is the carrier-agnostic core of the
`Coordinator` API — it needs only `Mathlib.Order.BooleanAlgebra`, so Fragments import it
directly to type their lexical coordinators (the `Semantics/Verb/Defs.lean` precedent: a
word-class lexical-entry type at `Semantics/{class}/Defs`). The Denot-specific bridges
(`genConj = op`, `engineOp`, the `BooleanAlgebra (Denot)` instances) live downstream in
`Semantics/Coordination/Basic.lean`.

`op` is the *at-issue* truth-conditional operation: the role selects the Boolean method
(`⊓` / `⊔` / `(·⊔·)ᶜ`), the instance supplies the algebra. It is faithful for *and* (`.j`),
*or* (`.disj`), *nor* (`.negDisj`/`.negCoord`); the additive `.mu` and adversative `.advers`
collapse onto *and*'s meet here (`op_mu_eq_j`/`op_advers_eq_j`), their surplus content (M&S
additive/focus, adversative contrast) diverging to the relevant studies / the discourse layer.

## Main definitions

* `Coordinator.Role` — which Boolean operation a coordinator denotes.
* `Coordinator.op` — the operation a role denotes, polymorphic over `[BooleanAlgebra α]`.
* `Coordinator` — a lexical coordinator's marking (decidable data Fragments configure).

  /-- J particle: set intersection / conjunction proper
      (English "and", Hungarian "es", Georgian "da"). -/

      at-issue identical to `j`. -/

/-- **THE operation** a role denotes, polymorphic over any Boolean carrier: the role selects
    the Boolean method (`⊓` / `⊔` / `(·⊔·)ᶜ`), the instance supplies the algebra. Faithful for
    *and* (`.j`), *or* (`.disj`), *nor* (`.negDisj`/`.negCoord`); the additive `.mu` and
    adversative `.advers` give only the at-issue meet — `{j, mu, advers}` all collapse onto
    `⊓` here, the surplus diverging (see `op_mu_eq_j`/`op_advers_eq_j`). -/

  | .disj => (· ⊔ ·)
  | .negDisj | .negCoord => fun p q => (p ⊔ q)ᶜ

/-- Additive `.mu` has the same at-issue denotation as *and*; its M&S additive/focus
    dimension diverges (see `Studies/MitrovicSauerland2016`). -/
theorem op_mu_eq_j {α : Type*} [BooleanAlgebra α] : (op .mu : α → α → α) = op .j := rfl

/-- Adversative `.advers` (*but*) has the same at-issue denotation as *and*; its contrast is a
    discourse relation outside `op` (and non-commutative there, which the commutative `⊓`
    cannot represent). -/
