# The denotation of a coordinator

A coordinator denotes an operation on the set of its coordinands, which its semantic type fixes:
the infimum of the set for a conjunctive or adversative coordinator, its supremum for a
disjunctive one, and the complement of its supremum for a negative one. Coordinating two
constituents is the case of a two-element set, so one operation conjoins truth values,
predicates and generalized quantifiers, coordinates lists of any length, and builds the
quantifiers that Japanese *ka* and *mo* form from indeterminate pronouns. The composition engine
applies it to two sisters of one conjoinable type in `Semantics/Composition/Coordination.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `Coordinator.denote`: what a coordinator denotes on a set of coordinands.

## Main results

* `Coordinator.denote_of_conjunctive` and its siblings: the denotation by semantic type.
* `Coordinator.denote_singleton`, `Coordinator.denote_pair_self`: coordinating a constituent
  alone or with itself returns it, except under negative coordination.
* `Coordinator.denote_apply`: the coordination of functions is computed pointwise.

## Implementation notes

The denotation is the truth-conditional content only. The contrast an adversative coordinator
adds to conjunction is a relation between the coordinands in discourse, and
`denote_of_adversative` records that it is invisible here. The operation needs a complete Boolean
algebra, which the domain of every conjoinable type is, since such a type ends in `t`.
