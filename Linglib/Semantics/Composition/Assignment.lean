# Assignment-relative denotations

This file defines the denotations of pronouns and binders relative to a variable assignment
`g : ℕ → E`, which gives each index a value. In the textbook of Heim and Kratzer, the Traces and
Pronouns Rule has a pronoun or trace with index `n` denote `g n`, and Predicate Abstraction has a
binder at `n` abstract over the value of `n` by updating `g`. An assignment-relative denotation in
`α` is a function `Assignment E → α`, a computation of Lean's reader monad
`ReaderM (Assignment E)`. Charlow factors the standard theory through this monad: its `pure`,
`<*>` and `joinM` are his lift `ρ`, application `⊛` and flattener `μ`, and `lambdaAbsG` is his
categorematic abstraction `Λᵢ`.

The indices a denotation reads are those it depends on, in the sense of mathlib's `DependsOn`. A
pronoun reads its own index, an abstraction over `n` reads the indices its body reads other than
`n`, and abstracting over an index the body does not read gives a constant function.

## Main definitions

* `interpPronoun`: the denotation of a pronoun or trace.
* `lambdaAbsG`: abstraction over an index.

## Main results

* `dependsOn_interpPronoun`: a pronoun depends only on its index.
* `dependsOn_lambdaAbsG`: abstraction over `n` removes `n` from the indices a body depends on.
* `lambdaAbsG_eq_const_iff`: abstraction over `n` is constant at every assignment exactly when
  the body does not depend on `n`.

## Implementation notes

Assignments are total, where Heim and Kratzer's are partial, so a pronoun denotes at every
assignment. Nothing fixes `E` to entities: at an assignment of situations, `interpPronoun`
is a situation pronoun.
