# The Maybe Monad: Presupposition as Scope
[grove-2022]

[grove-2022] argues that presupposition projection is a scope phenomenon.
The key insight: presupposition triggers denote values of type `α_#` (= `Option α`),
and they interact with their semantic context by **taking scope** via monadic bind
(`Option.bind`), exactly paralleling [charlow-2020]'s treatment of indefinites
with the set monad.

The Maybe monad `(Option, some, bind)` is the presuppositional analog of
[charlow-2020]'s set monad `(S, η, ⫝̸)` for alternatives. Where `S` gives
scope to alternative-denoting expressions, `Option` gives scope to
presupposition triggers. Both derive exceptional scope from ASSOCIATIVITY.

## Organization

- **§1** Connectives on `Option Bool`: material conditional (middle Kleene),
        conjunction/disjunction (weak Kleene)
- **§2** The intensional-presuppositional monad `Iₚ` (= `ReaderT i Option`)
- **§3** Monad laws for `Iₚ`
- **§4** Semantic operations: evaluation `(·)^ž`, presuppositional universal `∀ₚ`
- **§5** Attitude verb semantics: `believe` via doxastic accessibility
- **§6** Bridge: `Option Bool ↔ Truth3 ↔ PrProp`

## The Maybe Monad as Presupposition

`Option` is already a `LawfulMonad` in Lean. Grove's operators are:

| Grove notation | Lean | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `η_#` | `some` | `α → Option α` |
| `⋆_#` | `Option.bind` | `Option α → (α → Option β) → Option β` |
| `#` | `none` | `Option α` |

The monad laws (Left Identity, Right Identity, Associativity from Figure 7)
hold definitionally.

## Parallel with the Set Monad

| | Alternatives ([charlow-2020]) | Presupposition ([grove-2022]) |
|---|---|---|
| Monad | `S α = α → Prop` (sets) | `Option α` (maybe) |
| Unit | `η_S(x) = {x}` | `η_#(v) = some v` |
| Bind | `m ⫝̸_S f = ⋃_{x∈m} f(x)` | `v ⋆_# k = k(v); # ⋆_# k = #` |
| Effect | Indeterminacy | Partiality |
| Scope | Indefinites escape islands | Presuppositions project past filters |

/-! ### §1 Connectives on `Option Bool`

Grove uses two distinct gap-propagation policies:

- **Middle Kleene** for the material conditional `⇒`: left-undefined absorbs,
  but right-undefined does NOT absorb when the left is false (`⊥ ⇒ # = ⊤`).
- **Weak Kleene** for `∀_#`: undefinedness absorbs from either side
  (`⊥ ∧ # = #`, unlike Strong Kleene where `⊥ ∧ # = ⊥`). -/

section Connectives

/-- Material conditional `⇒` with **middle Kleene** semantics (Grove eq. 16).

    `⊤ ⇒ ψ = ψ`, `⊥ ⇒ ψ = ⊤`, `# ⇒ ψ = #`.

    The conditional is true when its antecedent is false (regardless of
    the consequent's definedness), and propagates the consequent when the
    antecedent is true. Undefinedness in the antecedent absorbs. -/
def materialCond : Option Bool → Option Bool → Option Bool
  | none, _ => none
  | some false, _ => some true
  | some true, ψ => ψ

/-- **Weak Kleene** conjunction (used by `∀ₚ`).

    Undefinedness absorbs from either side, then falsity absorbs.
    In contrast, Strong Kleene has `⊥ ∧ # = ⊥`, while Weak Kleene
    has `⊥ ∧ # = #`. -/

/-! ### §2 The monad `Iₚ`

`Iₚ I α = I → Option α`: the Reader monad transformer applied to the
Maybe monad. An expression of type `Iₚ I α` reads an index (world,
world-assignment pair, etc.) and returns a possibly-undefined value.

This monad treats intensionality and presupposition uniformly
(Grove §4.1): `Iₚ` is obtained by replacing `t` with `t_#` in
standard intensional types (`i → t` becomes `i → t_#`). -/

section IMonad

/-- `Iₚ I α = I → Option α`: the Reader monad transformer over the Maybe
    monad. An expression of type `Iₚ I α` reads an index `i` (world,
    world-assignment pair, etc.) and returns `some v` if defined at `i`,
    or `none` on presupposition failure — Grove §4.1's uniform treatment
    of intensionality and presupposition (replacing `t` with `t_#` in the
    intensional type `i → t`).

    Defining `Iₚ` as `ReaderT I Option` makes `pure`/`>>=` Grove's
    `η_#`/`⋆_#` and inherits `Monad`/`LawfulMonad` from mathlib. -/
abbrev Iₚ (I : Type) := ReaderT I Option

end IMonad


/-! ### §3 Monad laws

`Iₚ = ReaderT I Option` is a `LawfulMonad`, so the three laws of Grove's
Figure 7 hold via `pure_bind`, `bind_pure`, and `bind_assoc` rather than
standalone `rfl` theorems. Left Identity and Associativity are the
scope-taking properties: Left Identity gives reconstruction (`η` + `⋆` =
no scope; Grove fn. 13), and Associativity makes cyclic scope-taking
(roll-up pied-piping) sound (the presuppositional analog of
[charlow-2020]'s ASSOCIATIVITY theorem for the set monad). -/


/-! ### §4 Evaluation and presuppositional universal

The evaluation function `evalI` (Grove's `(·)^ž`) converts an intension
that may be undefined into an intensional truth value that may be undefined,
by feeding the index to itself. The presuppositional universal `forallP`
(Grove's `∀_#`) quantifies over a domain with weak-Kleene semantics. -/

section Operations

variable {I : Type}

/-- Evaluation function `(·)^ž` (Grove eq. 20).

    Given `φ : Iₚ I (I → Bool)` (a proposition that reads an index, possibly
    undefined, to return an intension), `evalI φ` feeds the index to itself:
    `evalI φ i = (φ i).map (· i)`. -/
def evalI (φ : Iₚ I (I → Bool)) : Iₚ I Bool :=
  λ i => (φ i).map (· i)

/-- Presuppositional universal `∀_#` (Grove eq. 27).

    Uses weak Kleene semantics: `none` absorbs (if the scope is undefined
    at any value, the whole universal is undefined). -/

  xs.foldl (λ acc x => meetWK acc (φ x)) (some true)

    rw [h x List.mem_cons_self]
    exact ih (λ y hy => h y (List.mem_cons_of_mem x hy))

/-- Helper: folding `meetWK` with an element that maps to `none` yields `none`,
    regardless of the accumulator or subsequent elements. -/
private theorem foldl_meetWK_hits_none {α : Type}
    (pre : List α) (x : α) (post : List α) (φ : α → Option Bool)
    (acc : Option Bool) (hu : φ x = none) :
    (pre ++ x :: post).foldl (λ a y => meetWK a (φ y)) acc = none := by

    rw [hu]; exact meetWK_none_right _]
  exact foldl_meetWK_none post φ

/-- `forallP` with an undefined element is `none`.

    Since `meetWK` has `none` as a zero element, once any `φ(x) = none`
    is encountered, the accumulator becomes `none` and stays `none`. -/
theorem forallP_undef {α : Type} (xs : List α) (φ : α → Option Bool)

/-! ### §5 `believe` via doxastic accessibility

Grove §4.2 (eq. 28): `believe = λφ,x,i. ∀_# j : dox(x,i,j) ⇒ φ(j)`.
The verb quantifies over doxastically accessible worlds with `∀_#` and
uses the material conditional `⇒`. The `⇒` contributes the key
filtering behavior: when `dox(x,i,j) = false`, `⇒` returns `some true`
regardless of `φ(j)`'s definedness. -/

section AttitudeVerbs

variable {W E : Type}

/-- `believe` (Grove eq. 28).

    Given an accessibility relation `dox`, a list of worlds, a complement
    `φ : Iₚ W Bool`, an agent `x`, and an evaluation world `i`:
    `believe dox worlds φ x i = ∀_# j ∈ worlds : dox(x,i,j) ⇒ φ(j)` -/
def believe (dox : E → W → W → Bool) (worlds : List W)
    (φ : Iₚ W Bool) (x : E) : Iₚ W Bool :=
  λ i => forallP worlds (λ j => materialCond (some (dox x i j)) (φ j))
