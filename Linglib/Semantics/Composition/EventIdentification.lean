# Event Identification

This file defines Event Identification, the composition principle by which Kratzer adds an
argument-introducing head to a predicate of events. The head denotes a relation between
individuals and events, the predicate a set of events, and the two combine by conjunction at the
event, leaving the individual argument open: an agent head and *feed the dog* yield the relation
that holds of an individual and an event when the individual is the agent of the event and the
event is a feeding of the dog. Event Identification is meet with the predicate lifted to a
relation constant in the individual, so it is the relational counterpart of predicate
modification, and repeated applications chain conditions on the same event.

## Main definitions

* `Semantics.Composition.eventIdentification`: the combination of a relation and a predicate.

## Main results

* `eventIdentification_eq_inf`, `eventIdentification_eq_comp`: Event Identification is meet
  with the lifted predicate, and predicate modification of each section of the relation.
* `eventIdentification_eventIdentification`: two applications conjoin the predicates.
* `eventIdentification_eq_bot_iff`: the result is empty exactly when, for every individual, the
  relation's events and the predicate's are disjoint.

## Implementation notes

Kratzer's rule is partial: it is undefined when the two inputs restrict the event to disjoint
sorts, actions and states. Here it is total, and such inputs yield the empty relation
(`eventIdentification_eq_bot_iff`). The carrier is any pair of types, so that the type-driven
composition engine, whose events share the domain of individuals, uses the same operation.
