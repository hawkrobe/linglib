# Belief and complement worlds

The world space of the *know*/*think* projection experiments: a world records whether the
attitude holder believes the complement and whether the complement is true. *Know* holds at a
world when both do and *think* when the first does, so *know* entails the complement and
entails *think*, the factive against non-factive contrast of [kiparsky-kiparsky-1970]. The two
questions of the experiments ask for the two coordinates, and a speaker assumes the complement
when it is true throughout an information state.
