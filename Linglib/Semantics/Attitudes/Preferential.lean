# Degree semantics for preferential predicates

A preferential predicate such as *hope*, *fear* or *be happy* compares the degree to which its
subject prefers a proposition with a threshold set by a comparison class `C`, in the degree
semantics of Villalta that Romero and Uegaki and Sudo build on. Relating an agent to a set of
propositions, the answers of a question or the singleton of a declarative's proposition, it holds
when some proposition of the set lies in the comparison class and is preferred above the
threshold. The predicate is therefore clausally distributive, and when the comparison class lies
inside the question it asserts only that the threshold is significant on the class, which is how
Uegaki and Sudo derive the anti-rogativity of *hope*.

## Main definitions

* `Preferential.preferred`: the members of the comparison class preferred above its threshold.
* `Preferential.degreeComparison`: the denotation of a degree-comparison predicate.

## Main statements

* `Preferential.isDistributive_degreeComparison`: degree comparison is clausally distributive.
* `Preferential.degreeComparison_iff_thresholdSignificant`: with the comparison class inside the
  question, the predicate asserts that its threshold is significant.

## Implementation notes

Degrees live in any linear order. The degree of preference depends on the world of evaluation, as
Uegaki and Sudo's `Pref_w` does; for a negative predicate such as *fear* it measures dispreference.
Which predicates presuppose that the threshold is significant is left to the studies, since
Uegaki and Sudo take all preferentials to and Qing and colleagues only the positive ones.
