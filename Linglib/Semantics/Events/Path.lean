# Spatial paths

A path is a finite sequence of locations, the spatial counterpart of a temporal interval. Zwarts
gives paths an algebra: concatenation, defined only when one path ends where the next starts, the
subpath order, and Krifka's adjacency of paths that share an endpoint. Zwarts's own paths are
continuous curves, mathlib's topological `_root_.Path`, but he allows sequences of places as
compatible with the algebra, and they keep every operation computable.

Pantcheva classifies paths by where they are inside a region. On any path parametrized by a
bounded linear order of positions, a sequence of places or a curve, the positions inside the
region form a set, and its order-theoretic shape is the path's: an upper set for a cofinal path
(*to*), a lower set for a coinitial one (*from*), an interval missing both ends for a transitive
one (*past*), the last position alone for a terminative one (*up to*). Reparametrizing keeps the
shape and reversing the order reverses it, so a source path is a reversed goal path. An event
domain's spatial trace sends each event to the path it traverses, as its temporal trace sends it
to its run time.

## Main definitions

* `Spatial.Path`: a directed trajectory, a source with later steps, ending at `Path.goal`.
* `Spatial.Path.IsConcat`, `Subpath`, `adjacent`, `reverse`: the path algebra.
* `Spatial.Path.Direction`: Place, Goal, Source and Route, in containment order.
* `Spatial.Path.Shape`, `Shape.direction`, `Shape.transition`: the eight shapes.
* `Spatial.Path.IsCofinal`, `IsCoinitial`, `IsTransitive`, `IsTerminative`, `IsEgressive`,
  `IsProlative`, `IsApproximative`, `IsRecessive`, `HasShape`: the shapes of a parametrized
  path relative to a region.
* `Spatial.Path.toFun`: a path's places indexed by their positions.
* `Spatial.Localization`: interior, surface or exterior.
* `Event.SpatialTrace`: the spatial trace of an event domain.

## Main results

* `Spatial.Path.Direction.lt_iff_shells_ssubset`: the containment order is strict inclusion of
  head stacks.
* `Spatial.Path.Shape.exists_direction_transition_iff`: a direction and a transition combine
  into a shape exactly when the direction is not Place and a route is not delimited.
* `Spatial.Path.hasShape_comp`, `hasShape_comp_ofDual`: reparametrizing keeps the shape, and
  traversing the other way reverses it.
* `Spatial.Path.hasShape_reverse`: reversing a path reverses its shape.
* `Spatial.Path.IsCofinal.not_isCoinitial`: no path is both cofinal and coinitial.
