# Closure of the eventuality argument

A clause denotes a world-indexed predicate of eventualities until some head closes the
eventuality argument existentially. Accounts of complement choice differ on the head:
[grano-2024] makes it mood, the indicative closing the argument and one subjunctive passing it
up, while [fusco-sgrizzi-2026] make it a head that a clause-sized infinitive contains and a
smaller one lacks. They agree on why it matters. The content of an intention is causally
self-referential ([searle-1983], [harman-1976]): it is satisfied only by an eventuality that the
intention itself brings about. Such content closes the argument over the eventualities the
attitude state causes, which needs the open predicate and cannot be computed from the closed
proposition.

## Main declarations

* `Event.closure`: existential closure of the eventuality argument.
* `Event.causedClosure`: closure over the eventualities a given state causes, the causally
  self-referential prejacent.

## Main statements

* `Event.causedClosure_factorsThrough_iff`: the causally self-referential prejacent is a function
  of the closed proposition exactly when causation by the state is trivial at every world,
  relating the state to every eventuality or to none.

## Implementation notes

Causation is a relation `cause s e w` between two eventualities and a world, as both papers write
it. For a fixed world `causedClosure` is the preimage of the complement's eventualities under the
causal relation, mathlib's `SetRel.preimage`; the relation is kept as a function because it is
only ever applied, and the lemmas follow the names of the `SetRel.preimage` API.
