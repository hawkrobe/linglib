# Pre-existence

An individual pre-exists a time when its time span, the run time of an event or the life span of
an entity, starts before that time. [bondarenko-2020] derives the factive inference of Buryat
*hanaxa* 'think' with a nominal complement from a presupposition that the complement describes
something that pre-exists the thinking, and [williams-2025] places a covert modal under English
*forget* exactly where the complement would otherwise contradict the same presupposition.

Pre-existence entails existence (`Event.PreExists.exists`), which is how it yields a factive
inference. What it adds depends on where a description locates its individuals: one that
locates them before the time pre-exists it as soon as it describes anything
(`Event.preExists_iff_exists_of_precedes`), and one that locates them within the time never does
(`Event.not_preExists_of_le`).

[bondarenko-2020] takes the presupposition to come from the head that introduces a verb's
internal argument, which also gives verbs of destruction and use theirs (*Sue broke a vase*), so
it is not specific to attitude verbs.

## Main definitions

* `Event.PreExists τ Q a`: some individual of `Q` has a time span starting before `a`.

## Main statements

* `Event.PreExists.exists`: pre-existence entails existence.
* `Event.preExists_iff_exists_of_precedes`, `Event.not_preExists_of_le`: pre-existence under
  descriptions that locate their individuals before, or within, a time.

## Implementation notes

The time spans are given by a function `τ` into `NonemptyInterval`, as an event's run time
(`Event.τ`) or an entity's life span. Pre-existence compares left boundaries only, and leaves the
right boundary free, so an individual can outlast the time it pre-exists ([bondarenko-2020]'s
(10)).
