# Distinguishing descriptions

A description distinguishes its referent from a contrast set when its compatibility with the
referent strictly exceeds its compatibility with every distractor, compatibility taking values
in a preorder. At truth values this is the distinguishing description of [dale-reiter-1995],
which holds of the referent and of no distractor, and the Russellian uniqueness of
`Reference.russellIota` over the domain the contrast set restricts. Under a graded semantics it
says the referent is the literal listener's best guess, since a strictly monotone rescaling of
compatibility such as the listener's normalization does not change it
(`RSA.distinguishes_literalListener_uniformOn_iff`). A graded description
distinguishes exactly when some level set of its compatibility does, so the truth-valued notion
is the general one at a threshold.

## Main definitions

* `Reference.Distinguishes compat C r d`: the compatibility of `d` with `r` strictly exceeds its
  compatibility with every member of `C`.

## Main results

* `distinguishes_prop_iff`: at truth values, `d` holds of `r` and of no distractor.
* `distinguishes_iff_russellIota`, `distinguishes_univ_erase_iff`: identification is the
  definite's uniqueness on the domain, and `r` is the whole extension against everything else.
* `distinguishes_comp_iff`: invariance under strictly monotone rescaling of compatibility.
* `distinguishes_iff_exists_threshold`: a graded compatibility distinguishes exactly when some
  threshold of it does.
