# The context of utterance

The context of utterance of [kaplan-1989], a tuple of an agent, a world, a time and a
position, with the addressee of [speas-tenny-2003] as a fifth coordinate. A context is
*proper* when its agent exists at its world (`Context.Proper`), which validates *I exist*, and
*located* when its agent is at its position at its time in its world (`Context.Located`),
which validates *I am here now*. The world and time of a context form its index of evaluation
(`Context.toIndex`), and replacing them by another index (`Context.shiftWorldTime`) is the
shift to an alternative situation that keeps the agent fixed, used to quantify a concept
across a believer's alternatives.
