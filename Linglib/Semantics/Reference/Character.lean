# Characters

A *character* is a function from contexts to contents, a content being an intension from
worlds to extensions: the two-stage semantics of [kaplan-1989], on which the linguistic
meaning of an expression fixes, at each context of utterance, what the expression says there.
A character is *directly referential* when its content at every context is rigid
(`Character.IsDirectlyReferential`). Kaplan's rigidifier `dthat` makes a directly referential
character out of any context-dependent choice of individual (`Character.dthat`): the pure
indexicals are its instances at a coordinate of the context, and `dthat` of a description
evaluated at the context world is Kaplan's `dthat[the φ]`. A proper name has the constant
character (`Character.const`), rigid also as a function of the context in the sense of
`IsRigid`.
