# The denotation of a determiner

The determiner records of `Syntax/Category/Determiner/Basic.lean` denote `Nominal`s, in parallel
with the pronouns of `Semantics/Reference/Pronoun.lean`:

| | pronoun | determiner |
|---|---|---|
| lexical record | `PersonalPronoun` | `Article`, `DemonstrativeDeterminer` |
| selector | `interpPronoun` (`g ↦ g i`) | `⟦k⟧` for a `Description` `k` |
| intrinsic presupposition | φ-domain (`phiDom`) | vicinity of the anchors (`χ.image`) |

The selector is the description's denotation, so a determiner and its description pick the same
individual by construction. A demonstrative's deictic content projects as its intrinsic
presupposition, so deixis filters the referent but never selects it
(`DemonstrativeDeterminer.denote_selector_eq_anaphoric`). Following Harbour's spatial head χ, the
presupposition is that the referent lies in the vicinity of a referent whose participants form one
of the demonstrative's participant sets: the χ-image of the preimage of those sets under
`Reference.Context.participants`. For the first person's sets that preimage is the first person's
φ-domain, and for the other persons' sets it is their φ-domain less the more prominent ones'.

## Main declarations

* `Description.toNominal`: a description's `Nominal`, with vacuous intrinsic presupposition.
* `DemonstrativeDeterminer.denote`: the demonstrative's `Nominal`.
* `Article.toDescriptions`, `Article.denotations`: an article's possible descriptions, one per
  admissible strength, and their `Nominal`s; a syncretic article (English *the*) denotes both the
  weak and the strong description.
* `PossessiveDeterminer.denote`: the possessive determiner's `Nominal`, the unique satisfier of
  the possessee restrictor that stands in the possession relation to the possessor.
* `Description.denote_possessive_eq_pi`, `PossessiveDeterminer.denote_isSome_iff_existsUnique`:
  the possessive determiner's denotation is Barker's `π` applied to the possessor, with
  definedness as its presupposition.

## Implementation notes

Context is the entity assignment `Assignment E` and the world coordinate is the resource situation
`W`, as for `PersonalPronoun.denote`. A demonstrative also reads the context of utterance, whose
agent and addressee fix the participants of a referent, and a vicinity relation `χ : SetRel E E`.
Harbour leaves the anchoring referent free; the presupposition closes it existentially, his reading
of English *here* as the vicinity of any group containing the speaker. A demonstrative without a
deictic contrast covers every participant set and so presupposes only that its referent lies in some
vicinity: its deictic centre is the whole discourse space, as Terenghi puts it. Harbour's (16) and
Moroney's (147)–(148) put the deictic condition inside the restriction, where it can select among
the restrictor's satisfiers; here it is a presupposition on the indexed referent of the
strong-article description, and the two coincide whenever the index supplies a referent that meets
the condition. Distance, visibility and elevation, which cross-cut the person cells, are not
modeled. `Quantifier`, a generalized quantifier rather than an individual denotation, has no
`Nominal`.

/-! ### Unification with the possessive description

The possessive determiner's denotation (`Description.possessive`/`iota`) and the
`Possession` description are not two analyses — they are the same construction. The
determiner's restrictor *is* Barker's `Possession.π` of the noun predicate and the possession
relation, applied to the possessor, and its definedness presupposition *is* the description's
Russellian uniqueness condition. -/
