# Semantic universals for modal meanings

This file defines the two proposed universals on modal meanings, sets of force-flavor pairs, as
predicates on a `Finset ForceFlavor`, and the weaker property proposed as a fallback. A meaning has
independent force and flavor when it is the product of its forces and its flavors
([steinert-threlkeld-imel-guo-2023]), it varies on a single axis when its pairs all share a
force or all share a flavor ([nauze-2008]), and it is path-connected when any two of its pairs
recombine in at least one order. A single-axis meaning is a product, and a product is
path-connected.

On a Kratzer semantics ([kratzer-1981]) a modal's force and its flavor are set by separate
parameters, so its meaning is a product and satisfies the universal; a fixed-force modal ranging
over flavors, or a variable-force modal of one flavor, varies on a single axis besides.

## Main definitions

* `Modality.ForceFlavorIndependent`: the meaning is the product of its projections.
* `Modality.SingleAxis`: at most one force or at most one flavor.
* `Modality.PathConnected`: closure under recombining two pairs in at least one order.

## Main results

* `Modality.forceFlavorIndependent_iff`: the universal as stated, closure under
  recombining the force of one pair with the flavor of another.
* `Modality.forceFlavorIndependent_iff_pair_product_subset`: independence is convexity
  for the grid betweenness of [chemla-buccola-dautriche-2019].
* `Modality.SingleAxis.forceFlavorIndependent`,
  `Modality.ForceFlavorIndependent.pathConnected`: the three properties in order of
  strength.
* `Modality.forceFlavorIndependent_product`: a product meaning satisfies the universal.
* `Modality.ModalItem.singleAxis_meaning_iff`: an item varies on a single axis when it does not
  vary in both force and flavor.
