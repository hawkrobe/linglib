# Event-relative modality

This file defines the binders of a modal's event variable and quantification over the content
of an event, the two ingredients of Hacquard's event-relative semantics for modals. In that
semantics a modal's domain is projected from an event rather than fixed by the context of
utterance. The modal's event variable is bound by the closest binder
above it: aspect binds a modal below AspP to the event the verb phrase describes, and a modal
above AspP is bound to the speech event in a matrix clause and to the attitude event in the
complement of an attitude verb. Speech and attitude events have propositional content, the set
of worlds compatible with what is asserted or believed, and a modal anchored to such an event
can quantify over that content. Content is a property of the event and not of its binder: most
verb phrases describe events without content, but an aspect-bound modal over an attitude
predicate is anchored to a contentful event and again has a reading over its content.

## Main definitions

* `Modality.EventBinder`: the three events a modal's event variable can be bound to.
* `Modality.ModalPosition`: the position of a modal relative to aspect, with the binders
  `ModalPosition.matrixBinder` and `ModalPosition.embeddedBinder` that position determines.
* `Modality.contentNecessity`, `Modality.contentPossibility`: quantification over the content of
  the anchoring event, undefined (false) when the event has none.

## Main statements

* `Modality.contentNecessity_const`, `Modality.contentPossibility_const`: over a proposition
  that does not vary with the world, the quantifier contributes only the consistency of the
  content. A modal anchored to the event that embeds it is therefore vacuous.

## Implementation notes

The content of an event is a function `con : E → Option (Set W)`, the worlds compatible with
the event's content where it has one. Ordering sources play no role in content licensing and
are left to `Semantics/Modality/Kratzer`, whose operators apply to a base `f e` projected from
an event as they do to any other.
