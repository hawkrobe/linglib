# Meanings with alternatives

A meaning in alternative semantics is a pair: an ordinary denotation, and a set of alternatives
that focus features and operators manipulate while leaving the ordinary denotation alone.
`WithAlternatives` is that pair. It is the product of the identity monad and the set monad, so the
two-dimensional recursion of alternative semantics is `<$>` and `<*>` of a lawful `Monad`, and the
two dimensions are its two monad morphisms.

Symmetry-based refinements live in `Symmetric.lean`, structural alternatives in `Structural.lean`,
and the semantics of the focus and givenness features in `Semantics/Focus/`.

## Main definitions

* `WithAlternatives` — an ordinary value together with the alternatives it evokes
* `WithAlternatives.WellFormed` — the containment constraint: the alternatives include the
  ordinary value
* `WithAlternatives.Given` — the alternatives have collapsed to a singleton

## Main results

* `ordinary_seq`, `mem_alternatives_seq` — the two dimensions of Hamblin composition
* `alternatives_seq` — the alternatives of an application are those of the `Set` applicative
* `Given.alternatives_seq` — a Given function contributes only its ordinary value

/-! ### The composition engine

Alternative semantics composes pointwise: the ordinary values apply to each other while the
alternatives collect applications of alternative functions to alternative arguments (Hamblin
functional application). `pure` is `unfeatured` and `<$>`/`<*>` are the recursive clauses of the
two-dimensional semantics. -/

With the laws above these exhibit the monad as a span `Id ⟵ WithAlternatives ⟶ Set`: ordinary
denotation and alternative set are its two structure-preserving projections. -/
