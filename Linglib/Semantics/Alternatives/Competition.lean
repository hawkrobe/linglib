# Pragmatic competition

An expression is blocked when one of its alternatives is strictly stronger along a dimension of
content, and it survives competition at a point where its content holds and no alternative whose
content also holds there is strictly stronger. `Blocked` is the first relation and `unblocked`
the set of points of the second, for any alternative source `S → Set S` and content function
`S → Set W`; `sameAssertion` keeps the alternatives with the same at-issue content.

Along at-issue content over the weakly assertable alternatives, blocking is Katzir's
neo-Gricean principle, and along conventional-implicature content it is Lo Guercio's Maximize
Conventional Implicatures. Along presuppositional content over `sameAssertion` it is Heim's
Maximize Presupposition, and its condition at a context, as Schlenker states it, is
`unblocked`: the presupposition less the presuppositions of the strictly stronger alternatives,
whose removal is Percus's anti-presupposition and Sauerland's implicated presupposition. The
relations carry no theory of why competition obtains, so pragmatic and grammatical accounts of
each principle state their disagreement over one definition.

## Main definitions

* `Alternatives.Blocked`: some alternative is strictly stronger along the content dimension.
* `Alternatives.unblocked`: the points where no alternative whose content holds is strictly
  stronger.
* `Alternatives.sameAssertion`: the alternatives with the same at-issue content.

## Main results

* `Alternatives.mem_unblocked_iff_minimalFor`: an expression is unblocked where it is a most
  specific competitor whose content holds.
* `Alternatives.disjoint_unblocked`: competitors with strictly nested contents are never
  unblocked at the same point.
* `Alternatives.unblocked_anti`: more alternatives, fewer unblocked points.
