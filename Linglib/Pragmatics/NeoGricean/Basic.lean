# Neo-Gricean pragmatics: secondary implicatures and the Standard Recipe

This file defines [sauerland-2004]'s derivation of secondary implicatures and the Standard
Recipe of [geurts-2010]. A speaker's epistemic state is a set of worlds `s : Set W` (the same
object as the `ContextSet` of `Discourse/CommonGround.lean`), and an *epistemic proposition* —
what an utterance implicates about the speaker — is a set of states `Set (Set W)`. Knowledge
`Kφ` is the principal down-set `Set.Iic φ` (the states `s ⊆ φ`), so the primary implicature
`¬Kψ` is `(Iic ψ)ᶜ`, the secondary implicature `K¬ψ` is `Iic ψᶜ`, competence `Kψ ∨ K¬ψ` is
`Iic ψ ∪ Iic ψᶜ`, and the empty state, a member of every `Iic`, is the inconsistent speaker.
Asserting `φ` against alternatives `alts` commits the speaker to `Kφ` and the primary
implicatures; `K¬ψ` is a secondary implicature iff it is consistent with that commitment.

## Main definitions

* `primaryImplicature`, `secondaryImplicature`, `competent`: the epistemic propositions
  `¬Kψ`, `K¬ψ`, `Kψ ∨ K¬ψ`.
* `commitment`: `Kφ` together with the primary implicatures of the alternatives.
* `Consistent`: an epistemic proposition holds of some nonempty state.
* `IsSecondaryImplicature`: [sauerland-2004]'s condition for `K¬ψ`.

## Main results

* `isSecondaryImplicature_iff`: `K¬ψ` is a secondary implicature iff the strengthened meaning
  `φ \ ψ` is consistent and entails no alternative — `φ \ ψ` itself is the canonical witness,
  so a blocked secondary implicature is always blocked by a single primary; the disjunction
  case (K¬(A∧B) arises, K¬A is blocked) is `Studies/Sauerland2004.lean`.
* `isSecondaryImplicature_of_ssubset`: a lone asymmetrically stronger alternative always yields
  its secondary implicature.
* `primaryImplicature_inter_competent`: the Standard Recipe as an identity — on consistent
  states, the weak implicature plus competence is the strong implicature.

/-! ### Primary and secondary implicatures

Asserting `φ` against scalar alternatives `alts` commits the speaker to `Kφ` plus the primary
implicature `¬Kψ` for each alternative ([sauerland-2004] (42), verified p. 383); `K¬ψ` is a
secondary implicature exactly when it is *consistent* with that commitment
([sauerland-2004] (43)). -/

/-- The speaker's commitment after asserting `φ` against `alts`: `Kφ` and the primary
implicature of each alternative. Per [sauerland-2004] the alternatives are the asymmetrically
stronger ones (`ψ ⊂ φ`); the definition does not enforce the filter. -/

is support of the polar question `Question.polar ψ` by `Question.mem_polar`. -/
