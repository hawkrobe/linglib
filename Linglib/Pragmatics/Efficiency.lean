# Communicative efficiency

This file defines the scalarization of a pair of communicative costs by a tradeoff parameter and
the deviation of an attested encoding from the efficient frontier.

Many linguistic phenomena arise from a tension between two functional pressures, and attested
forms tend to be efficient compromises between them. A `CostPair` records the two costs. In the
work of Xu and colleagues they are speaker effort, measured by word length, and information loss,
measured by listener surprisal. For Kemp and Regier they are complexity and loss of
informativeness, and for Zaslavsky and colleagues they are the complexity `I(W;U)` and the
distortion `D[p‖q]` of an information bottleneck. The weighted cost `L_β = cost₂ + β · cost₁`
trades one against the other, and the efficiency loss of an attested pair is its least deviation,
over a list of values of `β`, from the pair that is optimal at that `β`.

## Main definitions

* `CostPair`: a pair of costs, such as effort and information loss.
* `weightedCost`: the linear scalarization `L_β = cost₂ + β · cost₁`.
* `efficiencyLossAt`: the deviation from the optimal pair at one `β`.
* `efficiencyLoss`: the least deviation across a list of values of `β`.

## Main results

* `frontier_antitone`: optimal pairs move along the frontier as `β` grows, with smaller `cost₁`
  and larger `cost₂`.
* `efficiencyLoss_nonneg`: the efficiency loss against optimal pairs is nonnegative.
