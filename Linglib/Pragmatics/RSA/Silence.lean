# Silence as a null alternative
[bergen-levy-goodman-2016]

`WithSilence U := Option U` is the standard wrapper that adds a "silence"
element to any utterance type: `none` is silence, `some u` a paper-utterance.
`liftMeaning` gives silence universal extension — true at every world —
following the null utterance of [bergen-levy-goodman-2016], which is true in
every world so that the speaker always has an honest option.

**Deviation from the source**: [bergen-levy-goodman-2016] disfavor their null
utterance by *cost* (it is the most expensive alternative), and observe that a
sufficiently cheap null utterance *is* used in the fully ignorant knowledge
state. This costless rendering disfavors silence by informativity alone:
universal extension gives it the smallest literal-listener value (`1/card W`
under the `extensionOf`-based literal listener), so the softmax speaker
prefers any honest informative utterance, and silence absorbs all probability
exactly where none exists. That dissolves the "no `qOk` witness" defect that
would otherwise make some observation cells vacuous in PMF formalizations of
[goodman-stuhlmuller-2013]-style models (whose own utterance sets have no
null utterance).

## Main definitions

- `WithSilence U` — `Option U`, where `none` = silence.
- `liftMeaning m` — extends `m : U → W → Prop` to `WithSilence U → W → Prop`,
  with silence true at every world.
- `extensionOf_liftMeaning_none` — silence's extension is the whole world
  space.

## Per-paper specialisations

The "cover hypothesis is universally satisfied because silence is always
`qOk`" theorem is paper-specific (because `qOk` depends on the paper's
observation type and compatibility predicate). Each consumer paper proves
its own `cover_silent` as a 1-line application of `liftMeaning_none`.

/-! ### Costed silence

[bergen-levy-goodman-2016] disfavor the null utterance by *cost*: the speaker
utility is informativity minus cost, so the softmax weight factors as
`L0 ^ α · exp (−α·c)` — a per-utterance cost factor, the slot `RSA.S1Belief`
already carries. `liftCostFactor` extends a content-utterance cost factor to
`WithSilence U` with a designated silence weight `κ`: silence maximally
expensive (`κ` minimal) recovers the regime of [bergen-levy-goodman-2016],
where silence is a never-preferred honesty fallback; silence free with costly
speech gives the decision-to-speak regime of [rohde-etal-2022], where
*whether* the speaker talks is itself informative. -/
