# Number resolution

A target agreeing with all of its conjoined noun phrases takes the number its language gives the
group they form, in Slovene the dual for two singulars and the plural otherwise. Corbett observes
that the values resolution produces match the semantics of number. A system with determinate
values gives a referent of `n` individuals the determinate value of that cardinality if it has
one and the plural otherwise, and the conjuncts denote distinct individuals, so the group's
cardinality is the sum of theirs. When the determinate values form an initial segment of
singular, dual and trial, as the implicational universals require, the value of the sum depends
only on the values of the parts, so resolution is a function of the conjuncts' numbers. The same
classification gives the number of a target whose system lacks its controller's value, the
plural of a Modern Hebrew verb agreeing with a dual noun.

## Main definitions

* `Number.System.ofCard`: the value a system gives a referent of `n` individuals.
* `Number.System.resolve`: the resolved number of two conjuncts.
* `Number.System.coarsen`: the value a system gives the referent of another system's value.

## Main results

* `Number.System.resolve_ofCard`: in a system obeying DU → SG and TR → DU, conjuncts of `m`
  and `n` individuals resolve to the value of `m + n`.
* `Number.System.foldl_resolve_ofCard`: any number of conjuncts resolve to the value of the sum
  of their cardinalities.
* `Number.System.resolve_card_union`: conjuncts denoting disjoint pluralities resolve to the
  value of their sum.
* `Number.System.coarsen_ofCard`: a target shows the value of its controller's referent when
  the controller's system has every determinate value of the target's.

## Implementation notes

That resolution is a function of the conjuncts' numbers says that `ofCard`'s kernel is a
congruence for addition on positive cardinalities, the additive counterpart of the person
systems' congruences for union; no consumer reads the quotient, so it is not built. The
approximative values have no fixed cardinality boundary and the minimal and augmented are
relative to person, so neither are classes of cardinalities. `resolve` and `coarsen` send them,
as they send the plural, to the plural; no theorem here reaches them.

## TODO

* Minimal–augmented systems, where the speaker and the addressee, each minimal, sum to the
  minimal inclusive, want person and number resolved together.
