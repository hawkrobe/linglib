# Inverse number

Kiowa-Tanoan verbal agreement distinguishes singular, dual, plural and *inverse*. Inverse is
not a number value alongside the others ([corbett-2000], §5.5: inverse systems "are a matter of
morphological arrangement and not of semantic values"); on [harbour-2011]'s analysis it is what
a D head shows when its `[±atomic]` and `[±minimal]` features are valued from two sources, the
noun's inherent number and its natural number, and one feature receives both values. A
`Valuation` records the values each feature has received, `Valuation.agree` merges an inherent
and a natural valuation, and `Valuation.category` reads off the agreement category: inverse iff
some feature is valued both ways, otherwise the number the values spell.
