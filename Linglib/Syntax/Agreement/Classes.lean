# Agreement classes and target genders

This file defines the agreement classes of a language's nouns and the target genders of its
agreement targets, and classifies the map between the target genders of two numbers.

An agreement class is a set of nouns that take the same agreement forms on every target in
every morphosyntactic form, and the controller genders of a language are its agreement
classes. A target gender is a form an agreeing target distinguishes, and there may be fewer
target genders than controller genders: Romanian has three of the latter over two of the
former in each number. The target genders of the singular and the plural determine one
another, as in French, the singular's determine the plural's without the converse, as in
German, or neither determines the other, as in Romanian or Lak.

## Main definitions

* `Gender.agreementClasses`: the kernel of the noun-level agreement map.
* `Gender.targetGenders`: the range of the agreement map restricted to one target.
* `Gender.Parallel`, `Gender.Convergent`, `Gender.Crossed`: the map between the target
  genders of two numbers, as each factors through the other or not.
* `Gender.Polar`: an exponent of two features whose polar opposites coincide.

## Main results

* `Gender.card_quotient_agreementClasses`: the controller genders are as many as the
  agreement map has values.
* `Gender.card_range_le_prod`: the controller genders are at most the product over the
  targets of the target genders.
* `Gender.agreementClasses_eq_ker_of_faithful`: when a faithful carrier mediates
  agreement, the agreement classes are the fibres of the assignment.
* `Gender.parallel_iff_ker_eq`, `Gender.convergent_iff_ker_lt`: the map between two numbers'
  target genders is the order of their kernels.
* `Gender.Polar.card_le_two`, `Gender.Polar.parallel`: polarity forces two-valued features
  and is a parallel system.

## Implementation notes

* The index `T` of the agreement map is whatever the map is restricted to: a target
  category, a morphosyntactic form, or a pair of the two, so that target genders can be
  counted per target as well as per number across targets.
* Subgenders, agreement classes differing on a minority of forms, inquorate genders, small
  closed classes whose pattern mixes other genders, and overdifferentiated targets are the
  steps from agreement classes to controller genders that remain to be defined; until then
  the agreement classes of a fragment are its controller genders only when the fragment
  records no such class.

/-! ### Polarity

A fusional exponent of two features, gender and number in the Somali article, is polar when
changing either value alone changes the form and changing both restores it, so that the polar
opposites are identical ([corbett-1991] chapter 7; [corbett-1998]). A polar exponent is
syncretic across the numbers and within neither, so it is a parallel system, and it confines
both features to two values. -/
