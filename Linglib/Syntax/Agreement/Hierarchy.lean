# The Agreement Hierarchy

This file defines the four positions of Corbett's Agreement Hierarchy, the attributive
modifier, the predicate, the relative pronoun and the personal pronoun, as a chain with the
attributive on top; the availability of semantic agreement at a position; the hybrid nouns
whose availability varies from position to position; and what it is for a map along a
hierarchy to respect it.

A target agrees syntactically when its form follows the feature value the controller is
assigned, and semantically when it follows the controller's meaning. A hybrid noun, such as
Russian *vrač* 'doctor' denoting a woman or British English *committee*, admits both at some
positions, and the Agreement Hierarchy predicts that the likelihood of semantic agreement
never decreases from the attributive towards the personal pronoun, so a map respects the
hierarchy when it is antitone on the positions where it is recorded. A finite verb agrees at
the predicate position; Comrie's Predicate Hierarchy, which grades the verb, participle,
adjective and noun within the predicate, is `Corbett2000.PredicateTarget`.

## Main definitions

* `Agreement.Position`: the four positions, a chain lifted along `Position.rank`.
* `Agreement.Kind`: syntactic or semantic agreement.
* `Agreement.Availability`: the five degrees of availability of semantic agreement, from
  syntactic only to semantic only, linearly ordered.
* `Agreement.RespectsHierarchy`: a map recorded at some positions of a hierarchy is
  antitone where it is recorded.
* `Agreement.Hybrid`: a hybrid noun, the availability of semantic agreement at the
  positions of a hierarchy for which there are data.

## Implementation notes

`RespectsHierarchy` takes any preorder of positions and any preorder of values, so that it
serves the Agreement Hierarchy on `Position`, the Predicate Hierarchy on the sub-positions of
the predicate, and refinements of the attributive position alike, and corpus proportions of
semantic agreement as well as availabilities. A position carrying no value is skipped: values
are compared only across comparable positions that both carry one.
