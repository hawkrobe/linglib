# Polar interrogatives and their answers

This file formalizes the syntax of yes–no questions and their answers of [holmberg-2016]. A
`PolarInterrogative` is a sentence radical, its positive alternative, with a `ClauseNegation`,
the negation of the clause, if any, with its height relative to the polarity head. Its primary
alternative is the radical under the polarity the negation gives it, and it denotes the polar
question of that alternative; a negative interrogative and its positive counterpart denote the
same question, differing only in which alternative is primary
(`PolarInterrogative.denote_eq_polar_radical`), whose alternatives are the polarity alternatives
of the radical (`PolarInterrogative.alt_denote`).

The polarity head is merged unvalued, and a short answer merges a focused valued polarity
feature, spelled out by an answer particle, with the clause inherited from the question,
normally elided. An `AnswerFeature` is that feature: a valued [+Pol] or [−Pol], or the
affirmative [+Pol, REV] of a polarity-reversing particle such as Swedish *jo*, which eliminates
the negation in the answer. Given the negation of the clause the answer inherits,
`AnswerFeature.answer` computes the polarity
of the alternative the answer confirms, relative to the question's positive alternative, or
`none` for an ill-formed answer; the action of `Polarity` on propositions turns that polarity
into the alternative itself.

A negation out of the polarity head's reach, such as a low, VP-internal one, leaves the particle
to value the head, and the value composes with the negation: an affirmative particle confirms
the negative alternative, a negative one is a double negation. A middle negation values the head
itself: a negative particle agrees with it and a plain affirmative clashes with it.

The answers a feature gives to the questions whose negations a language allows form a set of
`Discourse.Response`s (`AnswerFeature.responses`), the carrier of the polarity features of
[farkas-bruce-2010], to whom [holmberg-2016] credits REV: a reversing feature gives exactly the
[reverse, +] answers (`AnswerFeature.responses_reversing`). The systems for answering negative
questions are properties of these sets (`Discourse.Response.ConfirmsNegativeQuestion`), and the
mechanism derives them from the height of the negation: the affirmative feature confirms the
negative alternative just when the negation is low, the truth-based system
(`AnswerFeature.confirmsNegativeQuestion_responses_positive_iff`), and the negative feature just
when it is middle, the polarity-based system
(`AnswerFeature.confirmsNegativeQuestion_responses_negative_iff`); after a high negation neither
does, the question being answered like a neutral one.

## Implementation notes

* What decides the system is whether the negation can value the polarity head
  (`ClauseNegation.ValuesHead`); the height of the negation matters only through that
  ([holmberg-2016] on Thai, whose negation cannot value the head from inside the complement of
  the question particle). Heights classify constructions, not languages: English *not* is read
  low by some speakers and middle by others, and *-n't* in positive-bias questions is high.
* REV needs a negation in the answer to eliminate, so a reversing particle is ill formed after a
  neutral or a positive-bias question. Colloquial Swedish, where *jo* can confirm the positive
  alternative of any yes–no question ([holmberg-2016], footnote to the section on positive and
  negative bias), is not modelled.
* The two versions of the negative particle in polarity-based languages, an interpretable one
  valuing the head and an uninterpretable one agreeing with a negation that values it, are one
  `AnswerFeature.value .negative`, whose agreement is built into `AnswerFeature.answer`.
* The reading of a polar interrogative is an `Option Polarity`: `none` for a positive question,
  and for a negative one the polarity of the proposition it double-checks, relative to its
  radical: [ladd-1981]'s outer reading, double-checking `p`, is `some .positive`, and his inner
  reading, double-checking `¬p`, is `some .negative`. Each analysis computes it from its own
  structure; here it is the primary polarity of the clause's negation
  (`ClauseNegation.primaryPolarity`), negative for a negation inside the clause and positive for a
  high one ([holmberg-2016]).
* Readings and forms (`NegationPosition`) are related, not identified: the preposed *-n't* of
  *Isn't this the road to Lund?* has both readings for some speakers of English, so each language
  or variety relates a form to a set of readings.
