# Dependency-grammar coreference (binding)

Binding via **d-command** and locality (@cite{hudson-1990}, @cite{gibson-2025}).
The c-command analogue in dependency grammar is *d-command*: `x` d-commands `y`
iff both are dependents of the same head and `x` bears the subject relation.
Locality is the dependency subgraph rooted at the matrix verb.

As with the other frameworks, the binding principles are *not* restated here:
this file supplies dependency grammar's command relation as a
`Binding.CommandRelation` instance, and the framework-neutral engine
(`Syntax/Binding/Basic.lean`) derives Principles A/B/C over it. The file is
language-neutral — it imports no Fragment.

## Main definitions

- `toDepTree`, `dCommands`, `subjectDCommandsObject`, `sameLocalDomain` — the
  d-command relation and its locality restriction, over a `Binding.SimpleClause`.
- `instance : CommandRelation` — the dependency-grammar instance of the abstract
  command relation (d-command); the engine supplies Principles A/B/C over it.

    | none => [clause.subject, clause.verb]

    of the same head and `i` bears the subject relation (nsubj). -/
