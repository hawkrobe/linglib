# RSRL interpretations

This file defines the interpretations of an RSRL signature. An interpretation over a universe
`U` of entities assigns a sort to every entity, a partial function on entities to every
attribute, and a set of tuples of entities to every relation symbol. A term then denotes a
partial function on entities, and the components of an entity are the entities that some path
reaches from it.

## Main definitions

* `HPSG.RSRL.Interpretation`: an interpretation of a signature over a universe `U`.
* `HPSG.RSRL.Interpretation.termDenot`: the term interpretation function under a variable
  assignment.
* `HPSG.RSRL.Interpretation.IsComponentOf`: the component relation between entities.
* `HPSG.RSRL.Interpretation.IsSortResolved`: every entity has a species as its sort.
* `HPSG.RSRL.Interpretation.IsWellTyped`: every defined attribute is appropriate and has a value
  of the appropriate sort.
* `HPSG.RSRL.Interpretation.IsTotallyWellTyped`: in addition, every appropriate attribute is
  defined.

## Main results

* `HPSG.RSRL.Interpretation.isComponentOf_iff_exists_path`: the components of an entity are the
  denotations of the paths that are defined on it.
* `HPSG.RSRL.Interpretation.termDenot_congr`: a term denotation depends only on the values that
  the assignment gives to the variables of the term.
* `HPSG.RSRL.Interpretation.IsWellTyped.admits`: in a well-typed interpretation the signature
  admits every defined path.

## Implementation notes

The universe is a parameter of `Interpretation` rather than a field, as the carrier of a
first-order structure is in mathlib, so that `Fintype` and `DecidableEq` instances on the
universe are found without any per-model declaration.

Richter builds sort resolution and total well-typedness into the definition of an
interpretation. Here they are separate predicates, named as in Carpenter's typed feature logic,
because a worked example usually interprets only the part of a feature structure that the
principle under test mentions. Such an example is well-typed without being totally well-typed.
Richter also restricts the tuples of a relation to entities that are components of one common
entity. That restriction is not imposed.
