# Deep and surface anaphora

[hankamer-sag-1976] divide anaphoric processes into two kinds. A surface anaphor is derived by
deletion under identity with a linguistic antecedent, so its site keeps the syntactic structure of
the elided phrase: VP-ellipsis, sluicing, NP-ellipsis and argument ellipsis are surface anaphora. A
deep anaphor is a pro-form with no internal structure, interpreted as a pronoun is: null complement
anaphora, *pro*, empty nouns and *do it* are deep. This file defines the classification and its
defining property. It classifies anaphoric processes, not nominals, and is independent of the
binding classes of `Binding.BindingClass`.

## Main definitions

* `Anaphor.Depth`: the depth of an anaphoric process, deep or surface.
* `Anaphor.Depth.HasInternalStructure`: the site of the anaphor contains syntactic structure,
  which holds of surface anaphora and of no others.

## Implementation notes

The classification is defined by internal structure alone. The other properties Hankamer and Sag
associated with depth, such as pragmatic control and the missing-antecedent phenomenon, are tests
for that structure, and a test is stated with the data of the study that applies it.
[merchant-2013-diagnosing] keeps extraction, agreement and inverse scope as diagnostics of
ellipsis and sets pragmatic control aside, since an ellipsis can be pragmatically controlled under
limited conditions; [landau-2026] adds a test that decides depth where extraction and agreement
cannot, and `Studies/Landau2026.lean` shows when a test decides depth.
