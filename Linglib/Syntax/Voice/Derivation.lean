# Voice derivations

A derivation applies voices one after another to a clause's participants. A `Stage` records
where each participant sits in the current frame, the referential dependencies established and
the agreements registered so far; applying a voice moves each participant to the slot its own
corresponds to (`Voice.image`), suppresses those without one, lets a fresh participant into the
slot the voice introduces (`Voice.introduced`) and links a subject the voice cumulates
(`Voice.fate`) to each participant cumulated with it. Agreement registers the participants in
the subject slot, the pivot of the frame.

The single-process architecture of [baker-1985] §6 reads a word's morphology and its
grammatical functions off one such sequence, and [hyman-2003] separates the two again for
Bantu, where the syntactic derivation is read off scope while the affix order is templatic.

## Main definitions

* `Voice.Stage` — participants at the slots of a frame, with links and registrations.
* `Voice.Stage.subjects`, `Stage.apply`, `Stage.agree` — the subject participants, the stage a
  voice derives, and agreement registration.

## Main results

* `Voice.Stage.registered_agree_apply`, `registered_apply_agree` — agreement before a voice
  registers the subject before it applied, agreement after it the subject after.
