# Construction-relative composition

Rules of semantic combination are construction-relative: a construction
"specifies how the semantics of the daughters are combined to produce the
semantics of the mother, and what additional semantics, if any, is
contributed by the construction itself" ([kay-michaelis-2019] §4). A
composition rule is partial — it demands daughter denotations of the
right shape — and mismatches are repaired by the override principle
([michaelis-2004], (20)): the lexical item conforms to the meaning of the
structure in which it is embedded.

## Main definitions

* `CompositionRule`: from the daughters' denotations to the mother's
* `CompositionRule.override`: readings under the override principle, one per daughter and
  reconciliation operator
* `interps`: all readings of a tree, through the forms its constituents instantiate

/-- Readings under the override principle ([michaelis-2004], (20)): "if a lexical item is
semantically incompatible with its morphosyntactic context, the meaning of the lexical item
conforms to the meaning of the structure in which it is embedded". The rule's own output where
the daughters already conform, and otherwise one reading for each daughter and reconciliation
operator that makes the daughters conform when applied to that daughter alone. Distinct repairs
produce genuine ambiguity. -/
