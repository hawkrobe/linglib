# Constructions

A construction is a learned pairing of a form and a meaning, for Goldberg the basic unit of
grammatical knowledge. The form side is a `TypedForm`, a sequence of `Slot`s, each fixing a
lexeme, opening a category, or admitting any phrase, and a construction's `Specificity` is derived
from its slot structure rather than stipulated.

## Main definitions

* `SlotFiller`, `Slot`, `TypedForm`: the typed form side
* `derivedSpecificity`, `HasConstraint`, `refGroupCount`: measures derived
  from forms
* `Construction`, `Construction.specificity`, `Construction.map`: typed
  form–meaning pairings
* `Construction.IsFullyCompositional`, `Construction.IsFormalIdiom`: analyzability by the
  universal combination schemata, and lexical openness

/-! ### Typed slots

Slot content follows [dunn-2025]'s three representation levels, a fixed lexeme (LEX), a word of
a category (SYN) and a semantic constraint (SEM), with the categories the parts of speech of
Universal Dependencies where Dunn's are learned, plus [kay-fillmore-1999]'s headed phrases,
grammatical functions, coreference indices and slot constraints. -/

/-- A slot's filler gives the slot's content at one of the representation levels. It is
parameterized over the lexeme type `Lex`, so the same representation works for strings,
morphemes, or phonological forms. -/
inductive SlotFiller (Lex : Type*) where
  /-- `fixed w` is the word form `w` itself, at the LEX level, as `fixed "must"`. -/
  | fixed : Lex → SlotFiller Lex
  /-- `open_ pos` is any word of part of speech `pos`, as `open_ .VERB`. -/
  | open_ : UD.UPOS → SlotFiller Lex
  /-- `headed w pos` is a phrase of part of speech `pos` headed by the lexeme `w`
      ([kay-fillmore-1999]), so `headed "doing" .VERB` is a VP headed by *doing*. It is at the
      LEX level, since the head lexeme is fixed even though the phrase is open. -/
  | headed : Lex → UD.UPOS → SlotFiller Lex
  /-- `semantic c` is any expression meeting the semantic constraint `c`, at the SEM level
      ([dunn-2025]), so `semantic "animate"` is any expression denoting an animate. -/
  | semantic : String → SlotFiller Lex
  /-- `phrasal` is any phrase, with no fixed head and no category restriction on its internal
      structure, the filler of a phrasal-compound or PAL slot (the ⟨phrase⟩ node of
      [goldberg-shirtz-2025]'s Figure 5). -/
  | phrasal : SlotFiller Lex
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- A filler is open when no lexeme anchors it. The `open_`, `semantic` and `phrasal` fillers
are open, while `fixed` and `headed` are not, the latter fixing its head lexeme even though the
phrase is open. -/

  | .open_ _ | .semantic _ | .phrasal => isTrue trivial

/-- The grammatical function of a valence member ([kay-fillmore-1999], Figure 12) is distinct
from its semantic role, since a subject can be an agent, a theme, or an experiencer. -/
inductive GrammaticalFunction where
  /-- Subject. -/
  | subj
  /-- Clausal or verbal complement. -/
  | comp
  /-- Direct object. -/
  | obj
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- A reference index marks unification across slots, [kay-fillmore-1999]'s #1 and #2; values
bearing one index are unified. -/
abbrev RefIndex := Nat

/-- A slot constraint is a syntactic constraint on a slot ([kay-fillmore-1999], Figure 12). -/
inductive SlotConstraint where
  /-- `[loc -]` requires the slot to occur left-isolated, not VP-internal. -/
  | locMinus
  /-- `[neg -]` forbids negating the slot. -/
  | negMinus
  /-- `[ref ∅]` marks the slot as no operator, "in the sense of binding the reference of something
      else". -/

  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- A slot in a construction's form has a filler, a headedness flag, and Kay and Fillmore's
lexicality of the position, where `lex := none` leaves it unspecified; their maximality is not
stored, since a head is nonmaximal and every other daughter maximal. A slot's semantics bears
its `refIdx`, and a predicate phrase that does not realize its own subject bears the index of that
subject requirement as its `subjIdx`. Coinstantiation, which covers raising and control, unifies a
predicator's subject with the subject requirement of its complement ([kay-fillmore-1999],
Figure 13). -/

  /-- `filler` is what fills the slot. -/

word,
the defining configuration of phrasal compounds and the PAL construction ([goldberg-shirtz-2025])

/-! ### Constructions and the network -/

/-- A construction is a learned pairing of form and meaning. The meaning pole is typed by the
domain that owns the construction, such as a composition rule or a presupposition, with `Unit`
for a purely formal record or a defective, form-only construction. -/
structure Construction (Sem : Type*) where
  /-- `form` is the form pole. -/
  form : TypedForm String
  /-- `meaning` is the meaning pole. -/

  /-- `pragmaticPoint` records whether the construction carries a conventional pragmatic point
      ([fillmore-kay-oconnor-1988] §1.1.4). -/

/-- A construction is fully compositional when the universal combination schemata alone analyze
it, when its form is fully abstract and it carries no pragmatic point. This is a proxy for
[mueller-2013]'s structural criterion, approximating what [kay-michaelis-2019] survey as a
continuum. -/

/-- A construction is a formal idiom in the sense of [fillmore-kay-oconnor-1988] §1.1.3, a
lexically open idiom, when it is a syntactic pattern rather than a lexically filled expression.
The distinction is a cline (fn. 3), which `Specificity` discretizes. -/
