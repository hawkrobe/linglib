# Control: Basic Lemmas

Basic lemmas about the control vocabulary of `Syntax/Control/Defs.lean`: the
exhaustive-control lemma family (refinement, composition, exclusion of
partial readings and split antecedents), the localization of a partial
reading to a leg of a composite dependency, the phenomenology of saturation,
and the occupant-mismatch refutation engine of the overt-copy diagnostics
([polinsky-potsdam-2006]).

/-! ### Exhaustive control -/

variable {Pos Ref : Type*} {val : Pos → Ref} {ante bind pred d : SetRel Pos Pos}
  {a b p q c : Pos}

/-- Related positions of an exhaustive dependency are co-valued. -/
theorem IsExhaustive.eq (hs : IsExhaustive val ante) (h : a ~[ante] b) :
    val a = val b :=
  hs h

/-- A refinement of an exhaustive dependency is exhaustive. -/
theorem IsExhaustive.mono (h : ante ⊆ bind) (hs : IsExhaustive val bind) :
    IsExhaustive val ante :=
  h.trans hs

/-- Exhaustivity composes through the mediating position. -/
theorem IsExhaustive.comp (hb : IsExhaustive val bind)
    (hp : IsExhaustive val pred) : IsExhaustive val (bind ○ pred) := by
  rintro ⟨a, c⟩ ⟨m, ham, hmc⟩
  exact (hb.eq ham).trans (hp.eq hmc)

/-- Exhaustive control excludes partial readings: no strict growth of the
    referent along the dependency ([landau-2000]). -/
theorem IsExhaustive.not_lt [Preorder Ref] (hs : IsExhaustive val ante)
    (h : a ~[ante] b) : ¬ val a < val b := by
  simp [hs.eq h]

/-- Under exhaustive control, joint antecedents are co-valued — split control
    needs a non-exhaustive leg. -/
theorem IsExhaustive.eq_of_two (hs : IsExhaustive val ante)
    (ha : a ~[ante] p) (hb : b ~[ante] p) : val a = val b :=
  (hs.eq ha).trans (hs.eq hb).symm

/-- An exhaustive dependency admits no partial reading. -/
theorem IsExhaustive.not_isPartial [Preorder Ref]
    (h : IsExhaustive val d) : ¬ IsPartial val d :=
  fun ⟨_, _, hab, hlt⟩ => absurd (h.eq hab) hlt.ne

/-- A partial reading in a composite localizes to a leg: if referents grow
    monotonely along the first leg and strictly across the composite, one of
    the two legs already grows strictly. -/
theorem exists_lt_of_comp_lt [PartialOrder Ref]
    (hb : ∀ ⦃x m⦄, x ~[bind] m → val x ≤ val m)
    (h : a ~[bind ○ pred] c) (hlt : val a < val c) :
    (∃ x m, x ~[bind] m ∧ val x < val m) ∨
      ∃ m x, m ~[pred] x ∧ val m < val x := by

  rcases (hb ham).lt_or_eq with hlt' | heq
  · exact Or.inl ⟨a, m, ham, hlt'⟩
  · exact Or.inr ⟨m, c, hmc, heq ▸ hlt⟩

/-! ### Saturation -/

/-- A saturating dependency admits no partial reading. -/
theorem IsSaturating.not_isPartial [Preorder Ref] (h : IsSaturating val d) :
    ¬ IsPartial val d :=
  h.exhaustive.not_isPartial

/-- A saturating dependency admits no split: joint controllers coincide. -/
theorem IsSaturating.eq_of_controllers (h : IsSaturating val d)
    (ha : a ~[d] p) (hb : b ~[d] p) : a = b :=
  h.biUnique.1 ha hb

/-- A saturating dependency admits no split antecedents. -/
theorem IsSaturating.not_isSplit (h : IsSaturating val d) : ¬ IsSplit d :=
  not_not_intro h.biUnique.1

/-- A saturating controller saturates a single slot: its dependents
    coincide. -/
theorem IsSaturating.eq_of_controlled (h : IsSaturating val d)
    (hp : a ~[d] p) (hq : a ~[d] q) : p = q :=
  h.biUnique.2 hp hq

/-! ### Enforcement

Which assignment a dependency exhaustively shares distinguishes the
enforcement species ([bresnan-1982]): functional control shares the occupant
assignment itself (structure sharing — movement chains, LFG control
equations), anaphoric control only the referent valuation. Occupant sharing
is the stronger: a shared assignment transports along every map of it
(`IsExhaustive.map`), so every occupant property transports across the
dependency (`IsExhaustive.iff_of_rel`) — and one observed mismatch refutes
it (`not_isExhaustive_of_mismatch`), the engine of the overt-copy
diagnostics ([polinsky-potsdam-2006]). -/

variable {Item : Type*} {occ : Pos → Item}

/-- Sharing an assignment transports along any map of it: token identity
    yields referential co-valuation for every referent map. -/
theorem IsExhaustive.map (hs : IsExhaustive occ ante) (f : Item → Ref) :
    IsExhaustive (f ∘ occ) ante := by
  rintro ⟨a, b⟩ h
  exact congrArg f (hs.eq h)

/-- Under a shared assignment, every property of the assigned value transports
    across the dependency: copies are indistinguishable. -/
theorem IsExhaustive.iff_of_rel (hs : IsExhaustive occ ante)
    (h : a ~[ante] b) (P : Item → Prop) : P (occ a) ↔ P (occ b) :=
  iff_of_eq (congrArg P (hs.eq h))

/-- One observed mismatch refutes a shared assignment — the refutation engine
    of the copy-control diagnostics. -/
theorem not_isExhaustive_of_mismatch {P : Item → Prop} (h : a ~[ante] b)
    (hPa : P (occ a)) (hPb : ¬ P (occ b)) : ¬ IsExhaustive occ ante :=
  fun hs => hPb (hs.eq h ▸ hPa)
