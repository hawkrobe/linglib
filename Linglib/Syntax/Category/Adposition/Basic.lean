# Adpositions

An adposition is a grammatical word that forms a phrase with a term it governs and marks, as a
case affix does, the relation of that term to the head of the phrase (Hagège's definition,
p. 8). Haspelmath groups case markers and adpositions together as *flags*, since they do the same
work and cannot be told apart consistently across languages. So an entry here records the
relations it marks as comparative case values, a set because adpositions are polysemous, beside
its exponent as morphs, the positions it takes relative to its term, and the complements it
takes. An adposition may occur without its term when the term is understood (Hagège p. 54,
*she stayed in*), and a particle such as Dutch *heen* occurs only without one.

## Main definitions

* `Adposition`: the entry.
* `Adposition.Linearization`, `Adposition.Complement`: positions and complement kinds.
* `Adposition.IsPreposition`, `IsPostposition`, `IsCircumposition`, `IsAmbiposition`: the
  position classes.
* `Adposition.Takes`, `IsIntransitive`, `IsTransitive`, `IsParticle`: valence.
* `Adposition.IsComplex`, `IsBound`, `form`, `toWord`: the exponent.
* `Adposition.kinds`, `kind?`, `IsSpatial`: the types of case among the values marked.

## Main results

* `Adposition.isParticle_iff`: a particle takes no complement.
* `Adposition.isSpatial_iff`: a spatial adposition marks a value with a path direction or the
  terminative.
* `Adposition.kind?_eq_some_iff`: the type of an adposition is the type all its values share.

## Implementation notes

* The positions follow Dryer's WALS chapter 85 with circumpositions added. They are a set,
  since an ambiposition such as Dutch *op* is one lexeme preposed or postposed (Hagège
  pp. 114–116). A circumposition lists its pieces in surface order, the first before the term.
* The transitive and intransitive uses of one preposition are one entry, as in Huddleston and
  Pullum (p. 635).
* `functions` is `∅` where no comparative value fits, as for *despite*.
* The case an adposition governs on its complement (Corbett) is a fact about a language's own
  case values and is left to the fragments.
