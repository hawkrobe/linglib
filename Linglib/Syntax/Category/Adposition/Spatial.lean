# Spatial adpositions

A theory refines a spatial `Adposition` by decomposing its relation into an axial part, a
localization and the shape of its path, as Svenonius does in the cartographic sequence. The
shape is one of Pantcheva's eight, `Spatial.Path.Shape`, or none for a locative reading, and the
localization is `Spatial.Localization`, the vocabulary spatial cases decompose into as well. The
axial parts are what case morphology lacks, a flat paradigm rather than a ranked containment.

## Main declarations

* `Adposition.AxPart`: the axial parts (front, back, top, …).
* `Adposition.SpatialReading`: the cartographic decomposition.
* `Adposition.SpatialReading.direction`, `IsBounded`: the direction and boundedness of a
  reading, read off its shape.
