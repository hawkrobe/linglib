# Tense and tense forms

This file defines the grammatical tenses and the tense forms of a verb. A tense is past, present
or future (`Tense`); the cell of times it denotes is the matter of `Semantics/Tense/Defs.lean`. A
tense form of a verb, in the sense of the traditional grammars, is a member of the verb's tense
paradigm, such as the simple past or the present perfect. It is described here by its make-up, the
tense inflection of its finite verb and the nonfinite forms stacked under that verb. A synthetic
form has a finite lexical verb and nothing else. A periphrastic form is built from another form by
putting its verb, in a nonfinite form, under an auxiliary that takes over the tense inflection, so
that the perfect of the simple present *builds* is the present perfect *has built*, and the
perfect of that is the double perfect *has had built* of the South German dialects. Two languages
whose forms have the same make-up share the form, and which tense and which aspect it expresses in
each is a matter of analysis left to studies.

## Main declarations

* `Tense`: the grammatical tenses.
* `Tense.Form.Nonfinite`: the nonfinite verb forms that build periphrastic tense forms.
* `Tense.Form`: a tense form, by the inflection of its finite verb and its nonfinite chain.
* `Tense.Form.under`, `Tense.Form.perfect`, `Tense.Form.progressive`: the periphrastic form
  built on a form.
* `Tense.Form.simplePresent`, `Tense.Form.simplePast` and the forms built on them, among them
  `Tense.Form.presentPerfect`, `Tense.Form.doublePerfect` and `Tense.Form.future`.
* `Tense.Form.IsPerfect`: the form is the perfect of some form.
* `Tense.Periphrasis`, `Tense.Periphrasis.realize`: a language's means of building tense forms
  over its verbs, and the words of a form of a verb.

gives the finite form of a verb in each tense, its nonfinite forms, and the auxiliary under
which a verb stands when it is in a given nonfinite form. Each is partial, since a language may lack an inflection, as German
lacks a future inflection, or a construction, as German lacks a progressive. -/
