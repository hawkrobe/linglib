# Clause-embedding adjectives

Adjectives that take clausal complements: *annoyed (that p)*, *sorry (that p)*, *aware (that p)*,
*able (to VP)*. As `GradableAdjective` in `Semantics/Degree/Adjective.lean` extends the
`Adjective` core with its degree semantics, `ClauseEmbeddingAdjective` extends it with the
clausal-selection facets of a verb entry: the frames of its complement, its presupposition,
implicative and attitude profiles, and its control readings.

Whether an adjectival predicate takes a copula is a property of the language, not of the
adjective ([stassen-2013b]): English realizes these predicates as *be* and the adjective,
`ClauseEmbeddingAdjective.toVerb` with the copula *be*, while Mandarin encodes predicative
adjectives as verbs.
