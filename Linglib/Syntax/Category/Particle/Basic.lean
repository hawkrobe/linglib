# Particle

This file defines `Particle`, the lexical core of an uninflectable function word in Zwicky's
sense: its form, its position relative to its host, and its distribution over the cells of
`Clause.Distribution`, a sentence type in an embedding context. The distribution records where
the source finds the particle obligatory, optional or excluded, and nothing where the source is
silent; it records distributional felicity, not the licensing mechanism, which is a study's
matter. A particle is licensed in a cell where it is possible, and its sentence-type and
embedding-context profiles are the domain and codomain of that relation, derived and never
stored.

## Main definitions

* `Particle`, `Particle.Position`: the entry and its position class.
* `Particle.Licensed`, `Particle.LicensedIn`, `Particle.LicensedInEmbed`: licensing in a cell
  and its two marginals.
* `Particle.IsSentential`: some cell is recorded.
* `Particle.toWord`: the projection to `Word`.
