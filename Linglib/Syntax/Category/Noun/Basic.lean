# Noun

The noun as a lexical entry: its citation form and its gloss, everything a noun of any
language carries. A proper name extends the entry with the natural gender its pronouns agree
with, where it has one, and projects as a third-person `PROPN` token; it is its own type rather
than a flag on the noun, since a name has no countability or plural and the syntax projects it
as a different head. A language with gender extends the entry with the controller gender in
its own carrier, the gender the language's assignment rules give the noun, and with the
gender of its referents where they have one, the one facet every system with a semantic core
reads; the facets particular rules read besides, animacy, rationality, declension class or
accent, are the fields of the fragments' further extensions. A noun's gender is natural when
it is the gender of its referents. A classified noun records the ways a numeral counts it:
without a classifier, as in *three cups*, or with one, as in Mandarin *sān běn shū* 'three CL
book'. A noun that no numeral counts in either way, such as *milk*, is counted only through a
measure word, as in *three cups of milk*, and a count noun is one some numeral counts.

## Main definitions

* `Noun`: the noun entry.
* `ProperName`: the entry of a name, with its natural gender and its `Word` token.
* `GenderedNoun G`: the entry with its controller gender over the carrier `G` and the gender of
  its referents.
* `GenderedNoun.IsNaturalGender`: the gender is the referents', under a labelling of the carrier.
* `ClassifiedNoun C`: the entry with the ways a numeral counts it, over the carrier `C` of
  classifiers.
* `ClassifiedNoun.IsCount`, `ClassifiedNoun.IsBareCount`, `ClassifiedNoun.classifiers`: some
  numeral counts the noun, a numeral counts it without a classifier, and the classifiers it is
  counted with.

## Implementation notes

The general concept takes the plain name and the specializations extend it, as in mathlib. A
fragment's extension is its own `Noun`, in its namespace; a file that opens that namespace
qualifies the name, the root `Noun` being in scope too. A noun that is count in one use and
mass in another, *many seeds* and *much seed*, has an entry for each class.

`IsCount` is a diagnostic of the numeral construction. It sorts Mandarin nouns by whether they
take a count-classifier, with Cheng and Sybesma, where Chierchia makes every Mandarin noun mass,
and in a language whose numerals combine with every noun it makes every noun count. A language
without classifiers takes `C := Empty`, so a numeral counts its nouns without one or not at
all.
