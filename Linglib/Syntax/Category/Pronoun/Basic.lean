# Pronouns

This file defines the pronoun as a lexical object: a surface form with the agreement features
every pronoun kind shares. The kinds extend it, each in its own file: `PersonalPronoun`,
`LogophoricPronoun`, `ReflexivePronoun`, `ReciprocalPronoun`, `DemonstrativePronoun`,
`InterrogativePronoun` and `IndefinitePronoun`. A `Pronoun` has no denotation, pronoun type or
binding class of its own; the kind supplies them, and `Pronoun.toWord` takes the last two as
arguments.

## Main definitions

* `Pronoun.Strength` — the clitic, weak and strong classes of [cardinaletti-starke-1999], a
  bounded linear order by structural deficiency
* `Pronoun` — the form, person, number, case and gender of a pronoun, with its script form
  and the strength class of its series
* `Pronoun.categories` — the referential categories of [cysouw-2003] that the person and
  number realize
* `Pronoun.WellFormed` — clusivity is not borne by a singular
* `Pronoun.toWord` — the pronoun as a token, with the pronoun type and reflexive marking of
  its kind
* `Pronoun.CandidateAntecedent` — a nominal token that agrees with the pronoun

## Main results

* `Pronoun.bindingClassOf_toWord_reflex`, `Pronoun.bindingClassOf_toWord_rcp`,
  `Pronoun.bindingClassOf_toWord` — the binding class the engine reads off a pronoun's token is
  fixed by the marking its kind supplies

/-- The three pronoun classes of [cardinaletti-starke-1999], ordered by structural deficiency
with the most deficient least. The classes are distributional: stress does not define them. -/
inductive Pronoun.Strength where
  /-- A deficient head: adjacent to the verb, clustering and prosodically dependent, as
  Italian *lo* and French *le*. -/
  | clitic
  /-- A deficient phrase: confined to derived positions and not coordinable, yet a prosodic
  word, as German *es* and Italian dative *loro*. -/
  | weak
  /-- A non-deficient phrase: coordinable, modifiable and free to stand in peripheral
  positions, as Italian and French *lui*. -/
