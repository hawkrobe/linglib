# Determiners

This file defines the determiner as a lexical object and the determiner inventory of a
language. The base `Determiner` carries only a surface form, and the four specializations
`Article`, `DemonstrativeDeterminer`, `Quantifier` and `PossessiveDeterminer` extend
it. An inventory is
a list of `Determiner.Entry` occurrences, and the typologies of definiteness marking are
derived from it rather than declared. An entry marks an article strength when one of the
definite uses it obligatorily expones calls for that strength, and a language's [moroney-2021]
cell and [schwarz-2009] article system are theorems about its inventory, discharged by
`decide`.

## Main declarations

* `Determiner` is the base record, and `Determiner.toWord` realizes it as a word.
* `Article` records definiteness, the exponent and the definite uses the article obligatorily
  expones; `DemonstrativeDeterminer`, `Quantifier` and `PossessiveDeterminer` are the
  other specializations.
* `Determiner.Entry` is an occurrence of one of the four kinds in an inventory, `Entry.kind`
  is its kind together with an article's definiteness, and `Entry.Marks` says which strengths
  it marks.
* `Determiner.Inventory` is a language's declared inventory. `Inventory.Marks` and
  `Inventory.IsSyncretic` lift the entry predicates, and `Inventory.markingStrategy` and
  `Inventory.articleType` derive the typological cells, each characterized by an `_iff` lemma.
* `Determiner.Inventory.Realizes` says that the inventory carries a form for a kind of nominal
  description.
* `Article.strengths` is the set of strengths an article admits.

## Implementation notes

This file is the Frame-free lexical layer. The denotations of articles, demonstratives and
possessives are in `Semantics/Reference/Determiner.lean`, and the generalized-quantifier
denotation of a `Quantifier` is supplied by its consumers. `Inventory` is a `def`
rather than an `abbrev` so that its operations resolve by dot notation; its membership is the
list's, and facts about one-entry inventories go through `Inventory.marks_singleton`.
`Realizes` is
inventory data and neither licensing nor felicity. A kind can be expressed without a determiner
realizing it, as Shan anaphoric definites are by bare nouns ([moroney-2021]), and which form a
context selects is pragmatics ([jenks-2018]).

/-- An article is the definite or indefinite determiner. Its `uses` are the definite uses it
obligatorily expones, and they are empty for an indefinite. -/

  /-- The definite uses the article obligatorily expones. -/
  uses : Finset DefiniteUse := ∅
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- A demonstrative determiner carries a deictic feature. Its `definiteUses` are the definite
uses it obligatorily expones, as Mandarin *na* expones the anaphoric use, and they are empty for
a demonstrative that merely can be used anaphorically. -/

/-- A quantificational determiner records only what its generalized-quantifier denotation
leaves open, the grammatical number it selects and whether it selects mass nouns, since
synonymous determiners such as *every* and *all* differ there. Everything the denotation fixes,
its force, monotonicity, strength and conservativity, is a theorem about the denotation, which
the consumers supply. -/

demonstrative's `definiteUses`; a quantifier or possessive expones none. -/

operations below resolve by dot notation. -/

/-! ### The marking typology

A language's [moroney-2021] cell is a theorem about its inventory, and each cell is
characterized by its `markingStrategy_eq_*_iff` lemma. If uniqueness and familiarity are both
marked by one form, or uniqueness alone is marked, the cell is `.generallyMarked`; if they are
marked by distinct forms, it is `.bipartite`; if familiarity alone is marked, for instance by a
demonstrative, it is `.markedAnaphoric`; and if neither is marked, it is `.unmarked`. -/

/-! ### Realization -/

/-- An inventory realizes a kind of nominal description when it carries a form for it. A bare
nominal needs no determiner, a unique or anaphoric definite needs an entry marking its
strength, and an indefinite, demonstrative or possessive needs an entry of that kind. -/

English *the* admits both, and a weak or strong article admits one. -/
