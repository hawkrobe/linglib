# Spell-out domains of a derivation

A Spell-out domain in the sense of [fox-pesetsky-2005] is a constituent the derivation has built,
linearized when Spell-out applies to it. On a derivation the constituent built by the first `m`
steps is the ordered object of that stage, and at a later stage `n` it stands inside the larger
object with whatever has moved out of it in between replaced by traces
(`Derivation.spelloutDomain`). Its Spell-out at `n` is its pronounced yield
(`Derivation.spellout`), so the Spell-out snapshots that cyclic linearization reads
(`Linearization/Cyclic.lean`) come from the derivation itself, and a derivation linearizes under a
schedule of Spell-outs when those snapshots cohere (`Derivation.Linearizes`).

Fox and Pesetsky spell a domain out when it is built, which reads the surface of its stage
(`Derivation.spellout_self`); spelling a phase out when the next phase head merges, as Chomsky
proposes, takes the stage after that merge (`Derivation.mergeStage?`). Which constituent a study
spells out, the whole phase or the head with its complement, is the stage it names. A head moved
into a phase head by Internal Merge stays inside the constituent the two build, so the moved verb
of a verb-plus-v head is spelled out with v.

## Main definitions

* `Minimalist.Derivation.spelloutDomain`, `Derivation.spellout`: a domain at a
  later stage, and its Spell-out.
* `Minimalist.Derivation.Linearizes`: a derivation linearizes under a schedule.

## Main statements

* `Minimalist.Derivation.spellout_self`: a domain spelled out when it is built
  reads the surface of its stage.
* `Minimalist.Derivation.spellout_append_of_le`: extending a derivation changes
  no earlier Spell-out.
