# Chains on planar syntactic objects

A planar syntactic object is a copy-theoretic representation. A vertex `Vertex.lex tok` is a
pronounced copy of `tok` and a vertex `Vertex.traceOf tok` a deleted one, the trace Internal Merge
leaves, Marcolli, Chomsky and Berwick's cancellation `T/T_v` with the head of `T_v` remembered.
The chain of a token is the list of its copies, and a copy stands for the maximal projection of
its token, so a moved phrase sits where its head projects. A token moves when it has a deleted
copy. A token bound in situ by an operator, as for Pesetsky, has a single copy. A deleted copy
above the pronounced one is Huang's covert movement, and a pronounced copy between two deleted
ones is Sato and Ngui's partial movement, so where a phrase is pronounced and where it takes scope
come apart without a separate choice of the copy to spell out. A token with two pronounced copies
is shared, dominated by two mothers, Citko's Parallel Merge.

A copy is linked to the nearest copy above it, the one whose projection c-commands it with no
other copy's projection in between, c-command being Barker and Pullum's `PhraseStructure.CCommands`.
Locality constrains links. Chomsky's Phase Impenetrability Condition bars a link from the interior
of a phase, the positions its head c-commands, to a position outside the head's maximal
projection, so that the edge is the escape hatch (`Crosses`); an island is a domain no link may
leave (`Escapes`). A token with one copy has no link, so binding in situ is subject to neither
(`links_eq_nil_of_length_le_one`), and movement, covert movement included, is subject to both, as
Sato and Ngui find.

## Main definitions

* `Minimalist.tokenList`, `Minimalist.traceList`: the pronounced and the deleted copies.
* `occurrences`, `traces`, `chain`, `Moves`, `IsShared`: the copies of a token.
* `headIndex?`, `projectionAt`: the head daughter of a constituent, and the phrase a copy stands
  for, its maximal projection along head daughters (`PhraseStructure.maximalProjectionAt`).
* `HasAntecedent`, `orphanTraces`: whether a pronounced copy c-commands a deleted one, and the
  deleted copies without antecedents, seen from their own conjunct copies.
* `IsLink`, `links`, `chainTop`: the links of a chain and its scope position.
* `interior`, `Crosses`, `Escapes`: phases, islands, and the links that leave them.

## Implementation notes

* Positions, not terms, individuate copies: two deleted copies of one token are the same term,
  so the phase interior of the unordered object (`SyntacticObject.phaseInterior`, the terms
  within the head's complement) cannot tell the links of a successive-cyclic chain apart.
  `interior` is the head's c-command domain on positions.
* The head of a constituent is found down its right spine (`headPos?`), a left leaf that selects
  nothing being a specifier. Where two saturated phrases are sisters, a specifier and its sister,
  the selection head `SyntacticObject.selHead` is undefined, as Marcolli, Chomsky and Berwick's
  head functions are, and the labeling algorithm (`SyntacticObject.label`) labels the object only
  once one of them has moved on; `headPos?` takes the right sister, so that a phrase with a
  specifier has a maximal projection to locate a copy in.
* A chain here is the copies an object contains; the replay of a derivation
  (`Derivation.externalize?`) builds overt chains with bound traces, while covert movement,
  sharing and copies without antecedents are available to the representation only.

## TODO

* `CCommands t.val a b ↔ a.parent ≤ b ∧ ¬ a ≤ b` on a well-formed object, for `b` not the mother
  of `a`: c-command as sisterhood-plus-dominance.
* `q ∈ interior t h ↔ (t : SyntacticObject).WithinComplement ℓ s` for a token `ℓ` at `h` that
  occurs once and projects, and the subtree `s` at `q ≠ ⊥`: the bridge to the unordered phase
  API.
* A successful `Derivation.externalize?` has no deleted copy without an antecedent.
