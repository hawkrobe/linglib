# Probe profiles

This file defines a probe's locality profile, the head that hosts it together with the category
that terminates its search, its horizon. Keine labels a clause bilaterally, by the set of heads
it projects, and a clause is transparent to a probe exactly when its label does not contain the
horizon. Transparency is then antitone in the extension order of clause spines, which is Upward
Entailment, and a probe whose horizon lies in the label of its own sister is vacuous, the premise
of the Height–Locality Theorem. A profile denotes a `Probe` over any goal type that exposes a
label; the tree-native counterpart of a horizon is `SyntacticObject.behindHorizonIn`.

## Main definitions

* `Minimalist.Probe.Profile`: the head hosting a probe and the category that is its horizon.
* `Minimalist.Probe.Profile.TransparentTo`: a bilateral label not containing the horizon.
* `Minimalist.Probe.Profile.IsVacuous`: a horizon lying in the label of the probe's sister on the
  standard verbal spine.
* `Minimalist.Probe.Profile.toProbe`: the probe a profile denotes over goals exposing labels.

## Main results

* `Minimalist.Probe.Profile.transparentTo_label_antitone`: Upward Entailment.
