# Probe: relativized search over a goal sequence
[bejar-rezac-2003] [preminger-2014]

A `Probe α` is the theory-agnostic relativized-*search* kernel over a
goal sequence `List α`. It bundles what the probe *sees* (`vis` — the
search halts at the first visible goal) and what it can *value* there
(`act` — a visible but inactive goal absorbs the probe, [deal-2024]-style
interaction vs. satisfaction). Probe *specifications* — relativized
targets, satisfaction conditions, horizon profiles, articulated/dynamic
probes — denote a `Probe` by a `toProbe`-map rather than re-implementing
search.

This models a probe's *search* (locality, intervention, satisfaction);
feature *transmission* — what a successful Agree copies/shares/values — is
a separate concern (`Agree.applyAgree`). This is the general core: the
φ-specialization is in `Probe/Phi.lean`, the satisfaction spec in
`Probe/Satisfaction.lean`, Keine's horizon spec in `Probe/Profile.lean`.

## Main declarations

- `Probe`, `Probe.ofVis`, `Probe.indiscriminate` — the bundle and constructors.
- `Probe.search` / `Probe.agree` — first visible goal / that goal if active.
- `Probe.outcome`, `Probe.Outcome` — valued vs. unvalued.
- `Probe.Licensed`, `Probe.AllLicensed`, `allLicensed_iff` — one search
  licenses at most one goal (the Person Licensing Condition's engine).
- `Probe.cascade` — ordered probe sequence, first with output wins.

`toProbe` specs denoting a `Probe`: `Probe.Target.toProbe`,
`SatisfactionCond.toProbe`, `Probe.Profile.toProbe`,
`Probe.Articulated.toProbes`, `Deal2024.ProbeState.probe`.

## TODO

- **Transmission axis.** `Probe` models *search*, not what a successful
  Agree copies/shares/values. A `Probe.agreeWith : Probe α → (α → V) →
  List α → Σ` (Σ = `Option V` / `List V` for [hiraiwa-2001] Multiple
  Agree / a shared-occurrence type for Frampton-Gutmann feature-sharing)
  would fold `applyAgree`, Multiple Agree, Agree-Link/Copy
  ([arregi-nevins-2012]), and case-by-Agree into one extension.
- **Upward Agree.** Search is downward (c-command, `search_eq_some_iff_closest`);
  add a direction parameter for Bjorkman & Zeijlstra (2019)-style upward Agree.
- **`Preorder (Probe α)`** by pointwise `vis`-refinement, so
  `outcome_valued_mono` / `Deal2024.probe_vis_antitone` become order facts.
- **`HalpertHammerly2026.agreementClass`**: re-stipulated relativized
  search; should be two `Probe` searches with a `_eq_derived` theorem.
