# Probes as interaction and satisfaction specifications

This file defines a probe over a goal type as two predicates on goals, following Deal's
interaction/satisfaction theory of Agree. A goal *interacts* with the probe when it bears features
the probe copies, and *satisfies* it when it bears features that halt the search. A search over an
ordered goal sequence stops at the first satisfying goal, and the probe Agrees with that goal when
it also interacts; a satisfying goal that does not interact absorbs the probe, Deal's satisfaction
without interaction. The outcome of a search is `valued` iff some goal satisfies the probe, and an
unvalued outcome is failed Agree, tolerated under Preminger's obligatory-operations model. A goal is
licensed when the search reaches it, as for Béjar and Rezac; which goals need licensing and which
satisfy the probe come apart in general, as for Halpert's Zulu L⁰, which every goal satisfies while
only augmentless nominals need it. The full operation, which copies from every interacting goal up
to the satisfier, is `Probe.run` in `Probe/Run.lean`.

Probe *specifications*, such as relativized targets, horizon profiles and articulated probes,
denote a `Probe` by a `toProbe` map rather than re-implementing search.

## Main definitions

* `Minimalist.Probe`: an interaction predicate and a satisfaction predicate on goals.
* `Minimalist.Probe.relativized`, `Minimalist.Probe.ofInt`, `Minimalist.Probe.insatiable`,
  `Minimalist.Probe.indiscriminate`: the probes `[INT:F, SAT:F]`, `[INT:F, SAT:⊤]`,
  `[INT:F, SAT:⊥]` and `[INT:⊤, SAT:⊤]`.
* `Minimalist.Probe.search`, `Minimalist.Probe.agree`: the first satisfying goal, and that goal
  when it interacts.
* `Minimalist.Probe.outcome`: `valued` iff the search finds a goal.
* `Minimalist.Probe.Licensed`, `Minimalist.Probe.AllLicensed`: a goal the search reaches, and
  every needy goal occurrence being reached.
* `Minimalist.Probe.cascade`: the first finding of an ordered sequence of probes.

## Main results

* `Minimalist.Probe.search_eq_some_iff_closest`: locality as list search.
* `Minimalist.Probe.not_rel_of_search_eq_some`: the found goal is minimal for any precedence
  the sequence respects.
* `Minimalist.Probe.AllLicensed.countP_le_one`, `Minimalist.Probe.relativized_allLicensed_iff`:
  one search licenses at most one goal.
* `Minimalist.Probe.indiscriminate_allLicensed_iff`: under bare minimality only the closest goal
  may need licensing.
