# Phases

The phases of [marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025] §1.14, after [chomsky-2013], with the raising head
`SyntacticObject.raisingHead` as head function. A lexical item heads a phase when it projects, and
its complement is the sister it projects over. The phase is what lies within the terms the head
heads; its interior is what lies within the complement; and its edge is the rest of the phase, the
head and what is merged above it, a phrase raised to the edge included. The Phase
Impenetrability Condition seals the interior: under [chomsky-2000]'s condition to everything
outside the phase, under [chomsky-2001]'s only once the next phase head up is merged, to what lies
outside its interior.

## Main definitions

* `SyntacticObject.IsPhaseHead`, `SyntacticObject.IsComplementOf`: a lexical item projects, and
  the sister it projects over.
* `SyntacticObject.WithinProjection`, `SyntacticObject.WithinComplement`: a term lies within the
  projection or the complement of a head.
* `SyntacticObject.phase`, `SyntacticObject.phaseInterior`, `SyntacticObject.phaseEdge`: the
  phase of a head, its interior, and its edge.
* `Impenetrability`, `SyntacticObject.Accessible`: the two conditions, and the goals each leaves
  accessible to a probe.

## Main statements

* `SyntacticObject.isPhaseHead_iff_phaseInterior_ne_zero`: a head projects exactly when its phase
  has a nonempty interior.
* `SyntacticObject.phaseInterior_add_phaseEdge`: the interior and the edge partition the phase.
* `SyntacticObject.phaseInterior_eq_domainIn`: the interior of a head that projects wherever it
  occurs is its c-command domain.
* `SyntacticObject.Accessible.nextPhase_of_phase`: [chomsky-2000]'s condition is the stronger.

## Implementation notes

* Terms are values, not occurrences, so all copies of a head share one phase, and the lower
  copies of a moved phrase are one term; positions tell copies apart in
  `SyntacticObject/Chain.lean`.
* Every head that projects heads a phase, as in the book; the heads a study counts as phase heads
  (C alone, or also v, D, or Voice) are the list `Accessible` takes.
* Under the raising head a phrase raised to the edge of a head lies in its phase; a phrase merged
  there in place lies in it only when the head selects it.

## TODO

* The terms made inaccessible by the interiors of lower phases, and the stricter variant that
  also freezes their heads.
