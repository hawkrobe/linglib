# Coordination resolution over a dual-feature system

This file defines the resolution of features on a coordinate structure in a dual-feature
system ([adamson-anagnostopoulou-2025], after [smith-2015]), whose application in the paper is
to gender. A nominal's bundle has an interpretable feature set, sent to LF, and an
uninterpretable one, sent to PF. Resolution percolates the interpretable sets of the conjuncts
to the coordination and converts them by intersection, so that the coordination bears exactly
the features every conjunct has. Uninterpretable sets are not intersected but realized set by
set, and their realization converges only when every set receives the same exponent; at
Transfer the redundancy rule sends a nominal's interpretable features to PF when it has no
uninterpretable ones. The features a nominal contributes are the closure of a node in a feature
geometry (`Minimalist.Geometry`), and a geometry satisfying mismatch resolution needs no default.

## Main definitions

* `Minimalist.Coordination.Bundle`: the interpretable and the uninterpretable features of a
  nominal, built by `Minimalist.Coordination.Bundle.single` from one feature and its
  interpretability and sent to PF by `Minimalist.Coordination.Bundle.toPF`.
* `Minimalist.Coordination.resolve`: the intersection of two conjuncts' interpretable features.
* `Minimalist.Coordination.realizeAll`: the exponent a family of feature sets all receive.
