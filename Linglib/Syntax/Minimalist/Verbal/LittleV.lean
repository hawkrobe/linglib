# Little v

[cuervo-2003]'s event introducers: the three flavors of little v that verbalize a root and fix
its event type. `vDO` builds activities, `vGO` events of change, movement and happening, `vBE`
states. A sentence's event structure is the list of its verbal heads from the highest down; a
complex structure embeds one vP under another, and the possible combinations of the
dissertation's table (17) and its footnote are the chains of `LittleV.Embeds`: `vDO` embeds any
event, `vGO` only a state, `vBE` nothing.

Causatives and inchoatives are the two complex structures: an event or state embedded under
`vDO`, and a state embedded under `vGO`. There is no CAUSE head: "being causative is the
property of the configuration as a whole", and the two alternants of *cerrar* share the lower
stative event and differ in the dynamic head that embeds it, `[vDO, vBE]` against `[vGO, vBE]`.
Only a `vDO`-headed structure combines with Voice and so licenses an external argument.

## Main definitions

* `LittleV`, `LittleV.Embeds`, `LittleV.IsWellFormed`
* `LittleV.Activity`, `LittleV.Change`, `LittleV.State`, `LittleV.Causative`,
  `LittleV.Inchoative`, `LittleV.LicensesVoice`

## Main results

* `LittleV.Inchoative.eq_of_isWellFormed`: a well-formed inchoative is exactly `[vGO, vBE]`
* `LittleV.Causative.not_inchoative`: causatives do not include inchoatives
* `LittleV.causative_cons`, `LittleV.inchoative_cons`: the alternation over a shared lower event

## Implementation notes

The head-driven rivals, [pylkkanen-2008]'s Cause head and the v_CAUSE that
[alexiadou-anagnostopoulou-schaefer-2006] and [wood-2015] keep in both alternants so that Voice
alone distinguishes them, are not encodable here: every `Causative` is `BiEventive`, and the
alternation changes the higher head rather than Voice (`Causative.not_inchoative`). A study of
those programs states its claims about `Minimalist.Voice` directly.

/-! ### The causative alternation ([cuervo-2003] §§1.3.4–1.3.5)

Over a shared lower event, `vDO` gives the causative and `vGO` the inchoative: *Vicki cerró la
puerta* is `[vDO, vBE]` under Voice, *se cerró la puerta* is `[vGO, vBE]` with *se* spelling
out `vGO`. -/

theorem causative_cons (h : lower ≠ []) : Causative (.vDO :: lower) :=
  ⟨rfl, Nat.succ_le_succ (List.length_pos_iff.2 h)⟩

theorem inchoative_cons (h : lower ≠ []) : Inchoative (.vGO :: lower) :=
  ⟨rfl, Nat.succ_le_succ (List.length_pos_iff.2 h)⟩

/-- The four possible combinations of table (17) are well formed, the three under `vDO`
    causative and the one under `vGO` inchoative. -/

    Causative [.vDO, .vDO] ∧ Causative [.vDO, .vGO] ∧ Causative [.vDO, .vBE] ∧
      Inchoative [.vGO, .vBE] := by

/-- The combinations the footnote to (17) excludes: nothing under `vBE`, nothing dynamic under
    `vGO`. -/

    ¬ IsWellFormed [.vBE, .vDO] ∧ ¬ IsWellFormed [.vBE, .vGO] ∧
