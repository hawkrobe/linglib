# Applicative heads

Applicative heads introduce applied arguments such as benefactives, goals, sources and affected
datives. [pylkkanen-2008] distinguishes a high applicative, which Merges with the event and
relates the applied argument to it, from a low applicative, which Merges with the theme and
relates the applied argument to it by transfer to or from it; [cuervo-2003] adds the static
possession a low applicative can express and a third type, the affected applicative, which
Merges between two events, taking the result state as its complement under the dynamic head
that embeds it. The type is where the head Merges: `ApplSite`, a cut of the little-v chain of
`Minimalist.LittleV`, is low when no head is below it, so that its complement is the theme DP,
high when no head is above it, so that Voice selects it, and affected between. `ApplSite.applType`
reads the type off the site, and the complement category of the type agrees with that of the site
(`ApplSite.applType_complement`), so the typology follows from attachment height by construction.

## Main definitions

* `LowRelation`, `ApplType`, `ApplType.complement`, `ApplType.IsLow`: the types and the category
  each Merges with.
* `ApplSite`, `ApplSite.Low`, `ApplSite.Affected`, `ApplSite.High`, `ApplSite.complement`,
  `ApplSite.selector`, `ApplSite.applType`, `ApplSite.all`: the merge site and its type.
* `ApplHead`, `ApplHead.Licensed`, `ApplHead.SpecCanBearCase`: the head, its licensing by Voice
  and the case-based blocking of its specifier.

## Main results

* `ApplSite.low_or_affected_or_high`, `ApplSite.applType_complement`, `ApplSite.mem_all_iff`.
* `ApplSite.Affected.biEventive`, `ApplSite.Affected.selector_dynamic`,
  `ApplSite.not_affected_of_state`: an affected applicative needs two events and a dynamic head
  above it, so none is applied under a state.
* `low_licensed_with_any`, `affected_licensed_with_any`, `high_licensed_of_assignsTheta`.

## Implementation notes

`ApplHead.Licensed` states the licensing of a high applicative by a Voice with event semantics
([pylkkanen-2008], [schaefer-2008]), which blocks the ethical dative in middles; [cuervo-2003]'s
high applicative over a state has no Voice above it at all, a disagreement a predicate over Voice
heads cannot state, and `Studies/Cuervo2003` states her licensing over sites instead.
