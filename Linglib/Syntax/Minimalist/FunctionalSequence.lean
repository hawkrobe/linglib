# The functional sequence

This file defines the height of a category in the functional sequence and the families of
extended projections. Grimshaw takes a clause or a noun phrase to be one extended projection, a
lexical head together with the functional heads above it, all of one category family and with a
functional level, the F-value, that does not decrease going up. The F-value of each category is
a natural number, with the lexical heads at `0`, and the four families, verbal, nominal,
adjectival and adpositional, carry Chomsky's `[±V, ±N]` features, so that two categories share
those features exactly when they are of one family. A category extends to another when the two
are of one family and the second is at least as high; the extended projections are the chains
of this relation.

## Main definitions

* `Minimalist.Cat.fValue`: the functional level of a category.
* `Minimalist.CatFamily`, `Minimalist.Cat.family`: the four families of extended projections.
* `Minimalist.CatFeatures`, `Minimalist.Cat.features`: Chomsky's `[±V, ±N]` features, read off
  the family.
* `Minimalist.Cat.ExtendsTo`: the step relation of an extended projection, a preorder.

## Main results

* `Minimalist.Cat.features_eq_iff`: two categories share their features iff they share their
  family.

## Implementation notes

The F-values place the families on one scale, `n` with `v`, `Q` with `T`, `Num` with `Fin` and
`D` with `Foc`. Rizzi's order Fin < Foc < Top < Force fixes the verbal left periphery, Borer's
individuation before counting puts `Q` below `Num`, the Say layer of embedded speech reports
sits between Foc and C as in Egressy, and Speas and Tenny's speech-act head closes the verbal
sequence. Prepositions form their own family, with den Dikken's Place and Path above them,
following Chomsky's `[−V, −N]`, whereas Grimshaw places P in the nominal extended projection.
