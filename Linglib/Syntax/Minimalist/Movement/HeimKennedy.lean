# Degree movement

A degree quantifier, `-er` with its differential, is a quantificational argument of the gradable
predicate and takes scope by Quantifier Raising ([heim-2001]). The Heim–Kennedy constraint filters
the LFs this produces: if the scope of a quantificational DP contains the trace of a DegP, it also
contains that DegP ([heim-2001], [bhatt-pancheva-2004]), so no quantifier intervenes between a
degree abstraction and the variable it binds, the configuration `*λd … QP … d`. Scope is the
c-command domain, so on a scope relation `C` the constraint relates three positions, the quantifier
`q`, the DegP `δ` and its trace `t`: `IsHeimKennedy C q δ t`. [kennedy-1999] reads the absence of
the excluded readings as the absence of degree movement; [heim-2001] keeps the movement and the
filter, [bhatt-pancheva-2004] merges the degree clause at the DegP's scope position so that its
surface site marks the scope the filter constrains, and the than-phrase-internal scope
generalization of [bhatt-takahashi-2011] is the constraint evaluated at the quantifier's base
position.
