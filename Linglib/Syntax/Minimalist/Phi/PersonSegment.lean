# Person segments

The person features that Agree manipulates are the person nodes of Harley and Ritter's feature
geometry: the root `π`, which every nominal bears, [participant], and its dependents [speaker]
and [addressee]. Béjar and Rezac call them the segments of an articulated person probe. The
segments a person bears are read off the geometry, a bare [participant] receiving [speaker] by
default.

## Main definitions

* `Minimalist.PersonSegment`: the person segments, ordered by the dominance of the geometry.
* `Minimalist.PersonSegment.toNode`: a segment as a node of the geometry.
* `Minimalist.PersonSegment.spec`: the segments a person bears.

## Main results

* `Minimalist.PersonSegment.spec_isLowerSet`: a person bears whatever its segments depend on.

## Implementation notes

`π` is Harley and Ritter's root Referring Expression node, which Deal writes `[φ]`.
