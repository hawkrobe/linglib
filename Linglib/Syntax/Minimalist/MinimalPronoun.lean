# Minimal pronouns

A minimal pronoun is a bare D head with unvalued φ-features, `[D, uφ]`, valued by its
antecedent. Kratzer takes reflexives, controlled PRO and bound-variable pronouns to be one such
object, and Safir concludes that all anaphoric diversity is morphological: a language's
vocabulary items realize the valued pronoun according to the context it is bound in, and where
no item is conditioned on that context the elsewhere item applies, yielding the shape of the
referential pronoun. English has a null item for controlled subjects and a reflexive item for
local binding; a language without the null item has overt PRO.

## Main definitions

* `MinimalPronoun.Context`: the binding contexts an item can be conditioned on
* `MinimalPronoun.Form`: the shapes a minimal pronoun takes, null, pronominal or reflexive
* `MinimalPronoun.Vocabulary`: a language's items for minimal pronouns and its elsewhere form
* `Vocabulary.realize`, `Vocabulary.controlForm`: the form in a context, by the Subset Principle
* `Vocabulary.syncretic`: the contexts whose form is the referential pronoun's

## Main results

* `Vocabulary.some_realize`: the elsewhere form is the Subset Principle's elsewhere item
* `Vocabulary.realize_eq_elsewhere`: a context no item applies to gets the elsewhere form
* `Vocabulary.exists_null_item_of_controlForm_eq_null`: silent PRO needs a null item

## Implementation notes

The free, referential pronoun is not a context: it is what no context conditions, the elsewhere
form. The elsewhere form is a field of the vocabulary rather than an item, so that every
vocabulary realizes every context; `some_realize` identifies it with the empty-site item of
Distributed Morphology. Safir states the variation as shape conditions at Spell-Out; the
vocabulary-item formulation is Landau's and Ostrove's. The theory of control that consumes
minimal pronouns, Landau's two tiers, is in `Studies/Landau2015.lean`.
