# Spatial cases

A spatial case combines a localization with a direction, as Pantcheva decomposes them: the
interior, surface and exterior series of Finnish, Hungarian and Daghestanian local cases each
cross a localization with Place, Goal and Source. The general locative, allative, ablative and
perlative express a direction with no localization. Blake's types of case (Table 2.7) place
the spatial cases among the semantic cases, apart from the grammatical ones.

## Main definitions

* `Case.dirOf`, `Case.localizationOf`: the direction and the localization a spatial case
  expresses, if any.
* `Case.toCase`, `Case.spatialDecomp`: a spatial case from its localization and direction, and
  back.
* `Case.ofDir`: the localization-neutral case of a direction.
* `Case.shape?`: the shape of the paths a directional case expresses.
* `Case.Kind`, `Case.kind`: grammatical, spatial and other semantic cases.

## Main results

* `Case.spatialDecomp_toCase`: the decomposition round-trips on the localization-specific cells.
* `Case.dirOf_ofDir`: the localization-neutral case of a direction expresses it.
* `Case.kind_eq_spatial_iff`: the spatial cases are those with a direction.

## Implementation notes

Blake names the nominative, accusative, ergative, genitive and dative as grammatical cases;
`Case.kind` adds the absolutive, the oblique, the partitive and the vocative to them. The
terminative is a delimited goal, Pantcheva's *up to*.
