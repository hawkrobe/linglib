# Case

The comparative case values, the concepts under which the case systems of different languages
are compared. The cases of a language are its own categories and are not these values
([haspelmath-2010]): a fragment defines them as an inductive type `L.Case` and matches them to the
comparative values by two functions, `L.Case.label`, the value its traditional name corresponds
to, and, where the grammar lists more than the name, `L.Case.functions`, the values it expresses
([blake-2001] ch. 2). A language has a case when some word distinguishes it by form, and the other
words may realize it with the form of another case ([corbett-2008]), so a fragment with paradigms
proves that they separate its cases. The hierarchies and orders the literature places on the
comparative values are each stated where they are used: the containment orders in
`Syntax/Case/Order.lean` and Blake's hierarchy of case systems in `Studies/Blake1994.lean`.

The Universal Dependencies case tags are the corpus vocabulary, reached through
`Morphology/Word/UD.lean` ([de-marneffe-zeman-2021]). Every value realizes as a tag and every tag
ingests as a value. The oblique realizes as `Acc`, the tag UD's guidelines give the oblique of a
language with only a direct and an oblique case, and so ingests back as the accusative.
