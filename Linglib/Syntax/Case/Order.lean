# The containment order on Case

Caha takes the representation of a case to be a stack of nested feature shells, so that each case
on a hierarchy of cases contains the cases before it. The hierarchy here is the list
`containment` of the nominative, accusative, genitive, dative and locative, and one case is below
another when it comes earlier in the list, `[c₁, c₂] <+ containment`. The cases off the list, such
as the ergative, the absolutive and the instrumental, are comparable only to themselves. The order
is a scoped instance (`open scoped Case.Caha`), since a theoretical order is an opt-in commitment
and not an order on the inventory. McFadden's nonnominative cases, those containing the
accusative, are the natural class whose shared feature conditions the stem allomorphy that sets
the nominative apart, and the *ABA syncretism law over the order is the framework-neutral
`Morphology.IsContiguous`.

The directional containment of spatial cases, Place ⊂ Goal ⊂ Source ⊂ Route, is
`Spatial.PathDir`, and the decomposition of spatial cases into localization and direction is in
`Syntax/Case/Spatial.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `Case.containment`: the containment hierarchy.
* The scoped `PartialOrder Case` instance in `Case.Caha`: the containment order.
* `Case.IsNonnominative`: the cases containing the accusative.

## Main results

* `Case.IsNonnominative.mem_containment`: every nonnominative case is on the hierarchy.

## Implementation notes

The list is the start of Blake's hierarchy, nominative, accusative or ergative, genitive, dative,
locative, ablative or instrumental, along its accusative alignment and cut before the ablative and
instrumental, which share a position. McFadden takes Blake's hierarchy as Caha updates it, and
Aitha caps it with the postpositions, which the locative stands for here. Caha's own sequences
differ: his Universal Case sequence is nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental,
comitative, and his Russian order puts the prepositional between the genitive and the dative.
They are stated in `Studies/Caha2009.lean`.
