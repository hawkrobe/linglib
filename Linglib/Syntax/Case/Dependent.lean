# Dependent case

Structural case read off the arrangement of NPs in a domain, under a disjunctive hierarchy:
case a lexical head has valued is kept; otherwise an NP that c-commands a distinct caseless NP
in the domain takes the domain's high case and one c-commanded by such an NP its low case, the
two rules reading the same configuration, so a domain with both marks the higher NP and the
lower NP at once; whatever remains takes the domain's elsewhere case. Which of the two
dependent rules a clause has is its alignment: accusative, ergative, tripartite or neutral.
The passes are generic in what an NP is, so a phase-cyclic grammar can run them domain by
domain.

## Main definitions

* `Case.Mechanism`: what valued a case, a lexical head, a dependent rule, Agree, or the
  elsewhere case, shared by every account of case assignment.
* `Case.lexicalValuation`: the valuation of NPs by lexical case.
* `DependentCase.Rules`: the high, low and elsewhere cases of one domain, and
  `Rules.ofAlignment`, the rules of an alignment.
* `Rules.dependentPass`, `Rules.unmarkedPass`: the passes, over the NPs a predicate selects.
* `Rules.valuations`: the valuations the rules can assign.
* `Rules.assign`, `assignCases`: the one-domain algorithm, and its form for an alignment.

## Main results

* `Rules.dependentPass_high`, `Rules.dependentPass_low`, `Rules.dependentPass_alone`: what the
  dependent rules do to an NP with a caseless NP below it, above it, or neither.
* `Rules.extends_dependentPass`, `Rules.extends_unmarkedPass`, `Rules.extends_assign`: each pass
  extends the valuation by what the rules assign.
* `Rules.assign_length`: the algorithm is total.
* `Rules.assign_getElem?_of_some`: lexical case is kept, so it bleeds the dependent rules.
* `Rules.case_mem_cases`: a caseless NP is valued only with a case the rules mention.
* `Rules.assign_singleton`, `Rules.assign_pair`: the algorithm in closed form on domains of one
  and two NPs.
* `Rules.classifies_marking_ofAlignment`: the rules of an alignment mark S, A and P with that
  alignment.

## Implementation notes

List position encodes structural height: earlier is higher, and c-commands everything later.
The NPs are of any type, identified by that type rather than by a label; a study's NPs are
its own positions, and `Valuation.valueOf` reads off the case of one. The passes are
`Valuation.fill`, so what they share (totality, persistence of values) comes from
`Case.Valuation.Extends`.
