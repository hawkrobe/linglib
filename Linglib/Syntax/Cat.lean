# Syntactic categories

A syntactic category is a lexical category, named by its Universal Dependencies part of speech, or
the clause `S`, which projects from no head. A category carries no level of projection: a noun
phrase and the noun that heads it both have the category `N`, and whether a node is a minimal, an
intermediate or a maximal projection is read off the tree from its head daughters
(`Syntax/Tree/Projection.lean`). This is the category stripped of bar level that HPSG's head value
records. `PhraseStructure.Cat` is the default category type of `PhraseStructure.Tree`.

## Implementation notes

The complementizer `C` is `SCONJ`, the tag UD gives complementizers, and `Neg` is `PART`, the tag
of English *not* and of other particles.
