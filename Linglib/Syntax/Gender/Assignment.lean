# Gender assignment systems

This file defines an assignment system, the rules by which a language assigns its nouns to
genders, and its semantic core.

An assignment system reads a noun's meaning through semantic rules and its form through
formal rules, morphological or phonological; the semantic rules take precedence, the formal
rules sort the semantic residue, and the residue gender catches what neither covers. No
attested system is formal alone: every system assigns by meaning on some nonempty set of
nouns, its semantic core, which here is the set of nouns the semantic rules cover, so that
the core determines gender by meaning as a theorem rather than a stipulation.

## Main definitions

* `Gender.AssignmentSystem`: semantic rules, formal rules and a residue gender.
* `Gender.AssignmentSystem.assign`: the gender of a noun under the rules, in order.
* `Gender.AssignmentSystem.IsStrictSemantic`: a system with no formal rules.
* `Gender.AssignmentSystem.semanticCore`: the nouns the semantic rules cover.

## Main results

* `Gender.AssignmentSystem.assign_of_formal`: a formal rule decides only in the semantic
  residue.
* `Gender.AssignmentSystem.factorsThroughOn_semanticCore`: on the semantic core, gender is
  a function of meaning.
* `Gender.AssignmentSystem.factorsThrough_of_isStrictSemantic`: in a strict semantic system,
  gender is a function of meaning everywhere.

## Implementation notes

The system is typed by the meaning `σ` its semantic rules read and the form `φ` its formal
rules read; a language's fragment supplies the maps from nouns to both. The rules are total
functions to an optional gender, so their order of application is fixed by construction.
