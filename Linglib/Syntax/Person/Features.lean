# Bivalent person features

Person decomposes into two features, [participant] and [author], the bivalent system Ackema and
Neeleman trace to Halle. Read on participant sets, [participant] holds of the nonempty ones and
[author] of those containing the speaker, so the participant sets and the features form a formal
context (`Person.Bears`). A value's bundle is the set of features holding of all its participant
sets, its intent in the context. Every set containing the speaker is nonempty, so the closed sets of
features are exactly the lower sets of the chain participant < author: the containment filter
that rules out an author who is no participant is the closure of the context. Harley and Ritter
caution that a geometry encodes morphological dependency, which need not follow logical
implication, so the chain stays a stipulated order, and its coincidence with the closure is a
theorem about person. Two features see the tripartition and not clusivity: a tripartition value
covers exactly the participant sets whose own features are its bundle.

## Main definitions

* `Person.Feature`: the two features, ordered participant < author.
* `Person.Bears`: the features a participant set bears.
* `Person.toFeatures`: the bundle of a person value.
* `Person.prominence`: the top of a value's bundle, the person hierarchy.
* `Person.Category.toFeatures`: the bundle of a referential category.

## Main results

* `Person.wellFormed_iff_isIntent`: the well-formed bundles are the closed sets of the context.
* `Person.card_wellFormed`: there are three well-formed bundles, so no fourth person.
* `Person.mem_participantSets_iff`: a tripartition value covers the participant sets whose
  features are its bundle.
* `Person.toFeatures_sup`: the bundle of a coordination is the union of its conjuncts' bundles.
* `Person.mem_toFeatures_iff`: a value bears exactly the features up to its prominence.
* `Person.prominence_le_iff`: prominence is the order resolution induces up to clusivity.
* `Person.prominence_le_iff_subset`: prominence orders values by inclusion of their bundles.
* `Person.Category.sharedPerson_isSome_iff`: a set of categories has a person iff they share a
  bundle.

/-! ### Prominence

A bundle is a lower set of the chain participant < author, so it is determined by its top
feature, and ordering values by their tops is the person hierarchy 1 > 2 > 3. It is the order
coordination induces up to clusivity: a coordination takes the person of its most prominent
conjunct, as Zwicky's hierarchy of reference and Corbett's resolution rules state. -/
