# The lattice of persons

A person value covers the referents whose participants form one of its participant sets
(`Person.participantSets`). As Zwicky proposes, a
coordination refers to the union of its conjuncts' referents, so its participant sets are the
pairwise unions `⊻` of theirs. Distinct values cover distinct participant sets, so this makes
`Person` a join-semilattice whose join `⊔` is person resolution, with third person at the bottom
and the impersonal at the top. Dalrymple and Kaplan's marker sets are the participant sets of the
quadripartition, and their union is the join (`Person.ofParticipants_union`).

## Main definitions

* the `SemilatticeSup Person` instance: person resolution as the join.

## Main results

* `Person.participantSets_sup`: the participant sets of a join are the pairwise unions.
* `Person.ofParticipants_union`: the person of a union of participant sets is the join of their
  persons.
* `Person.coarsen_eq_iff`: coarsening sends a value to the tripartition value covering it.
* `Person.prominence_le_iff`: prominence is the order resolution induces up to clusivity.

## Implementation notes

The impersonal covers no participant set, so a coordination with an impersonal conjunct has no
referential person; making `zero` absorbing records this and keeps every law unconditional.
