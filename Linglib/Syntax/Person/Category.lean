# Referential person categories

This file defines the eight referential person categories. A category is a configuration of
the speech-act participants a referent contains and of the others it contains, none, one or
several: the three singular participants and the five attested groups. The two groups this
excludes, several speakers and an audience with no one else, are the configurations
`Category.WellFormed` rejects.

## Main definitions

* `Person.Category`: the eight categories.
* `Category.toConfig`: the configuration of a category, a bijection onto the well-formed ones.
* `Category.IsSingular`, `Category.IsGroup`, `Category.IsFirstPersonComplex`,
  `Category.IsInclusive`: the classes of categories read off the configuration.
* `Category.person`: the person projection, keeping clusivity on the groups.
* `Category.ofPersonNumber`: the categories a (person, number) coordinate pair realizes.
* `Category.sharedPerson`, `Category.sharedNumber`: the coordinates a set of categories
  shares, neutral values where they differ.

## Main results

* `Category.toConfig_bijective`: the categories are exactly the well-formed configurations.
* `Category.ofPersonNumber_person`: every category is recovered from its person at some number.

/-- A configuration of participants and others is a category iff it is nonempty and has
several others only on their own. The speaker and the addressee are unique individuals, so a
group of speakers or of addressees does not arise, and a participant with one other or with
several forms one group. -/

theorem person_separates_clusivity :
    Category.speakerAddresseeOthers.person ≠ Category.speakerOthers.person := by decide +kernel

/-- The categories a (person, number) coordinate pair can realize. Clusivity rides on the
person value and the minimal/augmented coordinates give the minimal/augmented inclusives
directly (Tagalog *kata* = `(firstInclusive, minimal)` ↦ `{speakerAddressee}`). A
clusivity-unmarked non-singular first person is the syncretism
`{speakerAddressee, speakerAddresseeOthers, speakerOthers}` (English *we*), general number is
noncommittal between the singular and the group category (`(second, general)` ↦
`{addressee, addresseeOthers}`), and a singular bearing clusivity or the impersonal person
realizes nothing. -/

/-! ### The person and number of a set of categories

A form that can denote several categories, the polite German *Sie* for an addressee or
addressees or English *we* for any group containing the speaker, has a person and a number
only up to the values neutral between them, the clusivity-unmarked `first` and the
noncommittal `general`. -/

/-- The person shared by a set of referential categories: the common value of `person` where
there is one, `first` for categories differing only in clusivity, `none` for the empty set and
for categories disagreeing on the speech-act roles they include. -/
def sharedPerson (s : Finset Category) : Option Person :=
  if s = ∅ then none
  else if ∀ c ∈ s, c.IncludesSpeaker then
    if ∀ c ∈ s, c.person = .firstInclusive then some .firstInclusive
    else if ∀ c ∈ s, c.person = .firstExclusive then some .firstExclusive
    else some .first
  else if ∀ c ∈ s, c.IncludesAddressee then some .second
  else if ∀ c ∈ s, ¬ c.IncludesSpeaker ∧ ¬ c.IncludesAddressee then some .third
  else none

/-- The number shared by a set of referential categories: singular or plural when the
categories agree, `general` when they mix individuals and groups, `none` for the empty set.
Cysouw's categories do not separate dual from plural, so the projection is at that
granularity. -/
def sharedNumber (s : Finset Category) : Option Number :=
  if s = ∅ then none
  else if ∀ c ∈ s, c.IsSingular then some .singular
  else if ∀ c ∈ s, c.IsGroup then some .plural
  else some .general

/-- A single category shares its own person. -/
theorem sharedPerson_singleton (c : Category) : sharedPerson {c} = some c.person := by
  cases c <;> decide

/-- The categories a coordinate pair realizes share that person, wherever there are any. -/
theorem sharedPerson_ofPersonNumber (p : Person) (n : Number)
    (h : (ofPersonNumber p n).Nonempty) : sharedPerson (ofPersonNumber p n) = some p := by
  revert h; revert p n; decide

/-- The categories a coordinate pair realizes share the general number only at general
number. -/
theorem sharedNumber_ofPersonNumber_eq_general (p : Person) (n : Number)
    (h : sharedNumber (ofPersonNumber p n) = some .general) : n = .general := by
  revert h; revert p n; decide
