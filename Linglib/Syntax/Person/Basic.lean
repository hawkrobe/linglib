# Grammatical person

`Person` is the inventory of values that languages' person systems distinguish, clusivity among
them. Harbour's quadripartition, first exclusive, first inclusive, second and third, sits beside
the tripartition's `first`, the first person unmarked for clusivity (English *we*), to which
`coarsen` sends both clusivity values as coarsening sends `Number.dual` to `Number.plural`. The
impersonal is not a value but the absence of one, `Option Person`, as the Universal Dependencies
tag `Person=0` is ingested (`Morphology/Word/UD.lean`). A value means the participant sets its
referents can have (`Person.participantSets`), and whether it includes the speaker, is a
speech-act participant, or marks clusivity is read off them.

The person hierarchy 1 > 2 > 3, the hierarchy of reference and coordination of Zwicky, Corbett,
and Dalrymple and Kaplan, is `Person.prominence`, the top of a value's feature bundle
(`Syntax/Person/Features.lean`). It is not the only person scale:
Zwicky distinguishes morphosyntactic hierarchies that order the participants otherwise, as
Algonquian ranks the second person above the first, and for argument coding splits Haspelmath's
person scale is the binary cut between participants and the rest (`Person.Class`).

## Main definitions

* `Person`: the inventory.
* `Person.participantSets`: the participant sets a value covers.
* `Person.ofParticipants`: the value covering exactly one participant set.
* `Person.IncludesSpeaker`, `Person.IsSAP`, `Person.MarksClusivity`: predicates read off the
  participant sets.
* `Person.coarsen`: the value without its clusivity.

/-! ### Participant sets

A person value covers the referents whose participants, the speaker and the addressee among them,
form one of its participant sets: `{speaker}` or `{speaker, addressee}` for the first person
unmarked for clusivity and a single set for each value of the quadripartition. The predicates on
values read these sets off. -/

/-! ### Coarsening

The clusivity values coarsen to the tripartition's `first`, as `Number.dual` coarsens to
`Number.plural`, so a system without clusivity realizes inclusive and exclusive referents
alike. -/

/-- `coarsen` collapses clusivity, sending a value marking clusivity to the first person and
keeping every other value. -/
def coarsen (p : Person) : Person := if p.MarksClusivity then .first else p

    p.coarsen.coarsen = p.coarsen := by revert p; decide

/-- Coarsening erases exactly the clusivity marking. -/
