# Constraints

This file defines the violable constraints of Optimality Theory ([prince-smolensky-1993]), which
Harmonic Grammar, MaxEnt and optimality-theoretic work in syntax and semantics adopt. A constraint
is a function `C → ℕ` that counts the violations of each candidate. It stores no name and no
faithfulness or markedness tag, since a constraint is its evaluation function. The
faithfulness–markedness distinction is a structural property of correspondence candidates
(`OptimalityTheory.Correspondence`), where markedness factors through the output and faithfulness
vanishes on the identity candidate, and a constraint over an opaque candidate type has no family.

## Main definitions

* `OptimalityTheory.Constraint C`: a violation-counting function `C → ℕ`.
* `Constraint.binary`: the indicator constraint of a decidable predicate.
* `Constraint.comap`, `ConstraintSet.comap`: the pullback of a constraint or constraint set along
  a candidate map.
* `ConstraintSet C ι`: a grammar's constraint set, CON, a family of constraints indexed by `ι`.
* `Constraint.joint`, `ConstraintSet.joint`: joint evaluation on output tuples by constraint
  summation.

The Harmonic Grammar scores of a constraint set are in `HarmonicGrammar/Harmony.lean`.

/-- An OT or Harmonic-Grammar **constraint** is a function counting the violations of each
candidate. Whether it is a faithfulness or a markedness constraint is a structural property (see
`OptimalityTheory.Correspondence`), not a stored tag. -/

variable {C D : Type*}

/-- The **binary** constraint of a decidable predicate `P` assigns one violation when `P c`
holds and none otherwise. Every binary markedness or faithfulness constraint has this shape, and
which of the two it is follows from its structure, not from the constructor. -/

@[simp] theorem Constraint.binary_apply (P : C → Prop) [DecidablePred P] (c : C) :

theorem Constraint.binary_le_one (P : C → Prop) [DecidablePred P] (c : C) :

/-- A binary constraint is satisfied exactly when its predicate fails. -/

  simp [Constraint.binary]

/-- The anti-faithfulness constraint `¬F` of a constraint `F` ([alderete-2001]) is satisfied
exactly when `F` is violated at least once, so it demands one violation and no more. -/
def Constraint.antifaithful (F : Constraint C) : Constraint C := Constraint.binary (F · = 0)

/-- The pullback of a `D`-constraint along `f : C → D` evaluates it on the image of each
candidate, so a specific candidate type can reuse a constraint defined on a more general one. -/

/-! ### Joint evaluation

A **systemic** constraint — \*HOMOPHONY, a distinctiveness constraint — scores a
whole system of outputs, so its candidate is an output tuple `f : κ → O` assigning
each input `inputs i` its output. A per-mapping constraint on `I × O` is lifted to
output tuples by **constraint summation** ([prince-2015], [magri-storme-2021]), which
sums its violations on `f` over the mappings `(inputs i, f i)`. -/

variable {κ I O : Type*} [Fintype κ]

/-- The joint evaluation of a per-mapping constraint on an output tuple sums its violations
over the mappings `(inputs i, f i)`. -/
def Constraint.joint (inputs : κ → I) (con : Constraint (I × O)) : Constraint (κ → O) :=
  fun f => ∑ i, con (inputs i, f i)

@[simp] theorem Constraint.joint_apply (inputs : κ → I) (con : Constraint (I × O)) (f : κ → O) :
    con.joint inputs f = ∑ i, con (inputs i, f i) := rfl

/-- A grammar's **constraint set**, CON in [prince-smolensky-1993], is a family of constraints over
candidates `C` indexed by the constraint names `ι`. An OT grammar ranks it (a `Ranking ι n`), a
Harmonic Grammar weights its violations by a vector `ι → ℝ`, and MaxEnt takes the softmax of the
resulting harmonies. A constraint set written as a vector `![C₀, …]` is indexed by `Fin n`. -/
