# Harmonic Serialism — The Combinator
[mccarthy-2000] [mccarthy-2010] [pruitt-2023]
[lamont-2022a] [lamont-2022b]

Bundles a one-step `gen` function and a constraint ranking into an
`HSDerivation`. Owns the serial GEN/EVAL iteration combinator (§ 1 — a
bespoke fuel-bounded search; the generic fixed-point / well-founded-
termination theory it instantiates is mathlib's) and reuses the existing
parallel `Tableau`/`mkTableau` machinery from `Basic.lean` (Layered
Grounding — does not duplicate parallel optimization).

## NOTE on theoretical scope

Per [pruitt-2023] (Table 1): HS does **not** solve counterfeeding
underapplication, and only patches counterbleeding overapplication with
extra GEN assumptions. This file's docstring deliberately does not claim
HS is "the serial OT solution to opacity" — that would misrepresent the
field's current understanding. HS is one constraint-based serial framework
with mixed empirical record; [mcpherson-lamont-2026] is the
motivating positive case for the directional variant of HS
([lamont-2022b]). For counterfeeding cases linglib offers
`Phonology/Subregular/LocalRewrite.lean` (extrinsic ordering of
local rewrite rules; subregular-grounded per [chandlee-heinz-2018])
and `Phonology/OptimalityTheory/Stratal.lean` (cyclic ranking)
as architecturally-distinct alternatives.

## Sibling architectures

OT has multiple "more than one EVAL call" specializations, all sharing
the parallel-OT primitives in `Basic.lean`:

| Theory                        | Ranking across calls | Candidate across calls |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Parallel OT (`Basic.lean`)    | n/a (single call)    | n/a                    |
| Stratal OT (`Stratal.lean`) | varies per stratum   | chained via `bridge`   |
| HS (this file)                | **durable**          | iterated via `gen`     |
| Stratal HS (not yet)          | varies per stratum   | iterated within stratum |

HS and Stratal OT are **sister specializations**, not nested: HS holds
ranking constant and varies the candidate; Stratal OT varies the ranking
and chains the candidate. Stratal HS combines both axes and is
deferred (cf. [pruitt-2023] §2.4).

## Sibling, not refactor

This module does **not** modify `NamedConstraint` or `Tableau`
(load-bearing for `Weighted.lean`/`MaxEnt.lean`/`NoisyHG.lean` and ~30
study files). The `stepOptimum` function builds an inner `Tableau` and
reuses `Tableau.optimal` directly. Future directional dispatch
([lamont-2022b]; [eisner-2000]) will land as a sibling
`DirectionalTableau` consumer; deliberately not stubbed here, to avoid
silently routing directional callers to the parallel optimum.

-- ============================================================================

/-! The bespoke part of Harmonic Serialism, which mathlib has no off-the-shelf
form of: a fuel-bounded search that iterates `eval ∘ gen` to a fixed point,
picking a representative of the optimal set at each step. The *general* theory
it instantiates is mathlib's — `Function.IsFixedPt`, `Order.FixedPoints`
(Knaster–Tarski), `WellFounded` descent; the `Nat` fuel and `pick` selector
here are what make a possibly-non-terminating, possibly-tied search total and
computable. -/

    element of the optimal set (a canonical sort + `head?`, or a directional
    tie-breaker). Returns `none` if `pick` fails or the optimal set is empty
    along the way. The `Nat` bound makes the function total — HS need not

    well-founded and every genuine step produces a strictly more harmonic
    candidate (`sound`), then `iterateGen` is **eventually constant**: some `N`
    past which further iterations don't change the result. This is the
    structural justification for HS as a search — derivations can't loop while
    each step makes measurable progress, so the explicit `Nat` bound is

/-! Directional HS ([lamont-2022b]): the constraint hierarchy is a
    list of `DirectionalConstraint C`, evaluated via `DirectionalTableau`
    under a chosen `EvalMode`. Sibling to the parallel `HSDerivation`
    above; the two are not unified because their constraint types
    differ (`NamedConstraint C` for parallel vs `DirectionalConstraint C`
    for directional) and weighted aggregation is theoretically incoherent
    with directional EVAL (per Lamont 2022b).

    The motivating consumer is paper, fig. 3 (`/kāk^H + rī^H + dō^H/`):
    parallel HS produces a divergent tie among three deletion candidates;
    directional `*FLOAT^→` breaks the tie by requiring leftmost-first
    deletion. -/
