# Harmonic Serialism
[mccarthy-2000] [mccarthy-2010] [pruitt-2023] [lamont-2022a] [lamont-2022b]

Harmonic Serialism: iterate a one-step `gen` and a durable constraint ranking to a
fixed point. `HSDerivation` bundles the two; the serial search itself is `iterateGen`,
`Function.iterate` of a one-round map `hsStep` on `Option C` whose fixed points are
exactly convergence and failure — durability of both is mathlib's `IsFixedPt.iterate`;
the `Nat` fuel and the `pick` tie-breaker make a possibly-non-terminating,
possibly-tied search total and computable. One-step EVAL
reuses the parallel `Tableau` machinery; directional EVAL ([lamont-2022b];
[eisner-2000]) needs nothing extra — a directional constraint like `*FLOAT^→` is a
position-indexed scalar block (`Tone.starFloatBlock`) spliced into the ranking under
the canonical lex order.

## Main definitions

* `hsStep` / `iterateGen`: one total round of the search (convergence and failure are
  its fixed points), and its `n`-fold `Function.iterate`.
* `HSDerivation`: a one-step `gen` with a durable ranking; `stepOptimum` is one
  GEN/EVAL round, `Converged` the halting condition, `derive` the bundled search.

## Main results

* `iterateGen_eventually_constant`: under a well-founded harmony order that every
  genuine step descends, the search is eventually constant — derivations cannot loop
  while each step makes measurable progress, so the fuel bound is harmless.
* `isFixedPt_singleton_iff_converged`: `Converged` is `Function.IsFixedPt` of the
  powerset step at the singleton.
* `converged_of_singleton_gen`: GEN-restriction to the faithful candidate forces
  convergence.

## Theoretical scope

Per [pruitt-2023] (Table 1), HS does **not** solve counterfeeding underapplication and
only patches counterbleeding with extra GEN assumptions; this file makes no
"serial OT solves opacity" claim. [mcpherson-lamont-2026] is the motivating positive
case for the directional variant. Architecturally distinct alternatives in linglib:
`Phonology/Subregular/LocalRewrite.lean` (extrinsic rule ordering) and
`Phonology/OptimalityTheory/Stratal.lean` (cyclic ranking). HS and Stratal OT are
sister specializations of parallel OT, not nested: HS holds the ranking constant and
iterates the candidate; Stratal OT varies the ranking and chains the candidate
(Stratal HS, combining both axes, is deferred — cf. [pruitt-2023] §2.4).

section Iteration

variable {C : Type*} [DecidableEq C]

/-- One total round of the serial search: a converged form (`step c = {c}`) returns
itself, any other advances by `pick`ing from the step's output (a canonical sort +
`head?`, or a directional tie-breaker), and failure — an empty pick, or an already
failed search — is `none`. Convergence and failure are both fixed points, so the
`n`-round search is literally `Function.iterate` of this map. -/

  oc.bind fun c => if step c = {c} then some c else pick (step c)

total — HS need not converge ([lamont-2022b]). -/

/-- **HS terminates under a well-founded harmony order.** If every genuine step
descends a well-founded `lt` (`sound`), the search is eventually constant: some `N`
past which further fuel doesn't change the result. Derivations cannot loop while each
step makes measurable progress, so the explicit `Nat` bound is harmless. The proof is
`WellFounded.iterate_eventually_constant` over the harmony order lifted to `Option`. -/
