# Natural classes

This file defines the natural classes of an inventory. In Hayes's definition a natural class
is any complete set of sounds of a language that share the same value for a feature or set of
features, so that /p t k/ are the voiceless stops of English and not of Persian, which has /q/
as well. A feature description is an underspecified segment `d`, a segment `x` has the values
of `d` when `d ≤ x`, and the natural class of `d` in an inventory is the set of its members
above `d`.

What the segments of a set share is their meet, the description Albright and Hayes's minimal
generalization reduces two differing segments to. The natural class of that meet is the
smallest natural class containing the set. A set of segments is a natural class when it is
that smallest class, and it then has a description. It fails to be one when every description
its members meet is met by some other segment of the inventory as well.

## Main definitions

* `Phonology.Segment.naturalClass`: the members of an inventory that have the values of a
  description.
* `Phonology.IsNaturalClass`: a nonempty set of segments is the natural class of some
  description.

## Main results

* `Phonology.Segment.subset_naturalClass_iff`: a set lies in the natural class of `d` exactly
  when `d` is below each of its members, the Galois connection between sets of segments and
  descriptions.
* `Phonology.Segment.naturalClass_inf'_subset_iff`: the natural class of what a set shares is
  the smallest natural class containing the set.
* `Phonology.isNaturalClass_iff`: a set is a natural class exactly when it is the natural
  class of what its members share, which makes the property decidable.

## Implementation notes

Descriptions are ordered by subsumption and natural classes by inclusion, and the two maps
`naturalClass` and `Finset.inf'` form an antitone Galois connection, which is that of formal
concept analysis for the relation `d ≤ x`. The meet of the empty set would be an inconsistent
description, which `Segment` lacks, so the statements about meets are for nonempty sets, and
a natural class is nonempty by definition.
