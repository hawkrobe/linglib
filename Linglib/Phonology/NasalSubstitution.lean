# Nasal place assimilation and nasal substitution

This file defines the assimilation of a nasal to the place of a following consonant, and nasal
substitution, in which the consonant is in addition not realized.

Many Austronesian languages have prefixes that end in a nasal. The nasal takes the place of a
stem-initial obstruent, and in nasal substitution the two surface as one nasal at that place, as
in Tagalog *mamigáj* from *maŋ-* and *bigáj*. Following Donohue, substitution is assimilation
together with the loss of the obstruent. A language fixes which consonants trigger assimilation
and which substitute.

## Main definitions

* `placeAssimilation`: a nasal takes the place class of a following segment of a trigger class.
* `nonstrident`, `nonlateral`, `defaultPlace`: the rules that keep the assimilated nasal a
  possible nasal.
* `assimilate`: the four rules in sequence, over a whole word.
* `substitute`: the nasal that a nasal and a following consonant surface as under substitution.

## Main results

* `length_assimilate`, `length_substitute`: assimilation preserves the length of a word, and
  substitution yields one segment.

## Implementation notes

The place class contains [strident] and [lateral], which the PHOIBLE chart specifies on coronals
alone. A nasal assimilated to a sibilant or a lateral copies `+` for them, so `nonstrident` and
`nonlateral` reset it, and a nasal assimilated to a consonant with no oral articulator, such as
a glottal stop, loses its place, which `defaultPlace` restores.
