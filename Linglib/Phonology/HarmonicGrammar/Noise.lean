# Noisy harmonic grammar

Boersma and Pater make harmonic grammar stochastic by adding independent Gaussian noise to every
constraint weight at each evaluation, so that a candidate wins with the probability that its noisy
harmony is the highest. Flemming reads this as a random utility model whose utilities are the
noisy harmonies. The candidates share the weights, so their noisy harmonies are correlated, and the
model is the choice rule `choiceProb` at the pushforward of the weight noise rather than at a
product of independent laws. The harmony difference of two candidates is Gaussian with variance
`v * (d ⬝ᵥ d)` for their violation difference `d`, so how noisy a comparison is depends on the
violation profile and not only on the harmonies, unlike in MaxEnt, where the utilities are
independent.

## Main definitions

* `weightNoise`: independent `N(0, v)` noise on every constraint weight.
* `weightNoiseChoiceProb`: the probability that a candidate has the highest harmony under noisy
  weights.

## Main results

* `weightNoiseChoiceProb_eq_choiceProb_map`: noisy harmonic grammar is the random utility model
  whose joint law is that of the noisy harmonies.
* `map_weightNoise_harmonyScore_sub`: the harmony difference of two candidates is Gaussian with
  variance `v * (d ⬝ᵥ d)`.
* `variance_harmonyScore_sub`, `covariance_harmonyScore_sub`: the variances and covariances of
  the harmony differences.
* `weightNoise_setOf_harmonyScore_lt`, `weightNoiseChoiceProb_of_forall_ne_eq`,
  `weightNoiseChoiceProb_fin_two`: the probability that one candidate beats another is the probit
  of their harmony difference over its standard deviation.

## Implementation notes

The noise has variance `v : ℝ≥0`, as in mathlib's `gaussianReal`; Boersma and Pater take `v = 1`.
Flemming's normal MaxEnt, with independent Gaussian noise on the candidates' harmonies, needs no
definition: it is `choiceProb (Measure.pi fun c ↦ gaussianReal (harmonyScore con w c) v)`, with
binary case `choiceProb_pi_gaussianReal`. His censored variant, which clamps noisy weights at zero,
has no closed form and is not formalized.
