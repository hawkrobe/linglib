# Intersecting constraint families

Two constraint families intersect ([zuraw-hayes-2017]) when a variable process is conditioned by
two binary factors and each constraint is sensitive to at most one of them: arranging the four
underlying forms that cross the factors into a square, each constraint is insensitive to the rows
or to the columns, at every candidate (§2.4 of [magri-2025]). [zuraw-hayes-2017] and
[hayes-2022] observe that the rates of application to the four forms then fit two shifted
sigmoids at shared abscissas. [magri-2025] restates the generalization on logit rates: the
difference between the logit rates of two forms in one row does not depend on the row (13).
Equivalently, the interaction contrast of the logit rates on the square vanishes; this file
states the generalization so, as the kernel of a linear functional.

A function of a form's violations that is a sum of per-constraint terms has zero interaction
whenever the families intersect, since each term is insensitive to one dimension. The MaxEnt
log-odds of two candidates is such a sum, the weighted violation differences, so MaxEnt predicts
the generalization for every weighting and every candidate set.

## Main definitions

* `HarmonicGrammar.Square`: four underlying forms crossing two binary factors, (12) of
  [magri-2025].
* `Square.interaction`: the interaction contrast `f tl - f tr - f bl + f br`, a linear
  functional on the functions of the forms.
* `Square.InsensitiveToRow`, `Square.InsensitiveToCol`, `Square.Independent`: the independence
  of the rows and columns relative to a constraint set.

## Main results

* `Square.Independent.interaction_sum_eq_zero`: under independence, a sum of per-constraint terms
  has zero interaction.
* `Square.Independent.interaction_logOdds_softmax`: MaxEnt predicts the generalization, (22) of
  [magri-2025].
