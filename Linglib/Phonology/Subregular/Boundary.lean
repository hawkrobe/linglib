# Subregular Languages: Boundary Augmentation

Boundary augmentation of strings and a boundary-vacuity predicate relating the
chain-membership of a padded string to that of its unpadded core. The strictly-local,
locally-testable, and tier-relativized classes are built on this infrastructure
[lambert-2022] [heinz-rogers-2010] [rogers-pullum-2011]. The contiguous `k`-factors
the hierarchy quantifies over are a generic list combinator and live in
`Core/Data/List/Factors.lean` (`List.kFactors`).

## Main definitions

* `Augmented α`: boundary-augmented strings `List (Option α)`,
  with `none` the boundary marker.
* `boundary k w`: `w` injected into `Augmented α` and padded with
  `k - 1` boundary markers on each side.
* `IsBoundaryVacuous R`: `R` holds whenever either argument is the
  boundary marker `none`.

## Main results

* `IsBoundaryVacuous.isChain_boundary_two_iff`: boundary padding does
  not change `IsChain`-membership for a boundary-vacuous relation.

## Implementation notes

The standard subregular convention extends the alphabet with two edge markers
`⋊`, `⋉` and studies the `k`-factors of `⋊ᵏ⁻¹ · w · ⋉ᵏ⁻¹`. We instead use the
one-fresh-symbol extension `Option α` (`none` = boundary, `some a` = original
symbol): a single marker suffices because boundary symbols only ever occur at
fixed positions, so the two edges are never confused.

/-! ### Position discrimination and windows

Entries of `boundary k y` are integer-indexed entries of the word (`w[i]?` with `i : ℤ`, blank
outside `[0, w.length)`), shifted by the pad width; consequently the `k`-factors of the augmented
word are exactly its windows (`window`). -/

/-! ### Boundary-vacuous relations -/

/-- A relation on `Option α` is **boundary-vacuous** when `none` satisfies it on
either side (`R none u`, `R u none`) — so only `(some a, some b)` pairs can
witness a violation. Subregular edge constraints (OCP, no-clash, no-lapse) all
share this shape. -/
