# Tonal surfacing processes

A **surfacing process** bundles the analysis [jardine-2016a] gives tone-string maps: a
marked tone value, and a context predicate `Surfaces w i` saying position `i` of `w`
surfaces with it. The induced rewrite `Surfacing.map` writes the marked tone exactly at
the surfacing positions and the default elsewhere; `Surfacing.support` is the surfacing
set. Owning the context predicate on the process is what lets rival processes coexist:
unbounded tonal plateauing (`Tone.utp`) and Copperbelt Bemba high-tone
spreading (`Studies/Yolyan2025`) instantiate the same structure with very different
predicates — plateauing's is convex and its map a closure operator, spreading's is
neither — so only the genuinely shared API lives here.

The laws are the shared minimum: surfacing positions are in-domain (`lt_length`), the
marked tone is faithful — an underlying marked tone always surfaces (`surfaces_of_hi`) —
and the two written values are distinct (`hi_ne_lo`), which makes the pointwise
characterizations (`map_getElem?_hi_iff`, `map_getElem?_lo_iff`) read the map exactly.

A surfacing process writes the default at every non-surfacing position, which is the whole
story over a two-letter alphabet; over a richer alphabet the general positional rewrite is
`Subregular.Docking`, which docks a change at the positions its context picks out and keeps
the rest, and a surfacing process on a two-letter word is the case `Surfacing.toDocking`
(`Surfacing.toDocking_map`).

## Main definitions

* `Surfacing`, `Surfacing.map`, `Surfacing.support` — the process, its rewrite and its
  surfacing set.
* `Surfacing.toDocking` — a surfacing process as a docking process.
