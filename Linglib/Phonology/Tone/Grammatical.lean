# Grammatical tone

Grammatical tone is a tonological operation restricted to a specific morpheme or construction,
or a natural class of them, and not attributable to the general tonal phonology
([lionnet-mcpherson-rolle-2022], [rolle-2018]). This file gives [rolle-2018]'s vocabulary for
it over strings of tone-bearing units: the **grammatical tune** that covaries with the
construction, anchored at an edge of its host, and the four **dominance effects** by which a
trigger's tune interacts with the tones of its target-host. A dominant trigger imposes its
pattern whatever the target's tones, a recessive one only on an unvalued target, and a neutral
one leaves the target to the general phonology. Dominance is the neutralisation of the target's
valued–unvalued contrast, which [rolle-2018] calls transparadigmatic uniformity, and
`Dominance.isDominant_iff_uniform` derives his classification from it.

## Main definitions

* `TBU`, `TBU.IsValued` — a tone-bearing unit with its tonal root node, valued when the node
  is specified.
* `Tune`, `Tune.realize` — a grammatical tune, a melody anchored at an edge of the host, and
  its realisation over a number of units: one tone per unit from the anchored edge, the last
  tone reached spreading over the remainder.
* `overwrite`, `unvalue` — replacement of a host's tones by a tune, and their deletion.
* `Uniform` — transparadigmatic uniformity of an operation on hosts.
* `Dominance`, `Dominance.apply` — [rolle-2018]'s replacive-dominant, subtractive-dominant,
  recessive, and neutral triggers, and the automatic operation each performs on its
  target-host.

## Main results

* `overwrite_unvalue` — overwriting erases: a host and its unvalued projection are overwritten
  alike.
* `Dominance.isDominant_iff_uniform` — a trigger is dominant exactly when its operation is
  uniform across targets of the same segments.

## Implementation notes

A tone-bearing unit carries one root node, so contours are not represented and a tune longer
than its host is truncated at the anchored edge. The valuation window is coextensive with the
host, Rolle's default; local windows are not modelled. The neutral trigger's tune floats and
its docking is left to the general phonology, so its automatic operation is the identity on
the host. Which edge a tune anchors at is a property of the construction:
[akinbo-fwangwar-2026]'s M-H verbaliser anchors right, putting H on the final unit and M on the
rest.

markedness of the tune nor from its position relative to the target ([inkelas-1998]); the
terms are those of the accentual morphology of [kiparsky-halle-1977]. -/
