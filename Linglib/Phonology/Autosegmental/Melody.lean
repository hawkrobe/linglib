# Lexical melodies

This file defines the melody of a morpheme, its underlying autosegmental contribution as a
form built from lists.

A melody consists of the autosegments and slots that one morpheme sponsors, with its lexical
pre-linking in melody-local coordinates. Pre-linking is a matter of analysis. A melody with
no lines is the universally unlinked underlying form of harmonic serialism, and a partially
linked one is a stratal form such as `/M^H/`. The valued, unvalued, and floating
autosegments of Rolle's typology of grammatical tone are the linked slots, the unlinked
slots, and the floating autosegments of a candidate. A word is the product of the melodies
of its morphemes in the concatenation monoid, as in the Generalized Nonlinear Affixation
program.

## Main definitions

* `Form.melody`: the form of one morpheme's autosegments, slots, and pre-links, the
  pre-links given as pairs of natural numbers.

## Implementation notes

Consistency of Exponence, that GEN never alters morphemic affiliation, holds by the typing of
`Candidate`, whose tiers are those of its form.
