# Prosodic words (ω)
[selkirk-1980] [nespor-vogel-1986] [liberman-prince-1977] [hayes-1995] [ito-mester-2009]
[mccarthy-prince-1993] [selkirk-1996] [ito-mester-2003] [prince-smolensky-1993] [dolatian-2020]

A prosodic word ω is a node of the prosodic tree (`Prosody.Tree`), and well-formedness is
a *declarative* property of that carrier rather than a separate inductive. `IsWord` carves
out the well-formed ω-trees as the **Strict-Layer** core ([selkirk-1996]): an ω-node whose
daughters are only feet, recursive sub-words (ω-over-ω), or stray (unfooted) syllables — the
inviolable **Layeredness** constraint (no φ/ι/AP inside an ω). The library's OT studies
score raw `Tree` candidates, so `Word := {t : Tree // IsWord t}` is exactly the carrier
restricted to the legal recursive words.

`Exhaustivity` and `No-Recursion` are *violable* OT constraints, not part of `IsWord`: a
stray σ (a free clitic) and an ω-over-ω (the extended prosodic word of [ito-mester-2009])
are both admitted. They are scored on the carrier by `parseInto`/`noRec` and ranked by a
grammar — that is where they belong. Headedness (that an ω dominates a foot, the minimal-word
effect of [selkirk-1996]) is the typical case but is *not* presupposed: footless languages
have ω directly over σ (DeLisi 2015, per [dolatian-2020]), and the OT recursion candidates
here abstract the foot level. Prominence-head marking is likewise a refinement, not enforced.

## Main definitions

* `isFootTree` / `isWordTree` — structural `Bool` well-formedness checkers (decide-reducible).
* `IsWord` / `Word` — the Layeredness predicate and the carrier subtype it cuts out.
* `Word.recursionCount` — the `No-Recursion` violation count, read off the carrier (`noRec`).
* `noRec` / `parseInto` — the violable OT constraints over the carrier (`Constraint Tree`).
* `feet` / `moraCount` / `unfootedCount` — carrier folds extracting feet, morae, stray σ.
* `MinimalWord` / `MaximalWord` / `PerfectWord` — the word-size notions over the carrier.

/-! ### Prosodic OT constraints over the `Tree` carrier

The violable constraints scoring prosodic candidates are `Constraints.Constraint Tree`
values ([prince-smolensky-1993]); a grammar ranks them and scores with the OT engine
(`OptimalityTheory.Tableau.ofRanking`). They are defined on the **carrier** `Tree` (which
holds the ill-formed candidates a well-formed `Word` can't represent). List-recursion auxes
are local `where`s. -/

/-! ### The well-formed prosodic word ω

`isWordTree` is the structural `Bool` realization of the inviolable Layeredness core
([selkirk-1996]); `IsWord` is the declarative predicate it backs, and `Word` the carrier
subtype. Both checkers mirror the `go`/`goList` structural recursion of `noRec`, so they
are `decide`-reducible — a winner can be certified `IsWord by decide`. -/

/-- A well-formed **foot** subtree: an `f`-node dominating a non-empty list of σ-leaves
    ([selkirk-1980]; matches `Foot.toProsTree`). -/
def isFootTree : Tree → Bool
  | .node a cs => decide (a.level = .f) && !cs.isEmpty &&
      cs.all (fun | .node b ds => decide (b.level = .σ) && ds.isEmpty)

/-- The structural Layeredness checker: an ω-node every daughter of which is a well-formed
    foot, a recursive ω (the ω-over-ω arm), or a stray σ-leaf. -/
def isWordTree : Tree → Bool := fun t => go t where
  go : Tree → Bool
    | .node a cs => decide (a.level = .ω) && goList cs
  goList : List Tree → Bool
    | [] => true
    | c :: cs =>
        (isFootTree c || go c || (decide (c.label.level = .σ) && c.children.isEmpty))

/-- A well-formed prosodic word: an ω-node dominating only feet, recursive ω's, and stray σ
    — never φ/ι. This is the inviolable **Layeredness** core. Headedness (a foot daughter —

    footless languages have ω directly over σ (DeLisi 2015, per [dolatian-2020]), and the OT
    recursion candidates abstract the foot level. Exhaustivity (a stray σ) and Nonrecursivity
    (ω-over-ω) are violable OT constraints, so both are admitted here. -/

/-! ### Worked examples -/

-- A bimoraic foot, the perfect word over it, and a recursive (ω-over-ω) word.
private def exFoot : Tree := .node .ft [.node (.syl 2) []]
private def perfectW : Tree := .node .om [exFoot]
private def recursiveW : Tree := .node .om [.node (.syl 1) [], .node .om [exFoot]]

-- Well-formedness: a flat ω over a foot and a recursive ω are both legal words — ω-over-ω
-- is admitted (No-Recursion is violable). A φ-node inside an ω violates Layeredness.
example : IsWord perfectW := by decide
example : IsWord recursiveW := by decide
example : ¬ IsWord (.node .om [.node .ph []] : Tree) := by decide

-- `recursionCount` reads the No-Recursion cost off the carrier: the recursive word scores
-- one ω-over-ω, the flat one zero.
example : Word.recursionCount ⟨recursiveW, by decide⟩ = 1 := by decide
example : Word.recursionCount ⟨perfectW, by decide⟩ = 0 := by decide
