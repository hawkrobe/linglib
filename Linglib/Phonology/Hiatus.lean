# Vowel hiatus

This file defines vowel hiatus, the adjacency of two vowels, and its repair at a morpheme
juncture by eliding one of the vowels or by inserting a consonant between them.

Many languages do not tolerate hiatus. Where a vowel-final morpheme meets a vowel-initial one,
they elide one of the two vowels, turn the first into a glide, merge the two into a third
vowel, syllabify them together as a diphthong, or insert a consonant, and Casali surveys the
variation. Which vowel elides is not free. The first vowel is the usual target, and elision of
the second is well attested only before a function word and at the boundary between a stem and
a suffix, which is the question of Casali's earlier article.

Like `OCP.IsClean`, `Hiatus.Free` is a thin layer over `List.IsChain`, but over two segments
both being vowels, not their being identical, and over adjacency in the string, not on a tier.
So neither constraint is an instance of the other.

## Main definitions

* `Hiatus.Free`, `Hiatus.count`: a form has no two adjacent vowels; the number of adjacent
  vowel pairs.
* `Hiatus.Juncture`: hiatus at a morpheme boundary, where a vowel-final stem meets a
  vowel-initial suffix.
* `Juncture.epenthesize`, `Juncture.elideV1`, `Juncture.elideV2`: the repairs by insertion of
  a consonant and by elision of either vowel.

## Main results

* `Hiatus.free_iff_count_eq_zero`: the ban and the count agree.
* `Juncture.not_free_input`: the unrepaired concatenation has a hiatus.
* `Juncture.free_epenthesize`, `Juncture.free_elideV1`, `Juncture.free_elideV2`: a repaired
  form is free of hiatus exactly when the material on each side of the juncture is.
* `Juncture.elideV1_eq_eraseIdx`, `Juncture.elideV2_eq_eraseIdx`,
  `Juncture.epenthesize_eq_insertIdx`: the repairs as the deletion of one position of the
  unrepaired concatenation and the insertion of one segment into it.
* `Juncture.elideV2_eq_stem_iff`: elision of the second vowel merges the suffixed form with
  the bare stem exactly for a suffix of one segment.

## Implementation notes

Glide formation, coalescence and diphthong formation are not defined, since they turn on the
quality and syllabification of the two vowels and no study yet consumes them.
