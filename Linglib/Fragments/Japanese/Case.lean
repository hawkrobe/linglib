# Japanese case markers

Japanese marks the relations of a noun phrase with particles after it. Tsujimura separates the
case particles, the nominative *ga*, the accusative *o*, the dative *ni* and the genitive *no*,
from the postpositions, the counterparts of English prepositions (`Japanese.Adpositions`): *de*
'at', *e* 'to', *to* 'with', *made* 'until' and *kara* 'from'. The nominative and the
accusative, unlike case endings, may be dropped in casual speech, *Tomodati(-ga) kita?* 'Has my
friend come?', and replaced by *mo* 'also' and *sae* 'even'. Two markers are polysemous: *ni*
marks recipients, goals, times and the location of existence, and *de* the location of an
action and its instrument, so *ni* and *de* share the locative and *ni* and *e* the allative.
*Ga* is recorded as the nominative, setting aside the exhaustive-listing reading of Kuroda and
Kuno; *no* is also a nominalizer, *to* a quotative complementizer and *kara* a reason
conjunction, uses outside case marking. Sadakane and Koizumi's four *ni* lexemes refine the
single *ni* entry, the matter of `Studies/SadakaneKoizumi1995.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `Japanese.Case`, `Japanese.Case.form`: the four cases of the case particles, and the particles.
* `Japanese.Case.label`, `Japanese.Case.functions`: the comparative value each case is named for,
  and the values it expresses.
* `Japanese.Case.droppable`: the cases whose particles casual speech drops.
