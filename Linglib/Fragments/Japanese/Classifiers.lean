# Japanese numeral classifiers

Japanese counts with a classifier suffixed to the numeral and chosen by the semantics of the noun:
*-nin* for people, *-hiki* for small animals, *-hon* for long thin things, *-mai* for flat ones,
*-satsu* for bound volumes. The native *-tsu* has no meaning of its own and serves as the residue
and default classifier for inanimates, and the Sino-Japanese *-ko*, also a residue classifier,
counts smallish concrete inanimates. Downing's questionnaire gives the inventory below, the
classifiers all or most of the respondents used, to which Sudo's *-kumi* 'pair' and *-daasu*
'dozen', which count non-atomic individuals, are added. The two *ken* are told apart by their
characters. Allomorphy (*ippon*, *sanbon*, *roppon*) and the native and Sino-Japanese numeral series
are not recorded.

## Main definitions

* `Japanese.Classifiers.classifiers` — the classifiers entered here

Which nouns each classifier counts is recorded on the nouns (`Japanese.Nouns`).
