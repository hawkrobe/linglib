# Japanese verb suffixes

The suffixes of the Japanese verb and the order in which they appear, from the stem outward:
the verbalizer *-su* (*suru*) of Sino-Japanese verbal nouns, the causative *-(s)ase*, the
passive and the potential in *-(r)are*, the polite *-mas*, the desiderative *-ta(i)*, the
negative *-(a)na* and the inflection that closes the word, non-past *-(r)u*, past *-ta*,
hortative *-(y)oo* or gerund *-te*. A verb form takes at most one suffix of each position, and
the positions appear in this order, so the template is the regular expression of the sublists
of the slot list and a string of suffixes is licensed when its slots match it. The final
position is [narrog-2010b]'s class of inflections: no inflection follows another, so the tense,
mood and nonfinite endings share one slot.

The suffixes and their positions are those [hahn-degen-futrell-2021] extract from the Universal
Dependencies segmentation and document from [kaiser-ichikawa-kobayashi-yamamoto-2013]. The
polite suffix precedes the desiderative there on the strength of corpus forms such as
*mi-mashi-tai* 'I want to see'; the two rarely share a word, since the desiderative inflects as
an adjective and takes the polite copula instead. [narrog-2010b] finds the causative on either
side of the desiderative and counts the potential as modality rather than voice, so the fixed
order is an idealization of the verbal complex, not a description of it.

## Main definitions

* `Japanese.Verb.Slot`, `Japanese.Verb.Exponent`: the suffix positions and the suffixes of each.
* `Japanese.Verb.slots`, `Japanese.Verb.template`: the positions in order and the regular
  expression over them, and `Japanese.Verb.Licensed`, the suffix strings it admits.
* `Japanese.Verb.Exponent.morphs`: the morphs of a suffix, the passive's those of
  `Japanese.directPassive` and the negative's those of `Japanese.Negation.na`.

## Main results

* `Japanese.Verb.licensed_iff`: a string of suffixes is licensed exactly when its slots are a
  sublist of `slots`.

## Implementation notes

The positions are language-internal. Their comparison with a cross-linguistic inventory of
categories is the apparatus of the study that draws it, `Studies/HahnDegenFutrell2021.lean`,
and lives there. The passive and the potential share the slot, and for vowel-stem verbs the
form; the imperative and the conditional endings of the inflection slot are not entered.
