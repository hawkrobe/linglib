# Italian modal verbs

This file records the two core modal verbs of Italian, *potere* 'can, may' and *dovere* 'must,
have to'. Each verb has a fixed force and no fixed flavor. *Potere* expresses an ability or
another circumstantial possibility, a permission, or an epistemic possibility, and *dovere* the
corresponding necessities, with the context of use settling the reading. French *pouvoir* and
*devoir* show the same range.
