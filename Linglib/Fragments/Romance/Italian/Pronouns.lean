# Italian pronouns

Italian has a tonic series of personal pronouns and an atonic series of object pronouns. The
tonic second person distinguishes familiar *tu* and *voi* from polite *Lei*, which agrees as a
third person singular, and the archaic polite plural *Loro*.

The atonic first and second persons have one form each for direct object, indirect object and
reflexive use: *mi*, *ti*, *ci* and *vi*. Only the third person tells the three apart: accusative
*lo*, *la*, *li* and *le*, dative *gli* and *le*, and reflexive *si*, which marks neither gender
nor number. The atonic forms are clitics except the third-person plural dative *loro*, which
Cardinaletti and Starke class as weak: it is deficient, but it follows the verb, never enters a
cluster and bears word stress.

## Main declarations

* `Italian.Pronouns.pronouns` — the tonic series
* `Italian.Pronouns.accusative`, `Italian.Pronouns.dative`, `Italian.Pronouns.reflexive` — the
  atonic series
* `Italian.Pronouns.paradigm_accusative_eq_paradigm_dative_iff`,
  `Italian.Pronouns.paradigm_dative_eq_paradigm_reflexive_iff` — the atonic series are syncretic
  exactly outside the third person
* `Italian.Pronouns.strength_eq_weak_iff` — dative *loro* is the one atonic form that is not a
  clitic

/-- *io* — 1sg. -/
def io : PersonalPronoun :=
  { form := "io", person := some .first, number := some .singular, strength := some .strong }

/-- *tu* — 2sg familiar (T form). -/
def tu : PersonalPronoun :=
  { form := "tu", person := some .second, number := some .singular, honorific := some .nonhonorific,
    strength := some .strong }

/-- *Lei* — polite 2sg (V form). Formally 3rd person: triggers 3sg verbal
    agreement, patterns with 3sg.f clitics, binds 3rd person reflexive *si*.
    Interpretably 2nd person: triggers PCC effects, Fancy Constraint effects,
    2PL resolved agreement in coordination.
