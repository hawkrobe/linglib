# Spanish object clitics

Spanish object pronouns are clitics on the verb. The first and second persons have one form each
for direct object, indirect object and reflexive use: *me*, *te*, *nos* and *os*. Only the third
person tells the three apart: accusative *lo*, *la*, *los* and *las* mark gender and number,
dative *le* and *les* mark number alone, and reflexive *se* marks neither. A third-person dative
is replaced by *se* before a third-person accusative, *se lo doy* and never *le lo doy*, so *se*
is also a form of the dative. *Os* belongs to *vosotros* and is confined to Spain; elsewhere the
third-person plural forms serve for plural addressees. The description follows Butt, Benjamin and
Moreira Rodríguez's reference grammar.

## Main declarations

* `Spanish.Clitics.accusative`, `Spanish.Clitics.dative` — the two object series, personal
  pronouns of the clitic strength class
* `Spanish.Clitics.reflexive` — the reflexive series
* `Spanish.Clitics.paradigm_accusative_eq_paradigm_dative_iff`,
  `Spanish.Clitics.paradigm_dative_eq_paradigm_reflexive_iff` — the series are syncretic exactly
  outside the third person
* `Spanish.Clitics.isSome_gender_iff` — gender is marked by the third-person accusatives alone
