# French modal verbs

This file records the core modal expressions of French. *Pouvoir* 'can, may' is a possibility
modal that expresses an ability or another circumstantial possibility, a permission, or an
epistemic possibility, and *devoir* 'must, have to' expresses the corresponding necessities, with
the context of use settling the reading. *Falloir* 'be necessary' is an impersonal necessity
verb, and *il est possible de* 'it is possible to' an impersonal possibility construction with
an infinitive. In the conditional, *devoir* expresses weak necessity, *tu devrais partir* 'you
should leave' beside *tu dois partir* 'you must leave'. Italian *potere* and *dovere* show the
same range as *pouvoir* and *devoir*.
