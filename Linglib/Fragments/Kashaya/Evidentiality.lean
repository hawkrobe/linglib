# Kashaya evidentiality

Kashaya (Pomoan, northern California) marks the source of the speaker's information with a
paradigm of verbal suffixes, which [oswalt-1986] lays out in his Table 1 and which
[aikhenvald-2004] sets beside the five-choice systems as a complex system with further terms.
The rows of the table are the evidentials, top down in the order of Oswalt's hierarchy of
preference; its columns are the modes of speech. A spontaneous remark, prompted by the event
itself, makes the finest distinctions: the performative pair *-ŵela* ~ *-mela*, the speaker
performing or having just performed the act, so that the subject is first person; the
factual-visual pair *-ŵă* ~ *-yă*, the speaker seeing or having seen it, the imperfective
factual also stating general truths and common knowledge; the auditory *-V̂nnă*, the sound of
the action heard but not seen; inferential I *-qă*, inference from evidence found apart from the
event; and the quotative *-do*, information learned from someone else. The performative and the
factual-visual are complementary pairs selected by the aspect of the stem, the imperfective
member for imperfective stems and the perfective for perfective ones, an aspectless stem taking
either. A response to another's words adds the suffix *-m* and drops the performative, the
factual-visual pair taking its place. The narrative construction, with the evidential on the
assertive enclitic and the main verb in the absolutive, collapses all direct evidence to the
personal experience *-yowă* against the quotative, and the archaic remote past *-miyă* marks
personal experience in an irretrievable past. Inferential II *-bi-* is never verb-final: it
precedes a subordinating suffix, the absolutive or another evidential, so it stands outside the
mutually exclusive paradigm. WALS codes the language as having direct and indirect evidentials
(`Data/WALS/Features/F77A.lean`).

## Implementation notes

The forms are Oswalt's morphophonemic suffixes in Aikhenvald's typography, *ŵ* an initial that
surfaces only after a vowel, *V̂* a vowel determined by the preceding consonant and *ă* a final
vowel that is zero before a word boundary. The performative covers none of Aikhenvald's six
parameters: its source, the speaker's own act, lies outside them. The general truths the
factual states are general knowledge cast in the visual, an extension of its coverage rather
than a parameter of its own. The six parameters cannot split hearing from the other senses, so
the auditory carries the whole non-visual sensory parameter although Oswalt notes that smell
and touch fall by default to inferential I.
