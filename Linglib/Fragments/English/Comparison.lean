# English comparison

English compares with a particle marking the standard, *X is taller than Y*, *X is more
careful than Y*: the standard follows *than*, whose case is derived from the comparee's, and the
degree is marked on the adjective, by the suffix *-er* or the free word *more*. The
superlative is morphological, *-est*. Stassen classes the construction as a particle
comparative.

## Main definitions

* `English.Comparison.than`: the *than*-comparative.
* `English.Comparison.superlative`: the superlative strategy.
