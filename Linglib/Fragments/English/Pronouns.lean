# English pronouns

This file defines the English personal, reflexive, reciprocal, interrogative and demonstrative
pronouns.

The personal pronouns distinguish a nominative from an accusative form, except *you* and *it*,
and distinguish gender in the third person singular only. *You* serves one addressee or several,
and *we* makes no clusivity distinction. *They* and *them* serve a single referent as well as
several; singular *they* bears no gender feature, where *he*, *she* and *it* each bear one. Every
personal pronoun has a reflexive in *-self* or *-selves*, singular *they* having *themself*
beside *themselves*. The reciprocals *each other* and *one another* are two-part noun phrases
rather than dedicated pronouns. The interrogatives ask about a person, a thing, a place, a time
or a manner. The demonstratives contrast a proximal with a distal form in each number.

## Main definitions

* `English.Pronouns.pronouns` — the personal pronoun inventory
* `English.Pronouns.paradigm` — its forms for each referential category
* `English.Pronouns.reflexives`, `English.Pronouns.reciprocals`,
  `English.Pronouns.interrogatives`, `English.Pronouns.demonstratives` — the other series

## Main results

* `English.Pronouns.third_singular_of_gender` — gender is marked in the third person singular only
* `English.Pronouns.paradigm_addressee`, `English.Pronouns.paradigm_speakerAddressee`,
  `English.Pronouns.paradigm_others_subset` — the forms do not distinguish the number of
  addressees or clusivity, and the plural third person forms also serve a single referent
* `English.Pronouns.exists_reflexive` — every personal pronoun has a reflexive with its person,
  number and gender
