# English nouns

The English noun as a lexical entry is a `ClassifiedNoun` over no classifiers, which a numeral
counts directly or not at all, with its lexical gender and its plural where it has them; a regular
plural is the *-s* form of `Inflection.lean`'s `suffixS`. Names are the root `ProperName`. English
nouns have no grammatical gender; the label recorded for *man*, *woman* and the names is the natural
gender their pronouns agree with. Bare plurals and bare mass nouns are arguments and a bare singular
count noun is not, which Chierchia derives from the Nominal Mapping Parameter
(`Studies/Chierchia1998.lean`).

## Main definitions

* `numberSystem`: the singular and the plural.
* `Noun`: the entry, with `Noun.realize` giving its form at a number.
* `Noun.toWordSg`, `Noun.toWord`: the entry as a `Word` token.

## Implementation notes

Whether a numeral counts a noun and whether the noun has a plural are separate fields, since
*oats* has a plural and no numeral counts it. A noun with a plural and no singular, such as
*oats*, is not yet recorded: `Noun.realize` gives every entry its citation form as the singular.
