# English determiners

The quantificational determiners of English are the carrier `QuantityWord`. A word projects to a
`Quantifier` record by `QuantityWord.toQuantifier`, which carries only what the readings leave
open, the number the word selects and whether it selects mass nouns. The readings themselves are
the `Denotes` instance, a set of `Quantifier.GQ.Family` per word: a word with one consensus
reading denotes a singleton, so `⟦QuantityWord.all⟧` is `{every}`, and *many*, whose standard
Barwise and Cooper leave to context, denotes `∅`. Everything a reading fixes, its force,
monotonicity, strength and conservativity, is a theorem about it, as in
`Studies/BarwiseCooper1981.lean`. The articles, demonstratives and possessives are the other
determiner kinds.

## Main declarations

* `QuantityWord`: the quantificational determiners, with the six-word scale
  `QuantityWord.scale` of van Tiel, Franke and Sauerland inside it.
* `QuantityWord.toQuantifier`: a word as a determiner record.
* `inventory`: the English determiner inventory, and `marking` derives its cell in Moroney's
  typology of definite marking.

/-- The quantificational determiners of English are the six-word quantity scale *none*, *few*,
*some*, *half*, *most* and *all*, and *every*, *each*, *many*, *both* and *neither*. -/

/-- The form of a word is its spelling. -/
def form : QuantityWord → String

  | .few => "few"
  | .some_ => "some"

  | .all => "all"
  | .every => "every"
  | .each => "each"
  | .many => "many"
  | .both => "both"
  | .neither => "neither"

/-- The grammatical number a word selects is left open by the denotation, so *every* and *all*
share a denotation and differ here. *Both* and *neither* select the dual, the core concept
`[−atomic, +minimal]` of [harbour-2014], whose cardinality clause the denotation reflects
([jeretic-bassi-gonzalez-yatsushiro-meyer-sauerland-2025]). -/

leaves open. -/

quantifiers on every finite domain. *None* reads as `no`, *some* as `Quantifier.GQ.some`, *all*,
*every* and *each* as `every`, *most* as `most`, *few* as `few`, *half* as `half`, *both* as
`both` and *neither* as `neither`; *many* has no reading, since [barwise-cooper-1981] leave its
standard to context. -/

/-! ## Articles, demonstratives and possessives

The articles and demonstratives are not quantifiers, since what they denote is definiteness and
not a generalized quantifier. -/

/-- *The* is the definite article, syncretic over both strengths of [schwarz-2009]. -/
def the : Article :=
  { form := "the", definiteness := .definite, exponent := .dedicatedMorpheme
  , uses := {.immediateSituation, .largerSituation, .anaphoric, .donkey} }

/-- *A* is the singular indefinite article. -/
def a : Article :=
  { form := "a", definiteness := .indefinite, exponent := .dedicatedMorpheme }

/-- *An* is the singular indefinite article, the allomorph of *a* before a vowel. -/
def an : Article :=
  { form := "an", definiteness := .indefinite, exponent := .dedicatedMorpheme }

/-- *This* is the singular proximal demonstrative. -/
def this : DemonstrativeDeterminer := { form := "this", deixis := Person.first.participantSets }

/-- *That* is the singular distal demonstrative. -/
def that : DemonstrativeDeterminer := { form := "that", deixis := Person.first.participantSetsᶜ }

/-- *These* is the plural proximal demonstrative. -/
def these : DemonstrativeDeterminer := { form := "these", deixis := Person.first.participantSets }

/-- *Those* is the plural distal demonstrative. -/
def those : DemonstrativeDeterminer := { form := "those", deixis := Person.first.participantSetsᶜ }

/-- *My* is the first-person possessive determiner. -/
def my : PossessiveDeterminer := { form := "my" }

/-- *Your* is the second-person possessive determiner. -/
def your : PossessiveDeterminer := { form := "your" }

/-! ## The inventory -/

/-- The quantificational determiners as records. -/

/-- The articles. -/
def allArticles : List Article := [the, a, an]

/-- The demonstratives. -/
def allDemonstratives : List DemonstrativeDeterminer := [this, that, these, those]

/-- The possessive determiners. -/
def allPossessives : List PossessiveDeterminer := [my, your]

/-- The determiner inventory collects every kind of determiner. -/
def inventory : Determiner.Inventory :=
  allArticles.map .article ++ allDemonstratives.map .demonstrative ++
    allQuantifiers.map .quantifier ++ allPossessives.map .possessive

/-- English's inventory is in the `.generallyMarked` cell of [moroney-2021], since the
syncretic *the* covers both use types of [schwarz-2009]. -/
