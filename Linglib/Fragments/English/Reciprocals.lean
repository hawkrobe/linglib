# English reciprocals

English marks reciprocity with the two-part noun phrases *each other* and *one another*, which fill
an argument slot of a bivalent clause and are distinct from the reflexive *themselves*. A closed
class of predicates such as *meet*, *quarrel* and *kiss* is reciprocal without any marker. The
markers are those of the pronoun entries in `Fragments/English/Pronouns.lean`. The lexical strategy
has no exponent, so the verb entries carry it rather than the marker inventory.
