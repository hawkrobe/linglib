# English tense forms

This file describes the tense forms of English, following Huddleston's chapter on the verb in
the Cambridge grammar. English marks one tense contrast by inflection, the present *takes*
against the preterite *took*, and the rest by auxiliaries. The perfect, a secondary past tense,
puts the past participle under *have*, as in *has taken*, and the progressive aspect puts the
gerund-participle under *be*, as in *is taking*. The auxiliaries come in a fixed order, the
perfect before the progressive, so that *has been taking* is a form and *is having taken* is
not, and neither auxiliary combines with itself. The eight tense forms are therefore the
present and the preterite of the simple, progressive, perfect and perfect progressive
constructions. The grammar treats *will* as a modal auxiliary, a marker of mood, so *will take*
is not among the tense forms.

## Main declarations

* `English.TenseVerb`: a lexical verb or one of the tense auxiliaries *have* and *be*.
* `English.periphrasis`, `English.Verb.tenseForm`: the means by which English builds its tense
  forms, and the words of a tense form of a verb, finite verb first.
* `English.tenseForms`: the eight tense forms; `Verb.tenseForm_isSome_iff` shows that they are
  exactly the forms that English realizes.

## Implementation notes

`Verb.tenseForm` gives the third person singular. The fixed order of the auxiliaries is not
stipulated on forms: it follows from which auxiliary may govern which verb, *have* governing a
lexical verb or *be*, and *be* governing a lexical verb only.
