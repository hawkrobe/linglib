# English copular predicates

This file defines the English predicates of the form *be* + adjective that embed a clause: the
emotive factive *annoyed (that p)* and the veridical non-factive *right (that p)*, which entails
its complement without presupposing it, both from Degen and Tonhauser's projection experiments,
and *able (to VP)*, which Karttunen lists among the positive verbs that are implicative by
default but admit the weaker presupposition of a necessary condition only, so that its negation
entails the negation of the complement while its affirmative need not entail the complement.
The adjectives are `ClauseEmbeddingAdjective` entries, and the copular verbs are their
realization with *be*.

/-- *annoyed (that p)*, an emotive factive adjective, a hole for the presuppositions of its
complement as every factive is ([karttunen-1973]). -/
def annoyed : ClauseEmbeddingAdjective where
  form := "annoyed"
  factivity := some .full
  projectionBehavior := some .hole

/-- *right (that p)*, a veridical non-factive adjective, which entails its complement without
presupposing it. -/
def right : ClauseEmbeddingAdjective where
  form := "right"

/-- *able (to VP)*, a subject-control adjective among the positive verbs of [karttunen-1971]
that are implicative by default but admit the weaker presupposition of a necessary condition
only: *John wasn't able to come* entails that he did not come, while *John was able to come*
need not entail that he came. It is a hole, as Karttunen's other one- and two-way implicatives
are ([karttunen-1973]), and the counterpart of the one-way Finnish *pystyä*
([nadathur-2023-implicatives]). The entailment of the affirmative on its actualized reading is the
actuality entailment of ability, which [nadathur-2023] derives from aspect rather than from the
lexicon: *able* presupposes an action causally necessary and sufficient for the complement and
asserts only the subject's capacity for it, a stative that perfective aspect coerces into an
instance of the action (Proposal (7.10), §7.2). -/
