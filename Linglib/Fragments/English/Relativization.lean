# English relative clauses

English has two relative-clause strategies, both postnominal. The complementizer *that*, or
nothing at all, introduces a clause in which the relativized position is left empty, and it
relativizes subjects and direct objects. The relative pronouns *who*, *whom*, *which* and
*whose* code the relativized position by their form or by a pied-piped preposition, and they
relativize everything from indirect objects down to objects of comparison, though the paper
finds *the man who Mary is taller than* "rather uncomfortable". The data are
[keenan-comrie-1977]'s.
