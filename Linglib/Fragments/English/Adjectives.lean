# English adjectives

This file lists the English adjective lexemes. An entry records the surface
form, the scalar dimension, the polarity, the antonym and the comparison
paradigm: the comparative and superlative forms with their root pattern,
`Paradigm.abb` for *good – better – best*. An antonym pair is entered once,
as an `AntonymPair` on its shared scale, and its two polar adjectives are the
pair's `pos` and `neg`.

def volume : AntonymPair :=
  { dimension := .volume, posForm := "loud", negForm := "quiet" }

abbrev loud := volume.pos

/-! ## Intelligence and confidence

The confidence adjectives are the gradable attitude adjectives of
[cariani-santorio-wellwood-2024]. They measure on an upper-bounded confidence
scale, with *certain* at its maximum and *doubtful*, *unsure* and *uncertain*
on its negative pole. -/

def smart : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "smart", dimension := some .intelligence, comparison := .synthetic "smarter" "smartest"
  , antonymForm := some "dumb" }

/-- *Confident* is relative on the upper-closed confidence scale. [cariani-santorio-wellwood-2024]
give it the ordering of *certain* with a contextual contrast state below *certain*'s maximal
states ((40), Figure 3), so that *confident but not certain* (65a) is consistent while
*completely confident* (69a) reaches the maximum. [goodman-2024]'s non-extremity makes its
threshold non-maximal in many ordinary contexts, on the evidence of *confident that p, and even
more confident that p or q* (3). Interpretive Economy ([kennedy-2007] (66)) would give it the
maximum of the scale, so the standard is lexical. -/
def confident : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "confident", dimension := some .confidence, lexicalStandard := some .contextual
  , comparison := .periphrastic "more confident" "most confident" }

/-- *certain* and *uncertain* measure on an upper-closed scale, *certain* with the maximum standard
and *uncertain* with the minimum, as *perfectly certain* and *slightly uncertain* show
([kennedy-2007] (64)), so the pair is contradictory. -/
def confidence : AntonymPair :=
  { dimension := .confidence, posForm := "certain", negForm := "uncertain"
  , posComparison := .periphrastic "more certain" "most certain"
  , negComparison := .periphrastic "more uncertain" "most uncertain" }

abbrev certain := confidence.pos

abbrev uncertain := confidence.neg

/-- *sure* and *unsure* are entered on the scale of *certain* and *uncertain*. -/
def sureness : AntonymPair :=
  { dimension := .confidence, posForm := "sure", negForm := "unsure"
  , posComparison := .synthetic "surer" "surest"
  , negComparison := .periphrastic "more unsure" "most unsure" }

abbrev sure := sureness.pos

abbrev unsure := sureness.neg

def doubtful : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "doubtful", polarity := .negative, dimension := some .confidence
  , comparison := .periphrastic "more doubtful" "most doubtful" }

/-! ## Evaluative adjectives -/

/-- "good" — open value scale, contrary to "bad". "good" takes a contextual
    standard and patterns with relative adjectives ([beltrama-2025] §3); on the
    open `.value` scale this class is *derived* (open ⇒ contextual) rather than
    stipulated, so no `lexicalStandard` is needed. -/
def value : AntonymPair :=
  { dimension := .value, posForm := "good", negForm := "bad"
  , posComparison := .suppletive "better" "best", negComparison := .suppletive "worse" "worst"
  , evaluativeValence := some .positive }

abbrev good := value.pos

abbrev bad := value.neg

def beauty : AntonymPair :=
  { dimension := .beauty, posForm := "beautiful", negForm := "ugly"
  , evaluativeValence := some .positive }

abbrev beautiful := beauty.pos

abbrev ugly := beauty.neg

def important : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "important", dimension := some .importance }

/-- *safe* and *dangerous* measure on an upper-closed scale, so *completely safe* is fine but
*??completely dangerous* is not ([kennedy-mcnally-2005] (27c)), and the pair is weak and
contradictory, as Gotzner and Mazzarella's entailment pretest assumes ([gotzner-mazzarella-2024],
Appendix 1). Alexandropoulou and Gotzner instead use it as a strong pair in their materials
([alexandropoulou-gotzner-2024a], Table A.2), which would make it contrary. -/
def safety : AntonymPair :=
  { dimension := .safety, posForm := "safe", negForm := "dangerous"
  , evaluativeValence := some .positive }

abbrev safe := safety.pos

abbrev dangerous := safety.neg

/-! ## Physical disturbance deverbal adjectives

[tham-2025]: physical disturbance predicates are associated with a totally
closed, multi-point scale. Lower bound = physical instantiation of disturbance;
upper bound = spatial extent of host entity. Gradable (*more cracked*, *badly
dented*), compatible with *completely* and *partially*. Contra
[rappaport-hovav-2014] (two-point) and [rotstein-winter-2004]
(lower-bounded only). -/

/-- "cracked" — closed scale, contradictory to "uncracked".
    Deverbal adjective from *crack* (Levin 45.1 Break verbs).
    NOT a two-point scale: accepts *more cracked*, *completely cracked*,
    *partially cracked*, *badly cracked* ([tham-2025] §2.3–2.4). -/
def cracked : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "cracked", dimension := some .cracking, lexicalStandard := some .minEndpoint }

/-- "dented" — closed scale.
    Deverbal adjective from *dent*. Accepts *more dented*, *completely dented*,
    *badly dented* ([tham-2025] (11a), (20b)). -/
def dented : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "dented", dimension := some .denting, lexicalStandard := some .minEndpoint }

/-- "scratched" — closed scale.
    Deverbal adjective from *scratch*. Accepts *more scratched*, *completely
    scratched*, *badly scratched* ([tham-2025] (11b), (20c)). -/
def scratched : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "scratched", dimension := some .scratching, lexicalStandard := some .minEndpoint }

/-- "shattered" — closed scale, NON-GRADABLE.
    Deverbal adjective from *shatter* (Levin 45.1 Break verbs).
    Contrast: ??*more shattered*, punctual verb, no durative reading.
    Not a physical disturbance predicate ([tham-2025] (12c)). -/
def shattered : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "shattered" }

/-! ## Mildly positive adjectives (MPAs)

[beltrama-2025]: MPAs encode a necessity standard — the minimum value
required for pursuit. They share properties with both relative (context-sensitive,
gradable) and absolute (no zone of indifference, crisp judgments, *barely*
compatible) predicates. -/

/-- "nice" — open scale, positive evaluative ([nouwen-2024]).
    Base for M-degree intensifier *nicely*. -/
def nice : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "nice", dimension := some .value, evaluativeValence := some .positive }

/-- "pleasant" — open scale, positive evaluative ([nouwen-2024]).
    Base for M-degree intensifier *pleasantly*. -/
def pleasantness : AntonymPair :=
  { dimension := .value, posForm := "pleasant", negForm := "unpleasant"
  , evaluativeValence := some .positive }

abbrev pleasant := pleasantness.pos

abbrev unpleasant := pleasantness.neg

/-- *decent* is a mildly positive adjective, on the open value scale with a functional
    (necessity) standard ([beltrama-2025]) recorded as its `lexicalStandard`. -/
def decent : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "decent", dimension := some .value, evaluativeValence := some .positive
  , lexicalStandard := some .necessity }

/-- "acceptable" — mildly-positive adjective; open `.value` scale, functional
    standard ([beltrama-2025]). Deverbal *-able* form: the modal suffix
    contributes the functional standard. -/
def acceptable : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "acceptable", dimension := some .value, evaluativeValence := some .positive
  , lexicalStandard := some .necessity }

/-- "adequate" — mildly-positive adjective; open `.value` scale, functional
    (necessity) standard ([beltrama-2025]). -/
def adequate : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "adequate", dimension := some .value, evaluativeValence := some .positive
  , lexicalStandard := some .necessity }

/-! ## Deadjectival intensifier bases ([nouwen-2024])

Adjectival bases for deadjectival intensifiers. Evaluative adjectives
(horrible, wonderful) derive H-degree or M-degree intensifiers via the
Goldilocks effect. Mirative (unusual, surprising) and modal (possible,
impossible) bases follow Zwicky's generalization. -/

/-! ### Negative-evaluative bases: H-degree intensifiers -/

def dreadful : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "dreadful", dimension := some .quality, evaluativeValence := some .negative }

/-- "frightening" — open scale, negative evaluative. Base for H-degree *frighteningly*. -/
def frightening : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "frightening", dimension := some .danger, evaluativeValence := some .negative }

/-- "disgusting" — open scale, negative evaluative. Base for H-degree *disgustingly*. -/

/-- "gorgeous" — open scale, positive evaluative. Base for M-degree *gorgeously*. -/
def gorgeous : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "gorgeous", dimension := some .beauty, evaluativeValence := some .positive }

/-! ### Mirative bases: H-degree intensifiers, not evaluative -/

def expectation : AntonymPair :=
  { dimension := .expectation, posForm := "usual", negForm := "unusual"
  , evaluativeValence := some .neutral }

abbrev usual := expectation.pos

abbrev unusual := expectation.neg

/-- "surprising" — open scale, neutral (mirative). Base for H-degree *surprisingly*. -/
def surprising : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "surprising", dimension := some .expectation, evaluativeValence := some .neutral }

/-- "remarkable" — open scale, positive evaluative (§2.4.1). Extreme positive
    evaluation: H-degree *remarkably* despite positive valence (Goldilocks exception). -/
def remarkable : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "remarkable", dimension := some .quality, evaluativeValence := some .positive }

/-- "stunning" — open scale, positive evaluative (Figure 2, upper-right quadrant).
    Extreme positive evaluation: H-degree *stunningly* (Goldilocks exception). -/
def stunning : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "stunning", dimension := some .quality, evaluativeValence := some .positive }

/-! ### Modal bases: Zwicky's generalization -/

/-- "expected" — open scale, neutral (modal). Unattested as intensifier (*expectedly). -/
def expected : GradableAdjective :=
  { form := "expected", dimension := some .expectation, evaluativeValence := some .neutral }

/-- *possible* and *impossible* are contradictories, since *possible* takes the minimum standard of
the lower-closed possibility scale and *impossible* the maximum of its dual, as *wet* and *dry* do.
Whether *possible* is gradable at all is disputed ([lassiter-2017] §5.2.2); the entry records its
gradable use, which *impossibly long* needs ([nouwen-2024] (27b)). -/
def possibility : AntonymPair :=
  { dimension := .possibility, posForm := "possible"
  , negForm := "impossible", evaluativeValence := some .neutral }

abbrev possible := possibility.pos

abbrev impossible := possibility.neg

  smoothness, hardness, life, size, extremeSize, pristineness, warmth, weight, thickness, depth,
