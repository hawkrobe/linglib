# English adverbs

The closed-class adverbs of English are typed by their semantic owners. The modal adverbs
*certainly*, *definitely*, *necessarily*, *possibly*, *perhaps*, *maybe*, *probably* and
*potentially* are `Modality.ModalItem`s, with their force–flavor meanings and register. The
adverbs of quantification *always*, *usually*, *sometimes* and *never*, which Lewis analyzes as
quantifiers over cases, are the carrier `AdverbOfQuantification`, whose words denote their
readings as generalized quantifiers. The modal-concord readings of *must certainly* and *may
possibly* and the situation-pronoun analysis of adverbs of quantification live in the studies
that treat them.
