# English verb second

This file records where the finite verb of Standard English and of Belfast English moves to the
left periphery, as a distribution over sentence types and embedding contexts. Standard English
moves the verb, an auxiliary, only in matrix wh-questions and yes/no-questions, the
subject–auxiliary inversion; declaratives, exclamatives, imperatives and embedded clauses are
not verb second. Belfast English adds imperatives, *Bring you that with you!*, and embedded
root-like yes/no-questions, *They asked me was I going to the party*, the examples Henry
reports; Westergaard notes that the imperative movement may target a lower head.
