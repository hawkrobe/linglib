# Georgian case marking and verbal agreement

The Georgian verb agrees with its subject and its objects by means of two sets of affixes. Set A
has *v-* for the first person, nothing for the second and a suffix for the third, and adds *-t*
for a first or second person plural. Set B has *m-* for the first person singular, *gv-* for
the first person plural and *g-* for the second person, with *-t* for its plural. A third person
direct object has no Set B affix, while a third person indirect object has *h-* or *s-* before
certain consonants.

Which set marks which argument, and in which case the arguments stand, depends on the class of
the verb and on the series of its tense. The tenses fall into three series: the first contains
the present and the future, the second the aorist, the third the perfect. Transitive verbs, and
the medial verbs that pattern with them, such as *tamaš* 'play', have three patterns. In the
first series the subject is nominative with Set A and the direct object dative with Set B. In
the second the subject is ergative and the direct object nominative, with the same sets. In the
third the subject is dative with Set B and the direct object nominative with Set A, and an
indirect object loses its agreement and becomes the object of the postposition *-tvis* 'for'.
Intransitive verbs have the first of these patterns in every series, and indirect verbs, such
as *c'on* 'like', have the third in every series.

## Main declarations

* `Georgian.setA`, `Georgian.setB`: the two sets of agreement affixes.
* `Georgian.Series`, `Georgian.VerbClass`: the series of the tenses and the classes of verbs.
* `Georgian.Pattern`: the case and the agreement set of the subject and the objects, with the
  three patterns `Pattern.nominative`, `Pattern.ergative` and `Pattern.inverse`.
* `Georgian.pattern`: the pattern of each class in each series.

## Main results

* `Georgian.hasObjectPrefix_iff_isSAP`: the direct objects with a Set B prefix are the first and
  second persons.
* `Georgian.subject_affixes_present_eq_aorist`: the subject keeps its set of affixes from the
  first series to the second, whatever becomes of its case.
* `Georgian.subject_case_ne_iff`: the subject changes case from the first series to the second
  exactly in the transitive and medial classes.

## Implementation notes

The third person suffixes of Set A are those of the present; other tenses have *-a* or *-o* in
the singular and *-es* or *-nen* in the plural. The classes are the four of Harris, who numbers
them 1 (transitive), 2 (intransitive), 3 (medial) and 4 (indirect); Hewitt adds a small class of
stative verbs, which pattern with the intransitives.
