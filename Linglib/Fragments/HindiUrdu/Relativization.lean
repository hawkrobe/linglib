# Hindi-Urdu relative clauses

Hindi-Urdu relativizes with the relative pronoun *jo*, oblique *jis-*, which carries the same
postpositions as an ordinary noun phrase and so codes the relativized position. It occurs in two
constructions, a postnominal clause and the correlative *jo … vo*, in which the head noun
stands inside the relative clause and is picked up by *vo* in the main clause; the paper codes
the correlative as an internally headed strategy. Both relativize subjects through genitives,
and objects of comparison are treated as obliques governed by postpositions. The data are
[keenan-comrie-1977]'s.
