# Hindi-Urdu case

Hindi-Urdu nominals carry three layers of case-like marking (Masica §8.4, pp. 231–233). The
first is inflection: a noun has a direct, an oblique and a vocative form in each number, and a
declined adjective agrees with it in the direct–oblique contrast (Spencer (1)–(2); Mohanan p. 62).
The second is the simple postpositions of `HindiUrdu.Adpositions`, which follow the oblique form
and have one shape in both numbers (Masica p. 233; Mohanan pp. 60–63). The third is the complex
postpositions, which follow a genitive, as *bacce-ke liye* 'for the child'.

Which of these are the cases is disputed. Masica treats the postpositions as formal cases under
the traditional labels, and finds no accusative among them (pp. 238–239); Mohanan takes them to
mark universal case features, *ko* both the accusative of objects and the dative of goals
(p. 67); Spencer takes the three inflected forms to be the only cases, the postpositions being
words that select the oblique. This file records the inflected forms, on which the three agree,
as `HindiUrdu.Case`.

The alignment is split by aspect, as Blake describes it: in the perfective the transitive subject
takes *ne* and the object the direct form, while elsewhere the subject is direct and the object
takes *ko* when it is marked at all.

## Main definitions

* `HindiUrdu.Case`, `HindiUrdu.Case.label`: the direct, oblique and vocative forms, and the
  comparative value each is named for.
* `HindiUrdu.Noun`, `HindiUrdu.nouns`: Spencer's two nouns with a vocative, by the form of each
  case in each number.
* `HindiUrdu.alignment`: the alignment of case marking by aspect.

## Main results

* `HindiUrdu.plural_larkaa_injective`: the plural of *laRkaa* 'boy' keeps the three cases apart,
  the vocative *laRko* against the oblique *laRkõ*.
* `HindiUrdu.singular_oblique_eq_vocative`: the singular has one form for the oblique and the
  vocative.

## Implementation notes

Hindi and Urdu are literary styles of one colloquial language, with virtually identical grammar
and core vocabulary (Masica §2.3, p. 27). The sources describe the case system from Hindi data,
and the fragment records it for both.

The forms are [spencer-2005]'s transcription, `R` a retroflex rhotic, doubled vowels long and a
tilde marking nasalization. His table gives the inanimates *makaan* 'house' and *mez* 'table' no
vocative, and they are left out.
