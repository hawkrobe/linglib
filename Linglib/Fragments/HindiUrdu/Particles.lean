# Hindi-Urdu interrogative particles

Hindi-Urdu has no polar *wh*-complementizer (English *whether*, Italian
*se*): finite complements of every clause type are introduced by the
general subordinator *ki* (compare Hungarian *hogy*), and matrix polar
questions are marked by rising intonation plus the optional particle
*kya:*. *kya:* occurs in polar and alternative but not constituent
questions and occupies a projection above CP (Bhatt and Dayal's ForceP,
Dayal's later PerspP); it embeds only in quasi-subordination. Since
nothing clause-types a bare embedded polar clause, subordinated polar
questions require the overt alternative *ya: nahii:* "or not". This file
provides the three particles as `Particle` values with recorded
licensing distributions.

## Main declarations

* `HindiUrdu.Particles.kya` — the polar question particle.
* `HindiUrdu.Particles.ki` — the general subordinator.
* `HindiUrdu.Particles.ya_nahi` — the overt polar alternative.
