# Nez Perce modals

The modal vocabulary of Nez Perce (Sahaptian, ISO 639-3 `nez`) as [deal-2011] §2 surveys it,
divided into epistemic and nonepistemic expressions. The nonepistemic ones are the productive
verbal suffix *o'qa*, with deontic, pure circumstantial and counterfactual readings; the
participial construction in *-(n/t)e's* with a copula, expressing a circumstantial possibility
akin to English *-able* and teleological modality; and the unproductive suffix *'ax̂*, which the
speakers who have it judge equivalent to *o'qa*. The epistemic ones are particles, *o'qa* never
being epistemic.

## Implementation notes

* Counterfactual and teleological readings count as circumstantial, the library's flavours
  drawing no finer line.
* Of the epistemic particles only *pay's* and *páalwit* 'maybe' are entered. *'éete* 'surely,
  I guess', glossed as inferential, co-occurs with *pay's* for 'maybe', and *ku'(nu) weet*
  'dunno whether' is an ignorance marker with the yes/no particle; neither has a settled force.

/-! ### Nonepistemic modals -/

/-- The suffix *o'qa* (allomorphs *yo'qa*, *no'qa*), a possibility modal read deontically, pure
circumstantially and counterfactually, never epistemically or teleologically ([deal-2011]
§2.2–2.6). -/
def oqa : ModalItem := { form := "o'qa", meaning := {pd, pc} }

/-- The participial construction, the deverbalizing suffix *-(n/t)e's* with a copula: a
circumstantial possibility akin to English *-able*, and teleological modality, never deontic or
counterfactual ([deal-2011] §2.6). -/
def participialEs : ModalItem := { form := "-(n/t)e's", meaning := {pc} }

/-- The suffix *'ax̂*, no longer productive, which the speakers who have it judge essentially
equivalent to *o'qa* in meaning ([deal-2011] §2.6). -/
def ax : ModalItem := { form := "'ax̂", meaning := oqa.meaning }

/-! ### Epistemic particles -/

/-- The particle *pay's* 'maybe' ([deal-2011] §2.5). -/
def pays : ModalItem := { form := "pay's", meaning := {pe} }

/-- The particle *páalwit* 'maybe, perhaps' ([deal-2011] §2.5). -/
def paalwit : ModalItem := { form := "páalwit", meaning := {pe} }

/-- The modals [deal-2011] §2 surveys. -/
