# Hebrew relative clauses

Modern Hebrew forms its postnominal relative clauses with the complementizer *she-*, in two
ways. With the relativized position left empty, *she-* relativizes subjects and direct objects.
With a personal pronoun in the relativized position, the strategy Keenan and Comrie take as the
characteristic Semitic one, it relativizes everything from direct objects down to objects of
comparison: *ha-isha she-David natan la et ha-sefer* 'the woman that David gave the book to',
with the pronoun in *la* 'to her'. The direct object is shared between the two, subjects do not
retain a pronoun, and relative clauses on objects of comparison are only marginally
acceptable. The data are Keenan and Comrie's; Sichel's distinction between the optional
resumptive of direct objects, a bound pronoun, and the obligatory resumptive of prepositional
objects, a movement copy, is the matter of the studies of resumption.
