# Tangale tense–aspect morphology

The six tense–aspect categories of Tangale (Kaltungo dialect) and
their exponence, from [kidda-1985]'s summary diagram: the perfective
and imperative are verb-final suffixes; the four imperfective
non-imperatives share the suffix *-é* and are distinguished by a
preposed particle (*wa* future, *né* continuous), the subject clitic
*-n* (habitual), or nothing (subjunctive). Suffix alternants are
conditioned by voicing of the preceding segment and tense–lax vowel
harmony (§1.19–1.20).

The `subjectVE` field records the (23)–(24) generalization: the
subject's final vowel elides unless *wa*, *né*, or *-n* intervenes —
the morphological ground for the focus-marking asymmetry between
perfective and progressive clauses in [hartmann-zimmermann-2004].
[jungraithmayr-1991] is the lexical companion source.
