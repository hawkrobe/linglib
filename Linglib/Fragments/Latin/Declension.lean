# Latin noun declension

Latin nouns inflect for six cases and two numbers, and the endings fuse case and number, and in
the first two declensions gender as well. Five declensions are traditionally recognised, named
for historical stem classes that are no longer transparent: ā-stems, o-stems, the third
declension with its consonant stems and i-stems, u-stems and ē-stems. The paradigms here are
the seven of Blake's table of Latin case paradigms.

No paradigm distinguishes all six cases. Two syncretisms predominate: nominative and accusative
fall together in every neuter and in many plurals, and dative and ablative fall together in
every plural, in the singular of the second declension and in the singular of the i-stems. The
vocative differs from the nominative only in the singular of non-neuter second-declension
nouns.

## Main declarations

* `Latin.Declension.forms`: the forms of the six cases, in the order of the school paradigms.
* `Latin.Declension.Noun`: a noun with its declension, genders and the form of each case in each
  number.
* `separatesPoints_paradigms`, `not_injective`: the paradigms of the table separate the six
  cases, though no one of them does.
* `nom_acc_syncretic_of_neuter`, `plural_dat_abl_syncretic`, `singular_dat_abl_syncretic_iff`,
  `singular_nom_voc_syncretic_iff`: the syncretisms, read off the forms.

## Implementation notes

Blake's table gives two forms for the ablative singular and the accusative plural of *cīvis*.
`Noun.singular` and `Noun.plural` hold the first, the i-stem form, and `civis.variant` the second.
The genders of the four nouns whose columns the table leaves unlabelled are the dictionary ones.
