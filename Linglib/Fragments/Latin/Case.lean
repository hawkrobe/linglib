# Latin case

The traditional description of Latin has six cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive,
dative and ablative. The vocative is a form of address standing outside the clause, and it is
distinct from the nominative only in the singular of non-neuter second-declension nouns
(`Latin.Declension`).

The ablative continues three cases that were once distinct, an ablative, a locative and an
instrumental, and it expresses source, location and instrument accordingly. A separate locative
survives for names of towns and a few nouns such as *domī* 'at home'. The goal of motion is
expressed by the accusative, there being no allative. Blake takes Latin as his running example
of an inflectional case system.

## Main declarations

* `Latin.Case`: the six cases, in the order of the school paradigms.
* `Latin.Case.label`, `Latin.Case.functions`: the comparative value each case is named for, and
  the values it expresses.
