# Turkish reciprocal pronouns

The Turkish reciprocal pronoun is the stem *birbir-* 'each other', which is obligatorily
inflected for person with the plural possessive suffixes: *birbirimiz* in the first person,
*birbiriniz* in the second, and *birbiri* or *birbirleri* in the third, where *birbirleri* is
the neutral form for interacting groups and *birbiri* is colloquial. The forms take case
suffixes, with *n* before the suffix in the third person, as in the accusative *birbirlerini*
([goksel-kerslake-2005]). Every form is plural, so a singular noun phrase is no antecedent of a
reciprocal.

As a direct object *birbirleri* stands before the verb and must be bound by a c-commanding
antecedent in its own clause, which is what [bakay-etal-2026] exploit: looks to a candidate at
the reciprocal reflect retrieval and not integration at the verb. The inflected forms of
*kendi-* 'self' have emphatic, reflexive, simple pronominal and resumptive uses
([goksel-kerslake-2005]) and are not entered here.

## Main definitions

* `Turkish.Anaphors.reciprocals` — the person forms of *birbir-*, with the accusative
  *birbirlerini*

## Main results

* `Turkish.Anaphors.number_reciprocals` — every form is plural
* `Turkish.Anaphors.not_candidateAntecedent_of_singular` — a singular nominal is no candidate
  antecedent of a reciprocal
