# Turkish converbs

Turkish chains clauses with converbial suffixes on the verb of each medial clause before a
single final verb, without switch-reference. *-(y)Ip* conjoins clauses of equal status in place
of the tense, aspect and modality suffixes, *-(y)ArAk* gives the manner or means, *-(y)IncA*
'when' sequences two events, *-(y)AlI* 'since' marks a starting point, *-mAdAn* 'without doing'
contains the negative, *-DIkçA* marks proportionality, and *-(y)ken* 'while' and *-cAsInA* 'as
if' attach not to the stem but to a tensed one, *-(y)ken* being the copula on a position-3
marker or a nominal. The converbs take no person marker, except the third-person plural on
*-(y)ken* and a person marker on *-mIşçAsInA*. Two more converbial subordinators go on a
doubled verb: *-(A/I)r … -mAz* 'as soon as' and *-(y)A … -(y)A*, continuous manner.

## Implementation notes

* Whether a converb takes a tense marker or the negative is read off the finite verb's slot
  order in `Turkish.Verb.system` from the slot the converb follows.
* The clause-chaining typology over the converbs is in `Studies/SarvasyAikhenvald2025.lean`.
