# Turkish coordinators

Turkish conjoins with the free word *ve* 'and', an Arabic loan, before the second coordinand,
and with the enclitic *de*, *da* by vowel harmony, which follows the first word of the second
coordinand, as in the example Haspelmath cites from Kornfilt. The enclitic is also the additive
particle 'also, too'. Noun phrases are also conjoined by *-(y)lA*, the comitative postposition
'with'. As a conjunction it attaches to the first conjunct, the two make a constituent that cannot
be broken up, and as a subject they take plural agreement; as a postposition it follows the
second noun phrase, which moves freely, and the verb agrees with the subject alone
([kornfilt-1997], §1.3.1.4; [goksel-kerslake-2005], §12.2.2.4, §28.3.1.1).

## Main definitions

* `Turkish.Coordination.ve`, `Turkish.Coordination.de`, `Turkish.Coordination.ile`: the
  conjunctive coordinator, the additive enclitic and the comitative enclitic.
