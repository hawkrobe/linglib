# Turkish case

This file defines the cases of Turkish. Göksel and Kerslake list five case suffixes, the
accusative *-(y)I*, the dative *-(y)A*, the locative *-DA*, the ablative *-DAn* and the genitive
*-(n)In*, and Blake's table adds the unmarked nominative for a system of six cases. The
suffixes are the case exponents of the nominal in `Morphotactics.lean`, which maps each to the
case it realizes and proves that they realize every case but the nominative, once each. The
comitative and instrumental *-(y)lA* is not a case suffix in the grammar's analysis but an
unstressable marker that forms postpositional phrases.

## Main definitions

* `Turkish.Case`, `Turkish.Case.label`: the six cases, and the comparative value each is named for
