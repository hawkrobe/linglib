# Turkish relative clauses

Turkish relative clauses precede their head and their verb is a participle, *-(y)En* when the
head is the subject and *-DIK* otherwise, with the subject of the clause in the genitive. With
the relativized position left empty this relativizes subjects through obliques. Below that a
pronominal element is retained, a possessive suffix on the head noun for genitives and a
stressed pronoun for objects of comparison, the latter with reduced acceptability. The data are
[keenan-comrie-1977]'s.
