# Turkish phonology

This file defines the segments of Turkish, its two vowel harmonies, the voicing of a
suffix-initial stop, and the surface form of a suffixed word, following the reference grammar
of Göksel and Kerslake.

Turkish has one vowel for each combination of [back], [round] and [high]. Fronting harmony
copies [back] from the preceding vowel to a suffix vowel, and rounding harmony copies [round]
to a high suffix vowel (Chapter 3). Suffix vowels are archiphonemes. The A of A-type suffixes
is non-high and unrounded but unspecified for [back] (§3.2.2), and the I of I-type suffixes is
high and unspecified for both features (§3.2.1). The targets of each harmony are therefore the
vowels lacking its feature, and a suffix vowel specified for it, such as the `o` of -(I)yor, is
skipped and triggers what follows (§3.4). Consonants are off both tiers, except that the
palatal l of loans such as *gol*, which Clements and Sezer discuss, carries [−back] and fronts
the suffix (§3.4). The suffix-initial D of -DI and -DA copies [voice] from the preceding
segment (§6.1.2).

The phonemes are segments named by their letters, and their feature values come from the
PHOIBLE chart. A vowel keeps the chart's values for the features that distinguish the
eight vowels, together with [voice], which the voicing of D copies. Among consonants [back] is
contrastive only on the palatal lateral, so every other consonant keeps each chart value but
[back], as in Clements and Sezer's analysis, where plain consonants are unspecified for the
feature and the palatals are linked to [−back]. There are two departures from the chart. Its
`a` is central, and the grammar's `a` is a back vowel. The palatal l is the chart's l with
[−back]. The archiphonemes `A`, `I` and `D` are meets, the features their alternants share.

Before -(I)yor a stem-final `a` or `e` becomes high and then harmonizes, as in *anlıyor* from
*anla-* and the negative *-mIyor* from *-mA* (§8.2.2, §8.2.3.3). The surface form of a word
applies that raising and then the three alternations. The spelling is phonemic, each letter
writing one segment.

## Main definitions

* `a`, `e`, …, `y`: the phonemes, in Göksel and Kerslake's phonemic spelling, so that
  underlying forms mix phonemes with archiphonemes, as in `[A, c, A, K]`; `vowels` and
  `consonants` are the sets of them.
* `A`, `I`, `D`, `K`: the suffix archiphonemes.
* `fronting`, `rounding`, `voicing`: the two vowel harmonies and D-voicing, as
  `Phonology.Harmony.System`s. The suffixes they apply to are the exponent forms of
  `Turkish.Morphotactics`.
* `raising`: the raising of a stem-final `a` or `e` before -(I)yor, as a
  `Subregular.LocalRewrite.Rule`.
* `surface`: the surface form of an underlying word.
* `ofChar`, `ofString?`: the segments that a spelled word writes.

## Main results

* `exists_mem_tur`: every phoneme but `a` and the two laterals is the segment of a phoneme of
  PHOIBLE's Turkish inventory.
* `unspecified_back_iff`, `not_unspecified_voice`: a consonant lacks [back] unless it is the
  palatal lateral, and every phoneme has a value for [voice], which the tier tests of fronting
  and voicing rely on.
* `setFeature_back_A`, `setFeature_voice_D`: an archiphoneme with its feature filled in is one
  of its alternants.

## Implementation notes

The raised vowel harmonizes for rounding as well as backness, as in *okşuyor* from *okşa-*, so
raising replaces the stem vowel by the archiphoneme `I` instead of setting [high] alone. The
loss of the suffix's own `I` after a vowel is a matter of attachment, in
`Turkish.Morphotactics`. The letters *ç*, *f*, *ğ* and *j* write segments outside the
inventory and have no value under `ofChar`. The grammar's examples are derived in
`Studies/GokselKerslake2005.lean`.
The inventory is PHOIBLE 2217, whose glyphs the chart entries follow, the coronals being
dental there. `K` is `k` without a value for [continuant] and not a meet, since the meet of
`k` and `ğ` would lack [voice] and so be a target of voicing.
