# Turkish evidentiality

Turkish has a two-choice system of Aikhenvald's type A2: the non-firsthand *-mIş*, covering
report, inference and non-visual perception, contrasts with evidentiality-neutral forms such as
the *-DI* past, which do not signal firsthand evidence but leave the source unspecified. The
non-firsthand is fused with tense and the copula.
