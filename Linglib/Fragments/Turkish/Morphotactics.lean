# Turkish morphotactics

This file defines the inflectional suffixes of the Turkish finite verb and nominal and the
order in which they appear, following the reference grammar of Göksel and Kerslake.

Turkish is suffixing. Derivational suffixes precede inflectional ones, and clitics follow both
(§6.3). The inflectional suffixes of a finite verb appear in the order root, voice, negation,
tense/aspect/modality, copular marker, person marker, -DIr (§8.2). The tense/aspect/modality
markers themselves fall into five positions (§8.2.3): the possibility suffix -(y)A (1), which
precedes the negative (§8.2.3.1), the bound auxiliaries (2), the markers of tense, aspect and
modality proper (3), the copular markers (4) and -DIr (5). Markers of one position cannot
co-occur, and every finite verb but the imperative and the third-person optative carries one
of position 3. The voice slot alone admits a sequence of suffixes, as the four of
*döğ-üş-tür-t-ül-* in (7) (§8.2, §8.2.1.1). The inflectional suffixes of a nominal appear in
the order number, possession, case (§8.1).

The finite verb and the nominal each have a slot inventory, the exponents of each slot, and a
template, a regular expression over the slots in which every position may be skipped and the
voice position repeated. The suffixes of a word are licensed when the list of their slots
matches the template. The person markers (§8.4) and the possessives (§8.1.2) are
`Agreement.Paradigm`s.

Vowels do not occur next to each other in Turkish, and the grammar brackets in a suffix's
citation form the initial segment whose presence depends on the stem (§6.1.3). The vowel of
-(I)m is lost after a vowel, as in *araba-m*, and the consonant of -(y)A, -(n)In and -(s)I
appears only after one, as in *masa-ya*. Both cases are one rule: a bracketed segment appears
exactly when it differs from the last segment of the stem in being a vowel.

## Main definitions

* `Turkish.Verb.Slot`, `Turkish.Verb.Exponent`, `Turkish.Verb.template`: the slots, exponents
  and template of the finite verb, and `Turkish.Verb.Licensed` the suffix strings it admits.
* `Turkish.Nominal.Slot`, `Turkish.Nominal.Exponent`, `Turkish.Nominal.template`: the same for
  the nominal.
* `Turkish.Suffix`, `Suffix.attach`: a suffix in citation form, with its bracketed initial
  segment, and its attachment to a stem.
* `Turkish.underlying`, `Turkish.realize`: the underlying and the surface form of a stem with
  a string of suffixes.
* `Exponent.form`: the citation form of an exponent.
* `Nominal.forms`: the forms of a string of nominal exponents, with the final `n` of a
  third-person possessive before a case suffix.

## Main results

* `Suffix.attach_concat_alternates`: a bracketed suffix attaches with vowels and consonants
  alternating across the juncture.
* `Suffix.attach_eq_elideV2`, `Suffix.attach_eq_epenthesize`, `Suffix.attach_concat_eq_repair`:
  after a vowel-final stem, attachment is one of the repairs of `Phonology.Hiatus`, elision of
  the suffix's vowel or insertion of its bracketed consonant.

## Implementation notes

The clitics mI and dA, which can interrupt the inflectional string (§6.3 (5)), are Chapter 11
material outside both templates. The markers' meanings are the matter of Chapter 21 and Appendix
2. There -DI marks past tense, perfective aspect and direct knowledge, -mIş marks relative past
tense, perfective aspect and indirect knowledge (evidential modality, §21.4.3), and the copular
-(y)mIş marks evidential modality alone; -mIş followed by a copular marker or -DIr is perfective
only (§8.2.3.3). The final `n` that the third-person possessives take before a case suffix
(§6.2, §8.1.2) belongs to neither citation form and is supplied by `Nominal.forms`. Negation of
the aorist is irregular, -mAz for -(A/I)r (§8.2.2; see `Turkish.Negation`). The grammar's
examples are checked against both templates in `Studies/GokselKerslake2005.lean`.
