# Cantonese phase complements

The postverbal phase complements of Cantonese, the grammaticalized second verbs that mark the
completion, attainment or result of the event, following [matthews-yip-1994] and
[cheung-2007], with the adversative *-can* of [sio-2020] and the anticipatory *-ding* of
[wong-shing-kit-2018]. The continuous *-zyu* is an aspect suffix and is entered in
`Fragments/Cantonese/Aspect.lean`. The classification of these complements as inner aspect, and
the diagnostics separating them from resultative verb compounds, are the analysis of
[liu-yip-2026] and live in `Studies/LiuYip2026.lean`.
