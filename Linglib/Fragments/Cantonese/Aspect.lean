# Cantonese aspect markers

The postverbal aspect suffixes of Cantonese (ISO `yue`) with the viewpoint each marks, following
[matthews-yip-1994] and [cheung-2007]: the perfective *-zo*, the experiential *-gwo*, an
experiential perfect, and the two imperfectives, the progressive *-gan* of ongoing activity and
the continuous *-zyu* of a maintained state or posture. The association of these suffixes with
the outer and inner aspect projections is the analysis of [liu-yip-2026] and lives in
`Studies/LiuYip2026.lean`; the postverbal *again*-suffix *-faan* is a presupposition trigger and
is entered with the other *again*-elements in `Fragments/Cantonese/Particles.lean`.
