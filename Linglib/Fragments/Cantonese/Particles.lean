# Cantonese *again*-elements

The Cantonese iterative presupposition triggers, following Matthews and Yip, are the preverbal
adverbs *jau* 又 and *zoi* 再, the counterparts of Mandarin *you* and *zai*
(`Fragments/Mandarin/Adverbs.lean`), the postverbal suffix *-faan* 返 'again, back', and the
postverbal repetitive *-gwo* 過 'again, anew', homophonous with the experiential aspect suffix of
`Fragments/Cantonese/Aspect.lean`. Their
association with the outer and inner aspect projections and their scope behaviour are the
analysis of Liu and Yip and live in `Studies/LiuYip2026.lean`.
