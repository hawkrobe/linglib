# Abkhaz evidentiality

Abkhaz has a two-choice system of Aikhenvald's type A2: a dedicated non-firsthand affix,
neutral to tense (*-zaap'* with present, aorist, perfect and one future; *-zaarən* with
imperfect, past indefinite, pluperfect and one future conditional), covers inference from
visible results and verbal report and is restricted to declarative main clauses, while the
unmarked forms leave the source unspecified. Turkish's non-firsthand is broader, taking in
non-visual perception as well.
