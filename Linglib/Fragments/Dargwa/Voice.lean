# Tanti Dargwa voice

This file defines the valency alternations of Tanti Dargwa as Sumbatova describes them. The
causative *-aq* is the only valency-changing morphology: the causee of an intransitive base is
the absolutive P of the derived clause, that of a transitive base an oblique in the
inter-elative, a locative form without the direction marker every spatial elative carries. The
antipassive is uncoded and confined to imperfective forms, and some transitive forms are
P-labile, the preterite *če-b-asː-un* meaning 'he glued it' or 'it stuck' where the future
tells the two apart by its thematic suffix.

## Main definitions

* `Dargwa.antipassive`, `Dargwa.anticausative`, `Dargwa.causativeOfIntransitive`,
  `Dargwa.causativeOfTransitive`, `Dargwa.alternations`: the valency alternations
* `Dargwa.causeeForm`: the inter-elative of the causee of a transitive base

## Main results

* `Dargwa.isCoded_iff`: the two causatives are the alternations coded on the verb
* `Dargwa.causativeOfIntransitive_fateOfRole_S`, `Dargwa.causativeOfTransitive_valency`: the
  causee of an intransitive base stays a core term; that of a transitive base is demoted as
  the causer is introduced, so the valency is unchanged
* `Dargwa.not_isSpatial_causeeForm`, `Dargwa.causeeForm_morphs`: the causee form is the
  directionless elative no spatial form is, *-cːe-r* after the oblique stem
* `Dargwa.labile_future_thematic`: the future forms of a P-labile verb differ in their
  thematic suffix

## Implementation notes

* The demoted causee and the antipassive patient are adpositional positions of the derived
  frame, the frame vocabulary's oblique; the case each takes is stated with the voice.
