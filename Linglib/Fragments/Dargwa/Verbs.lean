# Tanti Dargwa verbs

This file defines the light verbs and complex verbs of Tanti Dargwa as Sumbatova describes
them. A Dargwa verb is simplex, a bare root with at most a gender prefix, a preverb verb, or a
complex verb, a lexical stem followed by a light verb with any preverbs between them. The
lexical stems are noun, adjective, numeral, verb or ideophone stems, some of them found only in
the complex verb, and a few light verbs likewise occur only there. The valency alternations of
the verb are in `Voice.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `Dargwa.LightVerb`, `Dargwa.lightVerbs`: the light verbs, each with the meaning of the
  homophonous simplex verb where it has one
* `Dargwa.ComplexVerb`: a lexical stem, as a `Semantics.Root`, with its word class, preverbs
  and light verb

## Implementation notes

* A light verb is cited by its stem without the gender prefix, `agrees` recording the roots
  whose shape begins with the agreement slot. Sumbatova lists *aq-* both as 'hang' and among
  the light verbs found only in complex verbs; both entries are kept.
* The Muira Dargwa complex predicates of Kalyakin's study, with the position he assigns
  their roots, are in `Studies/Kalyakin2026.lean`.
