# Tanti Dargwa locative forms

This file defines the locative forms of Tanti Dargwa as Sumbatova describes them. A locative
form is the oblique stem followed by three suffix slots: a localization, the domain in space
with respect to the reference point, of which Tanti has eight; an orientation, whether the
object is in that domain, moving towards it, from it or across it; and a direction of the
motion with respect to the speaker, which the essive lacks, the elative requires and the lative
admits. The translative combines only with the localizations *sub*, *ante* and *post*, and
*post* with the translative alone. The orientations are the path heads of Pantcheva's
decomposition and the localizations refine its regions, so the forms fill the region-by-path
grid except for the route outside the exterior. An elative without the direction marker the
spatial paradigm demands has a non-locative use, as the causee of a transitive causative and
the standard of comparison.

## Main definitions

* `Dargwa.Localization`, `Dargwa.Orientation`, `Dargwa.Direction`: the three categories with
  their suffixes, and `Localization.region` and `Orientation.pathDir` their comparative labels
* `Dargwa.LocativeForm`: a form, with `LocativeForm.morphs` its suffixes and
  `LocativeForm.IsSpatial` the combinatorics of the spatial paradigm
* `Dargwa.comparisonStandard`: the super-elative of the standard of comparison

## Main results

* `Dargwa.LocativeForm.not_isSpatial_elative_none`: no directionless elative is spatial
* `Dargwa.LocativeForm.isSpatial_post_iff`: *post* takes the translative alone
* `Dargwa.LocativeForm.exists_isSpatial_iff`: the region-by-path grid is filled except for
  the route outside the exterior

## Implementation notes

* The essive is the localization followed by the gender marker, so `morphs` takes the marker.
* The direction suffixes are cited in their long forms; the short forms drop *-le*, and
  *-sale* and *-dale* vary with *-sele* and *-dele*. Whether the translative takes a direction
  marker is not stated, so `IsSpatial` leaves it open.
* The general-localization form of some nouns, *kis-na-b* 'in the pocket', is irregular and
  left out, as are the locative adverbs and postpositions, which inflect for orientation.
