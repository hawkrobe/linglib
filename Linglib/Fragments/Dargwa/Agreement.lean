# Tanti Dargwa agreement

This file defines the gender and person agreement of Tanti Dargwa as Sumbatova describes it.
Dargwa is among the few Nakh-Dagestanian languages with both. There are three genders,
masculine for men, feminine for women and neuter for animals and things, and the gender marker
a target shows distinguishes them only in the singular. In the plural it distinguishes humans
from non-humans, and humans again by whether they include the speaker or the addressee, which
is why [sumbatova-2021] counts three different plural genders. Gender agreement is controlled by
the absolutive argument, by the predicate in a copular clause with two absolutives, and in Tanti
a copula or essive in a transitive clause may agree with the ergative or dative instead.

Person agreement has three sets of markers and leaves the third person unmarked. In the clitic
and optative sets the second person singular stands against the first person and the second
person plural, the configuration [sumbatova-2021] calls the Dargic type after the literary Dargi
paradigm of [cysouw-2003]. A transitive verb agrees in person with the speech-act participant
when only one of its arguments is one, and otherwise with the absolutive P. The thematic suffix
of a transitive verb is *-i* when A outranks P on the person hierarchy 1, 2 > 3 and *-u*
otherwise, so it marks exactly the clauses in which the verb agrees with A.

## Main declarations

* `Dargwa.Gender.Value`: the three controller genders, with the singular and plural markers
  `Value.sgMarker` and `Value.plMarker`.
* `Dargwa.PersonSet`: the clitic, irrealis and optative sets of person markers.
* `Dargwa.personController`, `Dargwa.thematic`: the person agreement controller and the
  thematic suffix of a transitive clause.

## Main results

* `Dargwa.Gender.Value.sgMarker_injective`, `Dargwa.Gender.Value.plMarker_masc_eq_fem`: the
  singular markers distinguish the three genders; the plural ones do not.
* `Dargwa.PersonSet.realize_eq_nil_iff`: in every set, a cell is unmarked exactly when it is not
  a speech-act participant's.
* `Dargwa.isDargic_clitic`, `Dargwa.isDargic_optative`, `Dargwa.not_isDargic_irrealis`: the
  clitic and optative sets have the Dargic configuration, the irrealis set does not.
* `Dargwa.thematic_eq_i_iff`: the thematic suffix is *-i* exactly when A controls person
  agreement.

## Implementation notes

* A transitive clause is a `Clause.Scenario` of the persons of A and P. The thematic suffix is
  read off its kind on the binary scale `Person.Class`, as [sumbatova-2021] states it; the
  controller is the two-hierarchy rule as she states it.
* The masculine marker ‹w› is dropped or realized *-j* in some positions. Some nouns for liquids
  and granular substances take plural agreement, and a few nouns contain a gender marker of
  their own, which follows the referent's or the possessor's gender.
* Tanti has no clusivity, so the paradigms range over `Agreement.Bundle.pnCells`.
