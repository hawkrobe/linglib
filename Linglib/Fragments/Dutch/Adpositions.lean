# Dutch adpositions

This file defines the Dutch adposition as a lexical entry after Broekhuis and Corver's grammar.
An entry is the root `Adposition` with, for each position it takes relative to its complement,
the direction of the path a spatial use in that position denotes, and with whether it is used
with its complement omitted and whether its complement can be replaced by an R-word such as
*er*. The grammar sorts adpositions into prepositions, postpositions, circumpositions and
intransitive adpositions by that position, and into spatial, temporal and other adpositions by
the relation they mark. A spatial use is locational, referring to a location that the verb
reads as a place or as the result of a change of place, or directional, denoting a path whose
endpoint, starting point or interior is the reference object. Eight prepositions denote a path
and the others are locational, but every postpositional use denotes a path, so *op* is
locational before its complement, *op de berg* 'on the mountain', and denotes a goal path
after it, *de berg op* 'up the mountain'. Every postposition but *af* 'off' is also a
preposition. The complement of a non-spatial preposition that is morphologically complex,
*tijdens* 'during', cannot be R-pronominalized.

## Main definitions

* `Dutch.Adpositions.Adposition`: the entry.
* `Dutch.Adpositions.inventory`: the entries.

## Main results

* `Dutch.Adpositions.direction_post_ne_place`: every postpositional use denotes a path.
* `Dutch.Adpositions.pre_of_post`: every postposition but *af* is also a preposition.
* `Dutch.Adpositions.relation_ne_spatial_of_not_rPronoun`: the adpositions that resist
  R-pronominalization are non-spatial.

## Implementation notes

* The relation of a polysemous adposition is its spatial one where it has one: *voor* is
  recorded as spatial although it is also temporal, 'before', and marks a goal, 'for', and
  *door* as spatial although it also marks an agent and a cause. The grammar's complement
  types are the root's, a *te*-infinitive counting as a clause.
* The direction of a position records the grammar's classification of the use as locational or
  directional and, for a directional use, whether the complement is the endpoint, the starting
  point or a point on the path. The directional prepositions are the eight the grammar tests
  against verbs of location; *door* 'through', which the grammar marks as both, is recorded as
  locational, and *over* is two entries as in the grammar. The direction of a postpositional
  use is read off the grammar's gloss.
* A circumposition is an entry with a complex form and the circumpositional position, recorded
  with the direction of its directional use, since the grammar suspects that the locational
  uses of the circumpositions that have one are prepositional phrases with a particle.
* An entry with no complement type is a particle, used only without a complement; the grammar
  says that a particle has lost some of the spatial meaning of the adposition it is related to,
  and this file does not draw that line, recording only that the entry occurs without a
  complement.
