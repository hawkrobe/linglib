# Dutch adjectives

This file defines the Dutch adjective as a lexical entry and the rule for its attributive
ending. An entry is the root `Adjective` with the form it takes with the attributive ending
*-e*, where it takes one. By Broekhuis and Corver's grammar an attributive adjective takes the
ending unless its noun phrase is indefinite and its head noun a neuter singular or a neuter
non-count noun: *de oude stoel* 'the old chair', *een oude stoel*, *het oude paard* 'the old
horse', but *een oud paard*. An adjective ending in a schwa or in the long vowel written *a*,
*o* or *i*, *oranje* 'orange', *prima* 'excellent', and a substance adjective in *-en*, *gouden*
'golden', never takes the ending. The suffix *-heid* derives a common-gender noun from an
adjective, *roodheid* 'redness'. The entries are the colour, taste and evaluative adjectives
whose three forms McNally and de Swart compare, with the grammar's examples of the ending and
its exceptions.

## Main definitions

* `Dutch.Adjectives.Adjective`: the entry.
* `Dutch.Adjectives.attributive`: the attributive form of an adjective before a noun.
* `Dutch.Adjectives.heid`: the derived noun in *-heid*.

## Main results

* `Dutch.Adjectives.attributive_indefinite_neuter_singular`: the one cell of the grammar's
  table with no ending.
* `Dutch.Adjectives.oud_paard`: *een oud paard*, *het oude paard*, *oude paarden*.

## Implementation notes

* The forms of the grammar's summary table, one per definiteness, gender and number, with
  number neutralized for a non-count noun, are the values of `attributive`. The exceptions are
  entries with no inflected form rather than derived from the spelling, since the rule is
  phonological. A substance adjective is also attributive-only and non-gradable, and the entry
  records the latter with no scalar dimension.
* Which adjectives lack a noun in *-heid* is not recorded, since the paper says only that not
  all adjectives take the suffix, so `heid` is total.
