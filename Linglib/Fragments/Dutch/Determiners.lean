# Dutch determiners

This file records the Dutch articles and demonstratives after Broekhuis and Corver's grammar.
The definite article is *de* with common-gender singulars and with every plural and *het* with
neuter singulars, and it is one syncretic definite over the [schwarz-2009] use types. The
indefinite article *een* occurs with singular count nouns only, since indefinite plural and mass
noun phrases are bare. The negative article *geen* occurs with singular, plural and mass nouns
alike, and the grammar argues that it is a quantifier rather than an article. The proximate
demonstrative *deze* ~ *dit* and the distal demonstrative *die* ~ *dat* agree exactly as the
definite article does. These three agreeing determiners are the agreement evidence for the
two-gender carrier of `Dutch.Gender`.

## Main declarations

* `Dutch.Determiners.Target` enumerates the determiners whose singular form agrees in gender,
  and `Dutch.Determiners.singular` gives that form. `Dutch.Determiners.plural` is the
  common-gender form, which every plural takes.
* `Dutch.Determiners.injective_singular` shows that each agreeing determiner distinguishes the
  two genders, and `Dutch.Determiners.faithful` concludes that the carrier is faithful to the
  evidence.
* `Dutch.Determiners.inventory` is the inventory, whose citation forms are the plural forms,
  and `Dutch.Determiners.marking` derives its [moroney-2021] cell.

## Implementation notes

The uses of *de* are the [schwarz-2009] use types. The generic and proper-name uses of the
definite article, on which [schmuck-2020]'s micro-typology places Dutch between English and
German, are not `DefiniteUse` cells and so go unrecorded.
