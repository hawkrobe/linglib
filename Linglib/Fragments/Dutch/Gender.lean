# Dutch gender

Dutch has two controller genders. The common gender, which Broekhuis and Corver's grammar calls
non-neuter, is the merger of the historical masculine and feminine and is the gender of the
*de*-words; the neuter is the gender of the *het*-words. The definite article and the
demonstratives distinguish the two genders in the singular only, and
`Dutch.Determiners.singular` records that evidence. The genders are read off the determiners
rather than the pronouns, since pronominal agreement is partly semantic and follows the
individuation of the referent ([kraaikamp-2012]).
