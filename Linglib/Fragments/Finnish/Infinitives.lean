# Finnish infinitives

Karlsson names the Finnish infinitives after their function endings, as the *Iso suomen
kielioppi* does. There are the A infinitive, which is the dictionary form, the E infinitive,
the MA infinitive and the rare MINEN infinitive, traditionally the first to the fourth.
Infinitives take case endings as nouns do, but few of them. The A infinitive has its basic
form, a nominative, and a translative that takes a possessive ending, as in *sano-a-kse-ni*
'in order for me to say'. The E infinitive has an inessive of time, as in *sano-e-ssa* 'while
saying', and an instructive of manner, as in *itki-e-n* 'crying'. The MA infinitive has the
inessive, elative, illative, adessive and abessive, as in *luke-ma-ssa* 'reading', and a rare
instructive of necessity, as in *tule-ma-n*. The MINEN infinitive has only a nominative and a
partitive, both of obligation.

The A and E infinitives are built on the infinitive stem, and the MA and MINEN infinitives on
the inflectional stem, the stem of the present, as *ole-ma-* against *ol-la* 'be'. The ending
of the A infinitive depends on how its stem ends. It is -dA after a long vowel or a diphthong,
as in *saa-da* 'get', and -tA after `s`, as in *juos-ta* 'run'. After `l`, `n` or `r` it
repeats that consonant, as in *tul-la* 'come', and after a short vowel or a `t` it is -A, as
in *sano-a* 'say' and *huomat-a* 'notice'. The E infinitive changes the -A to -e, as in
*sano-e-* and *juos-te-*, and a final -e of the stem to -i, as in *luki-e-ssa* 'while reading'.

## Main definitions

* `Finnish.Infinitive`: the four infinitives.
* `Finnish.Infinitive.cases`: the cases an infinitive takes.
* `Finnish.Infinitive.aEnding`: the ending of the A infinitive after its stem.
* `Finnish.Infinitive.base`: a stem with an infinitive's function ending, before a case
  ending.

## Main results

* `Finnish.Infinitive.cases_subset_inventory`: an infinitive takes cases of the noun.
* `Finnish.Infinitive.toCase_mem_cases_ma_iff`: of the local cases the MA infinitive takes the
  interior series and, of the exterior series, the adessive alone.
* `Finnish.Infinitive.surface_base_e`: the E infinitive of Karlsson's stems in -e.

## Implementation notes

The stems *teh-* 'do' and *näh-* 'see' take -dA, which Karlsson lists among the exceptions, and
this is not represented. The partitive of the MINEN infinitive is built on -mis-, as in
*mene-mis-tä*, and a case ending after it is not derived.
