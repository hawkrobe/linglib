# Finnish morphotactics

A Finnish nominal takes number, case and possessive endings and clitics, always in that order,
as *pullo-i-ssa-nne-kin* 'in your bottles too' (Karlsson §3.1), and a non-finite verb form puts
the function ending of its infinitive before them, as *sano-e-ssa-ni* 'while I say' (§3.3). The
plural is -t in the nominative and -i elsewhere, -j between two vowels, and clitics come last,
more than one occasionally, as *on-ko-han* (§25.6).

Some endings determine more than their own position. The nominative plural -t stands on the
border between number and case, so no case ending follows it. The comitative -ine contains a
fossilized plural -i, so no number ending precedes it, and on a noun a possessive ending always
follows it (§16.4). Infinitives are never marked for number, each takes only its own cases
(`Finnish.Infinitive.cases`), and the translative of the A infinitive takes a possessive
ending (§22.2.2).

Before a possessive ending the final consonant of an ending is dropped, so that the nominative
and the genitive coincide, as in *ove-mme* 'our door, of our door', and the illative loses its
-n, as in *auto-o-ni* 'into my car'. The translative is -kse. After a case ending in a short
vowel the third person is usually -Vn, as in *talo-ssa-an* 'in his house', beside the older
-nsA, except after a partitive -A that follows a stem-final A, as in *kala-a-nsa* (§14.1).

## Main definitions

* `Finnish.Clitic`: the common clitics.
* `Finnish.Nominal.Slot`, `Finnish.Nominal.Exponent`, `Finnish.Nominal.template`: the positions,
  their exponents and their order.
* `Finnish.Nominal.WellFormed`: the strings of endings that make a word.
* `Finnish.Nominal.realize`: the surface forms of a stem with a string of endings.

## Main results

* `Finnish.Nominal.not_wellFormed_nominativePlural_case`,
  `Finnish.Nominal.not_wellFormed_comitative`: the nominative plural takes no case ending and a
  comitative needs a possessive ending.
* `Finnish.Nominal.continuations_third`: the third-person possessive ending after the inessive
  and after the illative.
* `Finnish.Nominal.realize_gen_possessive`: with a possessive ending the genitive is the
  nominative.

## Implementation notes

The genitive plural -ten, which follows the consonant stem of the singular without the plural
-i, as in *nais-ten* 'of the women', is not represented, nor the rarer clitics -kA and -s, nor
the passive of the E infinitive. Which alternant of an ending a stem takes is not represented
either, so a stem has every form its endings allow.
