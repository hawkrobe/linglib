# Finnish relative clauses

Finnish has two relative-clause strategies. The relative pronoun *joka* declines for the case of
the relativized position and introduces a postnominal clause; it relativizes subjects through
genitives. A participial clause precedes its head with no relativizer and the relativized
position left empty, the participle differing according to whether the head is its subject or
its object, as in *pöydällä tanssinut poika* 'the boy who had danced on the table' and
*näkemäni poika* 'the boy that I saw'; it relativizes subjects and direct objects only. Finnish
is the paper's example of a language whose broader, primary strategy is the case-coding one.
