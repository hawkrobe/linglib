# Finnish case endings

The endings of the Finnish cases in the singular, as Karlsson's table of cases gives them, in
his archiphonemic spelling: the suffix vowel `A` alternates by palatal harmony and the copy
vowel `V` repeats the nearest vowel before it. A case has one ending after a stem in a short
vowel, as in *auto-ssa* 'in a car' and *auto-on* 'into a car', and the partitive and the
illative have alternants that the shape of the stem selects: the partitive -tA and -ttA, as in
*vet-tä* 'water' and *perhe-ttä* 'family', and the illative -hVn and -seen, as in *maa-han*
'into the country' and *Porvoo-seen* 'to Porvoo'. The same endings follow the infinitives
(`Finnish.Infinitive`).

## Main definitions

* `Finnish.Declension.endings`: the endings of each case, the ending after a short vowel first.
* `Finnish.Declension.ending`: the ending of a case after a stem in a short vowel.

## Main results

* `Finnish.Declension.isSome_ending_iff`: the cases with an ending are the cases of the
  inventory.

## Implementation notes

Which alternant a stem takes is not represented. The endings after the plural and before a
possessive ending are in `Finnish.Nominal`.
