# Finnish comparison

Finnish compares with *X on Adj-mpi kuin Y*. The particle *kuin* marks the standard, a particle
comparative in the atlas, and a secondary construction puts the standard in the partitive
instead; Stassen classes Finnish as primarily particle and secondarily separative. The degree is
marked by the suffix *-mpi*, and the superlative is morphological.
