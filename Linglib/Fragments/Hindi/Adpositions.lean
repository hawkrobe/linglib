# Hindi postpositions

The simple postpositions of Hindi, *ne*, *ko*, *se*, *kaa*, *mẽ*, *par* and *tak*, as `Adposition`
entries. They follow the oblique form of the noun and have one shape in both numbers (Masica
p. 233), and they are clitics rather than affixes: a pause may separate them from the noun, and
one may scope over coordinated nouns, *madraas aur haiderabaad-se* 'from Madras and Hyderabad'
(Mohanan pp. 61–62; Masica p. 234). Each is an enclitic. The values marked are Mohanan's
labels, *ko* both accusative and dative (p. 61), with *se* the instrumental, sociative and
ablative at once (Masica p. 238); *tak* is the clitic Mohanan adds to the six (p. 61). *Kaa*
alone agrees, with the possessed noun, as Spencer notes.

## Main definitions

* `Hindi.Adpositions.inventory`: the simple postpositions.

## Implementation notes

* The sources agree that these are clitics and disagree on whether they realize case: Mohanan
  takes them to mark case features, Masica treats them as formal cases, and Spencer as
  postpositions that select the oblique, the only cases being the inflected forms of
  `Hindi.Case`.
* *Kaa* is recorded in its masculine singular direct form.
