# Tagalog phonology

This file defines the segments of Tagalog and the two outcomes of a prefix that ends in a nasal,
such as *maŋ-* and *paŋ-*, before a stem.

The nasal is a velar /ŋ/. Before a nasal, a glide or *h* it is unchanged, as in *paŋmarká*, and
before another consonant it takes that consonant's place, as in *pantabój* and *panlabás*.
Before an obstruent there is a second outcome, nasal substitution, in which the nasal and the
obstruent surface as one nasal at the obstruent's place, as in *mamigáj* from *bigáj*. Which
stems substitute is lexical and variable, which is the matter of the studies of Zuraw, of Zuraw
and Hayes and of Magri.

## Main definitions

* `consonants`, `vowels`: the phonemes of Zuraw's inventory.
* `assimilate`: a nasal takes the place of a following non-nasal consonant.
* `cluster`, `substituted`: a prefix in `ŋ` attached to a stem, with assimilation alone and
  with substitution of the stem-initial segment.

## Main results

* `exists_mem_tgl`: the phonemes are those of PHOIBLE's Tagalog inventory.
* `substitute_eq`: each obstruent substitutes to the nasal of its place, and the glottal stop
  to the velar nasal.
* `cluster_of_not_trigger`: the prefix nasal is unchanged before a nasal, a glide or *h*.

/-! ### The prefix nasal -/

/-- The consonants that a preceding nasal assimilates to, which are those that are not nasals.
The glides and `h` are not consonantal. -/
def trigger : Segment := Segment.ofSpecs [(.consonantal, true), (.nasal, false)]

/-- The obstruents, which can substitute. -/
def obstruent : Segment := Segment.ofSpecs [(.consonantal, true), (.sonorant, false)]

/-- `assimilate w` is the word `w` with each nasal assimilated to a following non-nasal
consonant. -/
def assimilate : List Segment → List Segment := NasalSubstitution.assimilate trigger ŋ

/-- `substitute x` is the nasal that the prefix nasal and a stem-initial `x` surface as under
substitution. -/
def substitute : Segment → List Segment := NasalSubstitution.substitute trigger ŋ

/-- `cluster pre stem` attaches the prefix that consists of `pre` and the nasal to `stem`, with
assimilation of the nasal to the stem-initial segment alone. -/
def cluster (pre : List Segment) : List Segment → List Segment
  | [] => pre ++ [ŋ]
  | x :: rest => pre ++ assimilate [ŋ, x] ++ rest

/-- `substituted pre stem` attaches the prefix that consists of `pre` and the nasal to `stem`,
with substitution of the stem-initial segment. -/
def substituted (pre : List Segment) : List Segment → List Segment
  | [] => pre ++ [ŋ]

/-- Each obstruent substitutes to the nasal of its place, and the glottal stop, which has no
place, to the velar nasal. -/

before an oral consonant and the velar nasal otherwise. -/

/-! ### Examples -/

/-- *mamigáj* 'to distribute' from *bigáj*, with substitution. -/
theorem mamigaj : substituted [m, a] [b, i, g, a, j] = [m, a, m, i, g, a, j] := by decide

/-- *pantabój* 'to goad' from *tabój*, with assimilation alone. -/
theorem pantaboj : cluster [p, a] [t, a, b, o, j] = [p, a, n, t, a, b, o, j] := by decide

/-- *pansúlat* 'writing instrument' from *súlat*, with an alveolar nasal before `s`. -/
theorem pansulat : cluster [p, a] [s, u, l, a, t] = [p, a, n, s, u, l, a, t] := by decide

the cluster inside the stem, which is not homorganic, so that assimilation is confined to the
prefix as well. -/
