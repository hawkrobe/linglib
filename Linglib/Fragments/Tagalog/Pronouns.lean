# Tagalog pronouns

Tagalog has eight personal pronouns, one for each of Cysouw's referential categories and no
two sharing a form: the speaker *ako*, the addressee *ikaw* (enclitic *ka*), a third party
*siya*, the speaker and addressee *kata*, the speaker and addressee with others *tayo*, the
speaker with others *kami*, the addressees *kayo* and the others *sila*. Each comes in three
case series: the *ang* forms for the subject, the *ng* forms for possessors and for non-subject
agents and objects, and the *sa* forms for obliques, which Himmelmann labels specifier,
possessive and locative and Kroeger nominative, genitive and dative. The inclusive is split
between a dual *kata* and a plural *tayo*, the minimal-augmented type of Cysouw's first-person
hierarchy. Schachter and Otanes note that the dual is obsolescent in educated Manila Tagalog,
where *tayo* covers both, and that the *kita* Himmelmann lists beside *kata* is a portmanteau
of the first-person singular *ng* form and the second-person singular *ang* form, not a dual.

## Main definitions

* `Tagalog.ang`, `Tagalog.ng`, `Tagalog.sa` — the three case series, a form for each category
* `Tagalog.entry`, `Tagalog.pronouns` — the pronoun entries, with the person and number of
  their category

## Main results

* `Tagalog.entry_categories`, `Tagalog.entry_wellFormed` — an entry denotes its category
* `Tagalog.paradigm_nom` — the inventory's subject paradigm is the *ang* series
* `Tagalog.ang_injective` — no two categories share an *ang* form
