# Czech declension

This file defines the declension classes of Czech nouns after Short's grammar, with the
conditions on velar stems that the Academy grammar *Mluvnice češtiny* states as rules, and gives
the Czech paradigms of Caha's tables of Slavic syncretism.

A Czech noun inflects for seven cases and two numbers (p. 465). Short's Tables 9.2 to 9.7
(pp. 465–470) decline one model noun for each declension: *chlap* 'fellow' and *hrad* 'castle'
for the hard masculines, "one class, subdivided according to animacy" (p. 465), *muž* 'man' and
*stroj* 'machine' for the soft masculines, *město* 'town', *srdce* 'heart' and *učení* 'study'
for the neuter o-stems, *žena* 'woman', *hrdina* 'hero', *duše* 'soul' and *paní* 'lady' for the
a-stems, *kost* 'bone' for the i-stems and *jehně* 'lamb' for the neuter t-stems. A class here is
the declension of one model noun, and its endings are the table's, every alternant the table
prints in the order it prints them. Short states two conditions on stems besides: a velar
stem of the hard masculines takes the vocative singular *-u* (pp. 465–466), and the second
palatalization of velars replaces *k*, *h*, *g* and *ch* by *c*, *z*, *z* and *š* (p. 462).

*Mluvnice češtiny* states the vocative condition as a rule (pp. 292, 305), and a second one on
velar stems that Short gives by example alone (Short, pp. 462, 467): a velar stem of the hard
masculines and of the masculine a-stems takes the locative plural *-ích*, where the others take
*-ech* (pp. 292, 295, 300, 305). It makes the alternation of the velar obligatory before *-ích*
in the locative plural of the masculines and before *-i* in the nominative plural of the
masculine animates (p. 279), and a stem is inflected with the second palatalization there.

Caha's paradigms are each a word in one number by its form in the six cases the Slavic
languages share. An entry marked colloquial is the colloquial paradigm Caha sets beside the
literary one, and where the tables decline a word in two ways without naming the variety, the
second paradigm is primed.

## Main definitions

* `Czech.Declension.Cell`: a case of the seven and a number
* `Czech.Declension.Class`: the declensions of Short's tables, by model noun
* `Czech.Declension.Class.gender`: the gender each table is for
* `Czech.Declension.Class.endings`: the endings of a class at each cell
* `Czech.Declension.finalPhoneme`: the final phoneme of a stem
* `Czech.Declension.IsVelar`, `Czech.Declension.Class.endingsOn`: the velar vocative singular
  and locative plural
* `Czech.Declension.palatalize`: the second palatalization of velars on a stem
* `Czech.Declension.Class.Palatalizes`, `Czech.Declension.Class.inflect`,
  `Czech.Declension.Class.formsOn`: where a stem palatalizes, and the forms of a class on a stem
* `Czech.Declension.paradigms`: Caha's Czech paradigms

## Main results

* `voc_eq_nom_plural`: the vocative plural is the nominative plural in every class
* `animacy_plural`: the masculine animates and inanimates differ in the plural only in the
  nominative and the vocative
* `acc_eq_gen_singular_iff`: the animate accusative singular is the genitive, except in the
  masculine a-stems
* `dat_loc_singular_iff`: the dative and locative singular fall together in every class but the
  hard masculine inanimates and the neuter o-stems
* `dat_singular_u_ovi`: the masculine dative singular *-u* is that of the hard masculines, and
  *-ovi* alone that of the masculine a-stems
* `isVelar_singleton_iff`: the velar letters are *k*, *g*, *h* and *ch*, and they palatalize to
  *c*, *z*, *z* and *š*
* `endingsOn_voc_velar`, `formsOn_locPl_velar`, `palatalize_examples`: the grammars' examples
  of the stem conditions

## Implementation notes

An ending is a list of orthographic segments, *ch* being one letter of the Czech alphabet
(p. 459), as the forms data segment words, and the null ending is the empty list. The
orthography spells a palatal *ď*, *ť* or *ň* on the following *ě* or *i* and on the consonant
before *a*, *o*, *u* or finally (p. 459), so the stem of *jehně* is written *jehn-* before the
*ě* of the singular endings and *jehň-* before the *a* of the plural ones. The endings are those
of the tables, save on a velar stem, where the vocative singular *-u* and the locative plural
*-ích* of *Mluvnice češtiny*'s rules replace the table's *-e* and *-ech*. The variation Short
describes in prose without a table alternant is left out: the locative singular *-ě* or *-u* of
the hard inanimates (p. 466) and the neuters (p. 467), the genitive singular *-a* or *-u* of the
inanimates (p. 466), the nominative plurals in *-é* and *-ové* of "subclasses not recorded in the
tables" (p. 466), and the locative plural *-ách* of suffixed velar neuters (pp. 466–467). So are
the locative plural *-ách* after a velar that *Mluvnice češtiny* allows in everyday speech
(pp. 292, 295, 300), the *-ích* it gives the masculine a-stems in a soft consonant, as *rikších*
(p. 292), since it lists no soft consonants, and its vocative *-e* of *člověče* and *bože* (p. 294).
`palatalize` is the second palatalization of velars alone, and a stem is palatalized only before
the plural *-i* and *-ích*: not where the alternation is of *r*, as *bratr–bratři* (*Mluvnice
češtiny*, p. 294), nor before the singular *-ě*, whose spelling it changes too, as the
dative-locative singular *ruce* of *ruka* (Short, p. 462). The palatal dentals are written as the
plain ones before *i* (Short, p. 459). The types Short describes without a table, the animates in
*-ce* (p. 466) and the *píseň* type (p. 468), have no class.

The stem conditions are stated over the phonemes that the stem's letters write
(`Czech.Phonology.ofChars`): a stem is velar when its final phoneme is one of
`Czech.Phonology.palatalizing`, and `palatalize` replaces that phoneme by its reflex under
`Czech.Phonology.secondPalatalization` and writes the reflex with its letter. The endings stay
lists of letters. The alternation of *d*, *t* and *n* with *ď*, *ť* and *ň* before a front vowel
and the /j/ after a labial before *ě* (Short, pp. 459, 462) are not rules here: the spelling
writes them on the *ě* or *i* of the ending, so a form's phonemes are read from its letters and
not composed from the stem's and the ending's. Stating these alternations as rules is the step
that would make the endings lists of phonemes.

Czech keeps the vocative, which `Slavic.Declension.Cell`, the six cases the Slavic languages
share, leaves out, so its cells are its own. Caha's paradigms are `Slavic.Declension.Paradigm`s
over those six cases.

/-- A stem is velar when its final phoneme is one that the second palatalization changes, *k*,
*g*, *ch* or *h*. Short counts /h/ among the laryngeals (p. 457), but it alternates with *z* as
*g* does in the second palatalization (p. 462) and takes the velar vocative, as *vrahu*
'murderer' (p. 465). -/
def IsVelar (s : List String) : Prop := ∃ x ∈ finalPhoneme s, x ∈ Phonology.palatalizing

instance : DecidablePred IsVelar := fun s ↦ inferInstanceAs (Decidable (∃ x ∈ finalPhoneme s, _))

/-- The endings of a class on a stem are those of its table, except on a velar stem.

A velar stem of the hard masculines takes *-u* in the vocative singular: "The u-stem vocative
ending also survives, chiefly as a means to avoid palatalization of velar stems, for example,
*kluku* 'boy', *vrahu* 'murderer'" (p. 465), the forms in *-e* with palatalization, *člověče*
'man' and *bože* 'God', being "used chiefly as interjections" (pp. 465–466). *Mluvnice češtiny*
states it as a rule: the hard masculine animates take *-e* after a non-velar and *-u* after a
velar, *pane*, *dělníku* (p. 292), *-e* after a velar being confined to *člověče*, *bože* and
expressive use (p. 294), and the inanimates *-u* after a velar, *jazyku*, *prachu*, *prahu*
(p. 305).

A velar stem of the hard masculines and of the masculine a-stems takes *-ích* in the locative
plural, which Short gives by example, *geolozích* (p. 462) and *sluzích* (p. 467), and *Mluvnice
češtiny* as the rule: the non-velar stems of these classes take *-ech*, *pánech*, *předsedech*,
and the velar ones *-ích*, *dělnících*, *sluzích* (p. 292), *filolozích* (p. 295), *kolezích*

de-affricated from *dz* to *z*" (p. 462), and writes the reflex with its letter. Short's examples
of it in declension are the dative-locative singular of the a-stems, *ruka/ruce* 'hand' (p. 462)
and *matka/matce* 'mother' (p. 467), and the locative plural in *-ích* of velar stems,

/-! ### Caha's paradigms

Two of Caha's paradigms differ from Short's tables in the locative singular: `hrad_sg` has
*hradu* and `mesto_sg` *městu* where Short's Tables 9.2 and 9.4 give *hradě* and *městě*, both
within the variation between *-ě* and *-u* that Short describes for the hard inanimates
(p. 466) and the neuters (p. 467). -/
