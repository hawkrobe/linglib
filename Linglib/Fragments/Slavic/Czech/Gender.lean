# Czech noun gender

This file defines the controller genders of Czech. Short counts three genders, "the
subcategory of animacy functioning within the masculine only" (p. 465), and agreement treats
the masculine animate and the masculine inanimate as two classes: "Agreement with mixed-gender
noun phrases (for past tenses and conditional) is dominated in turn by any masculine–animate,
masculine–inanimate and feminine" (p. 503), so that *Pes a kočka seděli na rohožce* 'The dog and
the cat were sitting on the mat' takes the masculine animate plural and *Dům i stáda byly
zničeny* 'The house and flocks were destroyed' the masculine inanimate plural. The controller
genders are therefore four, and the comparative labels merge the two masculines.
