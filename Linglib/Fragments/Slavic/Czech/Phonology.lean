# Czech phonology

This file defines the phonemes of Czech as segments, the natural classes of its velar
alternations, the second palatalization of velars and the reading of Czech spelling as
phonemes, after Short's description of the language. Czech has five vowels, each short and
long, and twenty-five consonantal phonemes. The second palatalization replaces *k* by *c*, *h*
and *g* by *z*, and *ch* by *š*. Short files *h* among the laryngeals, and in the features of
the PHOIBLE chart it is not dorsal, so the four segments the rule changes are not the dorsals.
They are a natural class all the same, the obstruents that are neither labial nor coronal.

The spelling is close to the phonemes. A palatal *ď*, *ť* or *ň* is written on a following *ě*
or *i*, as in *dě* and *di*, a labial before *ě* is followed by /j/ and *m* by /ň/, and *i* and
*y* write one vowel.

## Main definitions

* `Czech.Phonology.a`, `Czech.Phonology.ch` and the like: the phonemes, named by the letters
  Short writes them with, and `Czech.Phonology.inventory` the set of them.
* `Czech.Phonology.dorsals`, `Czech.Phonology.palatalizing`: the velars *k*, *g* and *ch*, and
  these with *h*.
* `Czech.Phonology.secondPalatalization`: the second palatalization of velars.
* `Czech.Phonology.ofString?`, `Czech.Phonology.letter`: the phonemes a word writes, and the
  letter that writes a phoneme.

## Main results

* `Czech.Phonology.exists_mem_ces`, `Czech.Phonology.ofPhoneme_mem_or`: the phonemes are those
  of PHOIBLE's Czech inventory.
* `Czech.Phonology.naturalClass_palatalizing`: the segments the second palatalization changes
  are the obstruents that are neither labial nor coronal.
* `Czech.Phonology.voiced_mem_iff`, `Czech.Phonology.devoiced_mem_iff`: the obstruents paired
  in [voice], all but *c*, *č*, *ch* and *h*.
* `Czech.Phonology.secondPalatalization_g`, `Czech.Phonology.not_exists_merge_eq`: the reflex
  of *g* is that of *k* voiced and de-affricated, so no one feature change gives the rule.
* `Czech.Phonology.mem_inventory_of_mem_ofString?`: the spelling writes phonemes of the
  inventory.

## Implementation notes

The inventory is PHOIBLE 1140, whose consonants are Short's twenty-five and whose vowels are
his five short and five long vowels and three diphthongs. PHOIBLE marks /oː/ and the diphthongs
/au/ and /eu/ marginal, the three that Short confines to loan-words (p. 456). PHOIBLE's other
Czech inventories, 2274 and 2480, add the glottal stop and the voiced affricate [dž], which
Short counts as not phonemic (p. 457).

Hayes's features have no length, so a long vowel is two segments of its quality, and a
diphthong, which the chart omits as contour-valued, is its two vowels. A vowel keeps the
features that distinguish the five, since the chart gives the short high vowel as the lax [ɪ]
and the long one as the tense [iː]. The chart's *t*, *d* and *n* are alveolar where Short calls
them dental, a difference in [distributed] on which no Czech contrast depends.

`ofString?` reads the phonemes and not their realization: the final devoicing and the voicing
assimilation of obstruents (p. 458) are left out, so that *oběd* 'lunch' is /objed/ where Short
writes /objet/. It follows Short's rules for the palatals without exception, so a loan-word in
which *di*, *ti* or *ni* writes a plain dental is misread, and it reads *x* as [ks], one of
Short's two readings.
