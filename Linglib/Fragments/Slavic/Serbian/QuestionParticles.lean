# Serbian question particles

Serbian polar questions are marked by intonation alone, by the enclitic *li*
hosted by the fronted finite verb, or by sentence-initial *da li*, which
[browne-1993] regards as the full form of *li* and which leaves the order of
the rest of the clause free; both markers also introduce embedded and
alternative questions. Colloquial *je li* and the mirative *zar* are the
tag-forming markers *je li?* and *zar ne?* of [browne-1993]; [simik-2024]
reports *je li* as the colloquial rival of the neutral *da li* strategy and
*zar* as the Serbian kin of Russian *razve*, whose formal semantics the
chapter leaves open. Bias profiles of the strategies live in `Simik2024`.
