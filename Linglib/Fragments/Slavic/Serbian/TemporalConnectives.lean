# Serbian temporal connectives

Lexical entries for the Serbian temporal connectives *pre* 'before', which takes a clause as *pre
nego što*, and *posle* 'after'. The aspect of the embedded verb fixes which bound of the embedded
event the host precedes, the imperfective its onset and the perfective its culmination
([rett-2020a], the paper's (11)).
