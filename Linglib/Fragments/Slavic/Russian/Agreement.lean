# Russian agreement targets

Russian adjectives have a long form, declined for gender, number and case and used both
attributively and predicatively, and a short form, marked for gender and number and used
predicatively alone. Finite verbs express person and number in the nonpast tenses and gender
and number in the past tense. Each target's forms are tabulated in Wade's grammar.

## Implementation notes

Whether an inflected value is copied from a controller is a question about a position and is
left to the studies: a predicative long form is inflected for case, but its case is fixed by
the copula, nominative or instrumental, rather than shared with the subject. The witness
theorems read the inflection off the paradigms of `Fragments/Slavic/Russian/Gender.lean`.

## TODO

* The long adjective's full declension and the nonpast conjugation are not recorded, so the
  case and person dimensions have no witness theorem.
