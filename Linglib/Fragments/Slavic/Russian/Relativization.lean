# Russian relative clauses

Russian has one relative-clause strategy, postnominal, with the relative pronoun *kotoryj*
declining for the case of the relativized position: *devuška, kotoruju Džon ljubit* 'the girl
who John likes' against *devuška, kotoraja ljubit Džona* 'the girl who likes John', the
paper's illustration of a case-coding strategy. It relativizes subjects through genitives. The
participial construction that relativizes subjects only, which the paper mentions for Russian
alongside German and Polish, is not entered in its Table 1 and is not recorded here. The data
are [keenan-comrie-1977]'s.
