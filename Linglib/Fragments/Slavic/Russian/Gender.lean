# Russian noun gender

This file defines the three controller genders of Russian, masculine, feminine and neuter, and
nouns with their gender, the gender of their referents where they have one, and their declension
class. Gender is partly fixed by the referent and partly by the declension ([corbett-1991]):
*djadja* 'uncle' declines like most feminines and is masculine by its referents, and the
soft-sign nouns are feminine as a rule ([wade-2020] §63) but for *put'* 'way', of which "Despite
feminine endings in the genitive, dative and prepositional singular, путь is qualified by masculine
adjectives" (§66). The declension classes are Corbett's as [kramer-2020] reports them: *zakon*,
*škola*, *kost'* and *vino* are her examples of the correlation of class and gender (18), the
neuter *znamja* 'banner' (Wade §64) and the masculine *put'* of its exceptions (19), and the
kinship and animal nouns stand for the semantic core (17). *Vrač* 'doctor' is masculine but takes
feminine agreement on a predicate when the referent is female, *Врач обязана помочь больному* 'The
doctor is obliged to help the patient' ([wade-2020] §313); the file records its declensional
gender, and the hybrid agreement is in `Studies/Kramer2020.lean`.

The past-tense concord of the verb and the nominative endings of the adjective are the agreement
evidence that the three genders are distinct ([corbett-1991]).
