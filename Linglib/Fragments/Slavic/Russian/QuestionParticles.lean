# Russian question particles

Russian marks formal polar questions with the second-position enclitic *li*, obligatory in
embedded polar questions, while colloquial matrix polar questions are marked by intonation alone
and can be used rhetorically ([esipova-romero-2023]). The clause-initial mirative *razve* cannot be
used in embedded interrogatives or in wh-interrogatives ([simik-2024] §4.2.4, after Korotkova);
*neuželi* is its sibling that lexicalizes VERUM.

/-- ли li is the neutral polar question particle (formal register), a
second-position enclitic on the focused constituent. -/

    | .declarative, .matrix => some .excluded
    | .polar, .matrix => some .optional
    | .polar, .subordinated => some .obligatory

/-- разве razve is the mirative/dubitative question particle, signalling
conflict between the speaker's prior epistemic state and current
contextual evidence. -/
def razve : Particle where
  form := "razve"
  script := some "разве"

/-- неужели neuželi is the mirative question particle that, unlike *razve*,
lexicalizes VERUM and so combines with inner negation only
([repp-geist-2022] as reported by [simik-2024]). -/
def neuzeli : Particle where
  form := "neuželi"
