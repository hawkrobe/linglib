# Hungarian polarity items

This file types the person members of the Hungarian negative and free-choice series of
`Hungarian.Indefinites` as polarity items. *senki* 'nobody' is a strict negative-concord item:
it requires clausemate negation, and under negation in a higher clause it gives way to *valaki
is*, as Kenesei, Vago and Fenyvesi show (§1.4.3, §1.4.5), who call *senki* and *semmi*
universal negative polarity items. *akárki* and *bárki* 'anyone' are free-choice items, as in
*Akárki jöhet a konferenciára* 'Anyone may come to the conference'. Haspelmath (A.26.3) finds
the two series mainly in the free-choice function, but also in comparatives, under indirect
negation and, with an emphatic value, in conditionals, and stars both under direct negation and
in questions.

## Implementation notes

The comparative *mint akárhol Európában* 'than anywhere in Europe' is listed under the clausal
comparative, the licensing theory's routing of a surface *than NP*; the indirect negation of
Haspelmath's (A202), negation in a higher clause, has no licensing context. A weak negative
polarity item is licensed under clausal negation and in questions, so the licensing theory admits
both series where Haspelmath stars them (`freeChoice_excluded_admitted`); his implicational map
describes the series by a region of functions instead.
