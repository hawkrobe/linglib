# Yakut (Sakha) case

Sakha has eight cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, instrumental,
comitative and partitive. The genitive is homophonous with the nominative except after a
third-person possessive suffix. [baker-vinokurova-2010]'s account of how the structural cases
are assigned is in `Studies/BakerVinokurova2010.lean`. The suffixes are [stachowski-menz-1998]'s
(p. 421), who count no genitive and add a comparative in *-TĀγAr*; the comitative is *-LĪn*, after
kinship terms *-nĀn*.

## Implementation notes

* Suffixes are written in Stachowski and Menz's notation, a capital for a consonant or vowel that
  assimilates to the stem.
* The genitive is recorded with the nominative's empty exponent; its form after a possessive
  suffix is not recorded.
