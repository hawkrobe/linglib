# San Martín Peras Mixtec pronouns

San Martín Peras Mixtec (Mixtecan, Oto-Manguean; ISO 639-3 `jmx`) has a clitic and a non-clitic
series of personal pronouns, neither inflected for case. The local persons distinguish singular
and plural, and inclusive and exclusive in the first person plural; every local cell except the
inclusive has a form in both series. The nonlocal persons have clitics only, one for each of six
genders: neutral, feminine, masculine, liquid, wooden and animal. Only the neutral and the
feminine have separate plural clitics, so *=rà* means 'he' or 'they (all male)'. A clitic cannot
be coordinated, stand alone or bear focus. Where the non-clitic series has no form, a clitic is
strengthened by a demonstrative, as in *yé yo'o* 'we (incl.) here', or by the definite article
*mí*, which with a clitic also forms the reflexive, as in *mí =rà* 'himself'.

## Implementation notes

The genders are the carrier `Gender.Value`, visible only on the nonlocal clitics.
`Gender.Value.toLabel` gives the comparative label of the feminine and the masculine; the other
four genders have none. A clitic with no plural counterpart has `number := some .general`, so it
realizes both the singular and the plural third person. The strengthened forms are phrases and
are not entries; neither is the prevocalic allomorph *=(y)à* of the neutral clitic.
