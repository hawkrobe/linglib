# Indonesian verbs

This file defines the Indonesian verbs of Beavers and Udayana's study of the middle voice and
three verbs that show the readings of the prefix *ter-* in Sneddon's grammar.

An entry records the segments of the root, whether the root has a middle in *ber-*, and the
reading of its *ter-* form if it has one. The prefixed forms are derived, the active by the
nasal alternation of `Indonesian.Phonology.meN`.

## Main definitions

* `TerClass`: the stative, accidental and abilitative readings of *ter-*.
* `Indonesian.Verb`: a verb entry, with the forms `Verb.meN`, `Verb.di`, `Verb.ber?` and
  `Verb.ter?`.
* `verbs`: the entries of this file.

/-! ### Readings of *ter-* -/

/-- The three readings of a verb in *ter-* in Sneddon's grammar. Some verbs have more than one,
as *terbuka* 'open', which can also be accidental or abilitative. -/
inductive TerClass where
  /-- The state that follows an action, as in *tertulis* 'written'. -/
  | stative
  /-- An action that was not intended, as in *terbawa* 'taken by mistake'. -/
  | accidental
  /-- The ability to carry out the action, as in *tidak terbeli* 'cannot be afforded'. -/
  | abilitative
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

namespace TerClass

/-- A stative *ter-* verb involves no action and so has no actor, and an accidental or
abilitative one can take an agent phrase with *oleh*. -/
def HasAgent (c : TerClass) : Prop := c ≠ .stative

instance : DecidablePred HasAgent := fun _ ↦ inferInstanceAs (Decidable (_ ≠ _))

/-- An accidental *ter-* verb marks the action as not intended, and the other two readings
leave volition open. -/
def volitionality : TerClass → Volitionality
  | .accidental => .nonvolitional
  | .stative | .abilitative => .neutral

/-- An abilitative *ter-* verb keeps the suffix *-kan* or *-i* of its base, as in
*terpecahkan* 'can be solved', which the other two readings drop. -/
def RetainsSuffix (c : TerClass) : Prop := c = .abilitative

instance : DecidablePred RetainsSuffix := fun _ ↦ inferInstanceAs (Decidable (_ = _))

end TerClass

/-- *menambat* and *bertambat*. Substitution takes the root-initial `t` and leaves the cluster
inside the root. -/

      tambat.ber? = some [b, e, r, t, a, m, b, a, t] := by

/-- *menyisir*, with the palatal nasal for the root-initial `s` and the second `s` kept. -/

    dengar.meN = [m, e, n, d, e, ng, a, r] ∧ dengar.di = [d, i, d, e, ng, a, r] := by
  decide

/-- The active keeps the whole root after a root-initial segment that is not substituted, and
loses exactly that segment otherwise. -/
theorem meN_suffix :
    ∀ v ∈ verbs, ∀ x ∈ v.rootSegments.head?,
      if x ∈ substituting then v.rootSegments.tail <:+ v.meN ∧ ¬ v.rootSegments <:+ v.meN
