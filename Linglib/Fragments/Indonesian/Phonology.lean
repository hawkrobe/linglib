# Indonesian phonology

This file defines the segments of Standard Indonesian and the alternation of the nasal that
ends the prefixes *meN-* and *peN-*.

The nasal is a velar /ŋ/. It takes the place of a following obstruent, as in *membeli* from
*beli*, and it is lost before a nasal, a liquid or a glide, as in *melihat* from *lihat*. A
root-initial *p*, *t*, *k* or *s* fuses with it into one nasal, as in *memakai* from *pakai*,
which is called nasal substitution. Following Pater, assimilation applies throughout the word
and fusion only at the left edge of the root.

## Main definitions

* `consonants`, `vowels`: the phonemes, named by their spelling. `e` is the schwa and `é` is /e/.
* `assimilate`: each nasal of a word takes the place of a following obstruent, by the rules of
  `Phonology/NasalSubstitution.lean`.
* `substituting`, `fuse`: the consonants that fuse with the prefix nasal, and the nasal that
  results.
* `juncture`: what the prefix nasal and the base-initial segment surface as.
* `meN`, `peN`: the two prefixes attached to a base.

## Main results

* `exists_mem_ind`: the phonemes are those of PHOIBLE's Standard Indonesian inventory.
* `voicelessObstruents_sdiff_substituting`: the voiceless obstruents that do not fuse are *c*
  and the fricatives of loans.
* `juncture_of_sonorant`, `juncture_of_vowel_or_h`, `juncture_of_obstruent`: the juncture for
  each class of base-initial segment.
* `fuse_eq`: the fused nasals are *m*, *n*, *ng* and, for *s*, *ny*.

## Implementation notes

That *c* does not fuse and that *s* fuses into the palatal *ny* are the two exceptions that
McDonnell and colleagues list for the standard language. The *menge-* of one-syllable bases is
not defined.
