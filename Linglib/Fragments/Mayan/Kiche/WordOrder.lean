# K'iche' word order

K'iche' (K'ichean Mayan) is verb-initial. Intransitive clauses are verb–subject, and transitive
clauses are verb–object–subject, the preferred order Mondloch describes, or verb–subject–object;
subject-initial orders are increasingly found under Spanish contact. Clemens and Coon survey the
derivational accounts of Mayan verb-initiality.
