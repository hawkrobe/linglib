# Mayan person marking

Mayan languages cross-reference the arguments of the verb with two sets of person markers,
called Set A and Set B by Mayanists. Set A marks the transitive subject and, on a noun, the
possessor; Set B marks the intransitive subject and the transitive object. Both sets occupy
fixed positions in the verbal complex, the word built from an aspect marker, the person
markers, the verb stem and a status suffix, and the position of Set B divides the family: in
the highland languages of Guatemala (K'ichean, Mamean, Q'anjob'alan) Set B follows the aspect
marker and precedes the stem, while in the lowland languages (Cholan, Tseltalan, Yucatecan) it
follows the stem. [tada-1993] and [coon-mateo-pedro-preminger-2014] call the two settings high
and low absolutive and observe that the high-absolutive languages ban the extraction of
transitive subjects. Third person singular Set B has no segmental exponent in most of the
family, a pattern [kaufman-norman-1984] reconstruct for proto-Mayan. Many Mayan languages
split their alignment by aspect or clause type, Set A extending to every subject in the
non-perfective aspects or in clauses without an aspect marker; [aissen-england-zavala-2017]
survey the splits, which arose independently in Cholan, Q'anjob'alan and Yucatecan.

## Main declarations

* `Mayan.MarkerSet`: Set A and Set B.
* `Mayan.ExponentTable`: a person-marker paradigm over the six person–number cells, with
  `Mayan.ExponentTable.IsThirdSgZero` for a null third person singular.
* `Mayan.VerbSlot`: the position classes of the verbal complex, and `Mayan.absPosition`, the
  `Mayan.ABSPosition` a verbal template determines.

## Implementation notes

A paradigm is an `Agreement.Paradigm` over `Agreement.Bundle.pnCells`, so a controller's
`Word.phi` indexes it directly ([corbett-1998]); an exponent is a list of `Morphology.Morph`,
empty for zero exponence and of length two for a discontinuous marker such as a person prefix
with a separate plural word. A cell whose only marker is a process also renders as `[]`. Tables
with pre-consonantal and pre-vocalic shapes are `Phonology.Segment.Class → ExponentTable`
functions. Each language's fragment carries its own tables, its verbal template and its case
function by aspect, so the position of the absolutive is read off the template rather than
recorded beside it; quantification over the family is a study's, in
`Studies/CoonMateoPedroPreminger2014.lean`.
