# Chol extraction marking

Chol (Cholan Mayan) has no Agent Focus form, so the extraction of no argument leaves a reflex on
the verb, and a question with two third-person arguments is ambiguous between subject and object
extraction. A recipient or benefactive is the primary object of the applicative *-be*,
cross-referenced by Set B, and Coon, Mateo Pedro and Preminger observe that either object of an
applicative verb extracts. These sources do not describe the extraction of adjuncts.

## Main declarations

* `Chol.Extraction.realize`: no reflex for the extraction of any argument, adjuncts unrecorded.

## References

* [coon-mateo-pedro-preminger-2014]
