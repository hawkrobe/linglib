# Tsotsil extraction marking

Tsotsil (Tseltalan Mayan) may put the verb in the Agent Focus form in *-on* when a transitive
subject is extracted; Aissen shows the form to be optional and governed by obviation, the form
of a clause whose object outranks its subject. A recipient or benefactive of a transitive verb
is always advanced to direct object by the applicative *-be*, so that it is cross-referenced by
Set B and extracts as the patient does. When an instrument, the object of the preposition *ta*,
is questioned, focused or relativized, the preposition drops and the enclitic *=ˀo* attaches to
the verb; a question with *k'u yu7un* 'why' takes no enclitic.

## Main declarations

* `Tsotsil.agentFocus`: the Agent Focus voice.
* `Tsotsil.Extraction.instrumentEnclitic`: the enclitic *=ˀo*.
* `Tsotsil.Extraction.realize`: the optional Agent Focus reflex of subject extraction, the
  enclitic of instrument extraction, and the unmarked extraction of the other arguments and of
  a reason.

## Implementation notes

The theme beside an applied recipient, a chômeur in Aissen's analysis, and the adjunct classes
other than instruments and reasons are unrecorded. A benefactive of an intransitive verb is an
oblique with the relational noun *-u7un*, so the benefactive cell depends on the verb and is
unrecorded too.
