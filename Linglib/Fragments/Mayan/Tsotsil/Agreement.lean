# Tsotsil agreement

Tsotsil marks person with two sets of affixes. Set A, the prefixes *j-*, *a-* and *s-*, before a
vowel *k-*, *av-* and *y-*, indexes the transitive subject and the possessor and marks person
only; a plural person adds a suffix, *-tik* for the inclusive first person and *-ik* for the
second and the third, the exclusive first person varying by dialect. Set B, which indexes the
intransitive subject and the transitive object, has two subsets: the suffixes *-on*, *-ot* and
zero, with the plurals *-otik*, *-oxuk* and *-ik*, and the prefixes *i-*, *a-* and zero, which
appear only after a verbal aspect prefix and never before the second person Set A, so *l-i-tal*
'I came' has the prefix and *tal-em-on* 'I have come' the suffix. The alignment is ergative in
every aspect. The verbal complex in citation order runs aspect, Set A, stem, Set B. The
extraction of a transitive subject may switch the verb to the Agent Focus form in *-on*, which
Aissen shows to be optional and governed by obviation, the form of a clause whose object
outranks its subject. Polian's sketch of Tseltal and Tsotsil, Aissen's clause-structure
monograph and her Agent Focus article are the sources.

## Main definitions

* `Tsotsil.setAExponent`, `Tsotsil.setAPlural`, `Tsotsil.setBExponent`,
  `Tsotsil.setBPrefixExponent`: the paradigms.
* `Tsotsil.template`, `Tsotsil.assignCase`: the verbal complex and the ergative case function.
* `Tsotsil.Extraction.realize`: the optional Agent Focus reflex of subject extraction.

## Implementation notes

The template records the citation order with Set B after the stem; the prefixal subset, whose
distribution is dialectally heterogeneous, is a second paradigm rather than a second template.
