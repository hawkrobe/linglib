# Chuj voice

Chuj (Q'anjob'alan Mayan) forms the stems of a transitive root with five suffixes, which
Coon tabulates: a null suffix for the transitive stem; *-w*, the incorporation antipassive,
whose object is a bare noun that takes no preposition, as in *ixintek'wi pelota* 'I
ball-kicked'; *-waj*, the absolutive antipassive, whose patient is an oblique introduced by
*t'a*, as in *ixintek'waj t'a nok' pelota* 'I did kicking to the ball'; *-j*, the agentless
passive, with no thematic agent, an *-u'uj*-phrase naming a cause of the event; and *-chaj*,
the passive, whose implicit agent may be expressed in an *-u'uj*-phrase and licenses
agent-oriented adverbs. Each stem is built from the root and its suffix, so the alternations
are read from the transitive construction. The decomposition of *-waj* and *-chaj* into *-w*
and *-ch* with a suffix *-aj* is Coon's analysis and lives in her study.

## Main definitions

* `Chuj.transitive`, `incorporationAntipassive`, `absolutiveAntipassive`,
  `agentlessPassive`, `passive` — the five stems of a transitive root as voices
* `Chuj.voices` — the inventory

## Main results

* `Chuj.agentFate` — the agent is kept by *-w* and *-waj*, demoted but present under
  *-chaj*, and absent under *-j*

## Implementation notes

The incorporated bare noun of a *-w* stem is entered as an implicit position, the frame
vocabulary having no expressed non-argument.
