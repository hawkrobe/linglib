# Malagasy relative clauses

Malagasy relativizes subjects only. The head noun is followed, optionally, by the invariable
relativizer *izay* and then by the clause with the relativized position left empty, as in *ny
mpianatra izay nahita ny vehivavy* 'the student that saw the woman'. Any other noun phrase must
first be promoted to subject by the voice system and then relativized as a subject. The data
are [keenan-comrie-1977]'s.
