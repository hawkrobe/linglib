# Gitksan modals

The modal system of Gitksan (Tsimshianic, ISO 639-3 `git`) as described in [matthewson-2013],
building on [peterson-2010]'s account of the epistemics. Every modal is specified for modality
type. The epistemic modals are the second-position clitics *ima('a)* and the reportative *g̱at*,
each compatible with contexts supporting possibility and necessity claims alike. The
circumstantial modals are clause-initial verbs and a predicative particle: *da'aḵhlxw*, general
circumstantial possibility; *anooḵ*, deontic possibility; and *sgi*, circumstantial (weak)
necessity.

| type           | subtype     | possibility   | (weak) necessity |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| circumstantial | plain       | *da'aḵhlxw*   | *sgi*            |
| circumstantial | deontic     | *anooḵ*       | *sgi*            |
| epistemic      | plain       | *ima('a)*     | *ima('a)*        |
| epistemic      | reportative | *g̱at*         | *g̱at*            |

## Implementation notes

* Forms follow [matthewson-2013] in the orthography of Hindle and Rigsby, with the underline
  marking a uvular written as a combining macron below and the glottal apostrophe as ASCII `'`.
* The library's circumstantial flavor covers the pure circumstantial, ability and teleological
  readings the paper distinguishes.
* *g̱at*'s reportative evidence requirement is not recorded: `ModalItem` has no information
  source, and the epistemic flavor covers both clitics.
