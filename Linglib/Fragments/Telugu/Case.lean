# Telugu case

Telugu marks four cases on the noun by suffix and the other relations by postposition. The
nominative is the bare stem and the genitive the oblique stem, neither with a suffix; the
accusative suffix is *-ni* and the dative *-ki*, each also heard with *-u* for *-i* except after
an *i*. The oblique stem carries the accusative and dative suffixes and the postpositions alike,
among them *lō* 'in' and *nunci* 'from' (`Telugu.Adpositions`). Krishnamurti and Gwynn count the
case suffixes among the postpositions that only occur bound to the stem (§§9.12–9.14), and Aitha
separates them, the postpositions standing outside the noun's prosodic word. The forms
are those of the paradigms of *illu* 'house' and *samudram* 'ocean' that Aitha reproduces from
Krishnamurti and Gwynn's grammar; the oblique stem is the matter of `Studies/Aitha2026.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `Telugu.Case`, `Telugu.Case.suffix`: the four cases, and the suffixes of the two that have one.
