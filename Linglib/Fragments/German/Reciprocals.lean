# German reciprocals

German marks reciprocity with the reciprocal pronoun *einander* and with *sich*, the form of the
third person reflexive. [gast-haas-2008] split *sich* into two lexical entries of one shape:
pronominal *sich*, a noun phrase that is only reflexive, and clitic *sich*, a middle marker that
is also reciprocal. Only clitic *sich* is reciprocal, so *sich* has no reciprocal reading where
only a noun phrase can stand, after a preposition, in the forefield, coordinated or stressed;
after a preposition *einander* is the only reciprocal (*an-einander*). On [siloni-2012]'s analysis
(footnotes 13 and 38), clitic *sich* marks a syntactically formed reciprocal verb, as Romance *se*
does: embedded under *sagen* 'say', a *sich* reciprocal lacks the "I" reading that *einander*
allows.
