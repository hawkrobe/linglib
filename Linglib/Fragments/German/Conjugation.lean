# German conjugation

This file defines the stem of a German verb, the forms its conjugation is built from, and the
rules that build them. A verb is weak or strong. A weak verb forms its past with *-te* and its past
participle with *-t* on its root, so that all its forms follow from the infinitive; a strong verb
changes the vowel of its root, and its forms have to be learnt. A root in *-d* or *-t*, or in *-m*
or *-n* after a consonant other than *l* or *r*, puts a linking *-e-* before these endings, as in
*arbeitet* and *zeichnete*. The past participle has the prefix *ge-* when the verb is stressed on
its first syllable, and so lacks it in the verbs in *-ieren* and in the verbs with an inseparable
prefix such as *be-*, *ver-* or *ent-*: *gratuliert*, *bezahlt*.

A separable verb conjugates like the simple verb it is formed from. Its particle stands at the end
of a main clause, *ruft … an*, and is joined to the non-finite forms, with the *ge-* of the simple
verb and the *zu* of the infinitive after it: *angerufen*, *anzurufen*. The present tense has the
endings *-e*, *-st*, *-t*, *-en*, *-t* and *-en* in weak and strong verbs alike. The rules and the
examples are Durrell's.

## Main definitions

* `German.Conjugation.Stem`: the infinitive, third person singular present and past, and past
  participle of a verb.
* `German.Conjugation.weak`, `German.Conjugation.strong`: the stem of a weak verb from its
  infinitive, and of a strong verb from its principal parts.
* `German.Conjugation.Stem.inseparable`, `German.Conjugation.Stem.separable`: the stem of a verb
  with an inseparable prefix or a separable particle.
* `German.Conjugation.weakPresent`: the present tense of a weak verb.

## Implementation notes

The rules read the spelling. A root in *-ier* is taken to be the suffix of the verbs in *-ieren*,
and an *h* after a vowel, as in *lohnen*, marks vowel length and is not a consonant. Irregular
weak verbs, the vowel changes of strong verbs in the present and the verbs stressed off their first
syllable for other reasons are not covered: their forms are given as those of a strong verb.
