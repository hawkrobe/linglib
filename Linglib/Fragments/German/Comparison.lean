# German comparison

This file defines the German comparative construction, *X ist größer als Y* 'X is bigger than Y'.
The standard of comparison follows the particle *als* and takes its case from the compared noun
phrase, and the adjective carries the comparative ending *-er* and the superlative ending *-st*
whatever its length: Durrell notes that *mehr* and *meist* form comparatives and superlatives only
in a few special cases. The construction is a particle comparative in the sense of Stassen's WALS
chapter on comparatives, whose sample does not include German, so its type is read off the
construction (`Comparative.type`).
