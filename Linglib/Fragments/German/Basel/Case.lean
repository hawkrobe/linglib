# Basel German case

This file defines the three cases of Basel German, nominative, accusative and dative, with the
forms of the definite article and of the stressed first person singular pronoun, following
Suter's grammar. The personal pronouns keep all three cases apart (§124). The article marks the
dative, but it never tells the accusative from the nominative, so that the accusative differs
from the nominative on nouns only by position in the clause (§82). The genitive has long vanished
as a case (§91), and the possessor is a dative, with a possessive pronoun or after *vo* (§193).

## Main declarations

* `German.Basel.Case`: the three cases.
* `German.Basel.article`, `German.Basel.pronoun`: the forms of the definite article in each gender
  and number (§83), and of the stressed first person singular pronoun (§125).
* `article_nom_eq_acc`, `article_dat_ne_nom`, `pronoun_injective`: the article marks the dative
  but not the accusative, and the pronoun marks both.

## Implementation notes

A cell holds all the forms Suter gives for it: the article *d* beside its full form *die*, and
the stressed *yy* beside *yych*. The genitive article *s* of names for a whole family,
*s Waagners* 'the Wagner family' (§83), and the forms *am* and *im* heard beside the dative *em*
(§85) are left out.
