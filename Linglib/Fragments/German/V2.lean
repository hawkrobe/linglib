# German verb second

This file records where the finite verb of German moves to the left periphery, as a
distribution over sentence types and embedding contexts. German is verb second in root
declaratives, wh-questions and yes/no-questions, and in an embedded declarative without a
complementizer, *Sie sagte, sie würde kommen*, where the verb fills the position the
complementizer *dass* otherwise occupies; with the complementizer the clause is verb final, as
are embedded questions. The yes/no-question setting records verb fronting that surfaces as V1,
with an empty specifier. Exclamatives and imperatives are not verb second. A subordinate form
used as a root utterance keeps the verb last: the *dass*-clause in isolation that Durrell
records as a command, wish or exclamation, and the deliberative *ob*- or wh-question of
Gutzmann's minimal pairs.
