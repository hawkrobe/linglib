# German modal particles

This file defines the German modal particles *ja*, *denn*, *wohl*, *halt* and *doch* and the
combination *doch wohl* as `Particle` entries, each with the sentence types of a main clause in
which Durrell describes it. A modal particle stands in the middle of the clause and adds the
speaker's attitude to what is said. *Ja* appeals for agreement in statements, expresses surprise
in exclamations and intensifies a command, often as a warning and especially when stressed.
*Denn* is used in questions only, polar and constituent questions alike. *Wohl* signals
probability in statements and uncertainty in questions. *Halt* occurs in statements and
commands. *Doch* marks disagreement in statements, urgency in commands, a request for
confirmation in constituent questions and surprise in exclamations; unstressed, it can turn a
statement into a question expecting the answer yes, and with *wohl* it hopes that something is
the case. A sentence type the grammar says nothing about is left unrecorded.

The response particles *ja*, *nein* and *doch* are in `German.PolarityMarking`, and the analyses
of the modal particles are with the studies of them: Gutzmann's typing of *ja*, *denn* and *wohl*
with his own examples, Theiler's *denn*, Seeliger and Repp's *doch wohl*.
