# Zürich German verbs

This file defines the case-governing verbs of Shieber's Swiss German subordinate clauses, whose
informants spoke the Zürich dialect. Each entry is the root `Verb` with its case array and the
inflected forms the clauses attest: *hälfe* 'help' takes a dative object, and *laa* 'let' and
*aastriiche* 'paint' take an accusative one.

## Implementation notes

An entry records its object's case and no complement frame. Whether the accusative of *laa* is
its own object or the subject of the infinitive it embeds is a question of structure that Shieber
leaves open.
