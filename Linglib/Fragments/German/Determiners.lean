# German determiners

This file defines the declensions of the German determiners and the German determiner inventory.
A determiner declines for the case, number and gender of its noun, and its forms are the main way
these categories are shown. A paradigm has sixteen cells, the four cases in each of the three
genders of the singular and in the plural, where the genders fall together. Many determiners take
one set of endings, the strong endings of *dieser* 'this'. The indefinite article *ein*, its
negative *kein* and the possessives take them too, except in the nominative singular masculine and
the nominative and accusative singular neuter, where they have none, and *ein* has no plural. The
definite article *der* has forms of its own. The paradigms are Durrell's.

No paradigm distinguishes all sixteen cells. The definite article keeps the four cases apart in
the masculine singular only: the nominative and the accusative fall together in the other genders
and in the plural, and the genitive and the dative in the feminine singular. In the singular it
keeps the three genders apart in the nominative and the accusative but not in the genitive and the
dative, and that is the agreement evidence for the three-gender carrier of `German.Gender`.

The definite article contracts with some prepositions, *im* for *in dem* and *zur* for *zu der*.
Durrell notes that the full form is used where the article is stressed, refers back to something
just mentioned or has the force of a demonstrative, as in *Er ging zu der Hütte* 'he went to the
hut (just mentioned)' against *Er ging zur Hütte* 'he went to the hut (we all know)'. Schwarz takes
the contracted and the full form for a weak article of uniqueness and a strong article of
familiarity, and Moroney classes a language by how its articles mark the two.

## Main declarations

* `German.Determiners.GenderNumber`: the gender and number a determiner agrees in.
* `German.Determiners.strongEnding`: the strong endings.
* `German.Determiners.dieser`, `German.Determiners.einWord`, `German.Determiners.kein`,
  `German.Determiners.ein`, `German.Determiners.definite`: the declensions.
* `German.Determiners.Endingless`: the three cells where *ein* and *kein* have no ending.
* `German.Determiners.injective_definite_sg_masc`, `German.Determiners.definite_nom_eq_acc_iff`,
  `German.Determiners.definite_gen_eq_dat_iff`: the case syncretisms of the definite article.
* `German.Determiners.faithful`: the three-gender carrier is faithful to the definite article.
* `German.Determiners.inventory`, `German.Determiners.marking`: the inventory and its cell in
  Moroney's typology.
