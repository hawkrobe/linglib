# Korean converbs

Korean chains clauses with conjunctive suffixes, Sohn's term for its converbs, on the nonfinite
verb of each medial clause before a single final verb, without switch-reference. The nonfinite
verb keeps its voice, subject-honorific and tense slots but takes no sentence ender. *-go*
'and' coordinates, *-go(seo)*, *-eoseo*, *-jamaja* and *-daga* sequence events, *-myeonseo*
'while' marks simultaneity, *-eoseo*, *-(eu)ni* and *-(eu)nikka* give the reason,
*-(eu)myeon* 'if' conditions, *-jiman*, *-(eu)na* and *-eodo* concede, *-dorok* gives a
result or limit, *-(eu)ryeogo* and *-(eu)reo* the purpose, *-neunde* background, and *-geona*
and *-deunji* 'or' disjoin. Tense before a suffix is relative to the final verb; some suffixes
admit the past *-eoss* and the modal *-gess* before them and others exclude both. The negative
adverbs and the negative verb occur in a medial clause, governed by the sentence type of the
final clause. Forms are in the Revised Romanization; Sohn writes *-ko*, *-e(se)*,
*-(u)myense*, *-(u)nikka*, *-ciman*, *-tolok*, *-(u)lyeko*, *-taka*, *-ca(maca)*, *-kena*.

## Implementation notes

* `AllowsTense` and `AllowsModal` follow the features Sohn attaches to each conjunctor and,
  for *-geona*, *-deunji* and *-jamaja*, which his list omits, the attachment statements of
  the National Institute of Korean Language's dictionary; Sohn marks *-tunci* as excluding
  the modal, which the dictionary admits in one of its senses.
* The clause-chaining typology over the converbs is in `Studies/SarvasyAikhenvald2025.lean`.
