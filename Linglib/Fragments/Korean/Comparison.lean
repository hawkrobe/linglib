# Korean comparison

Korean has no adjectival affix like English *-er*. Comparison is made with the particle *-boda*
'than' after the noun phrase compared with, of separative origin, and the adjective in its bare
form, *Yongho-ga Minca-boda keu-da* 'Yongho is taller than Minca', with the adverb *deo* 'more'
as an optional intensifier and the standard and the compared phrase free to scramble, as Sohn
describes it. It is a separative comparative in Stassen's typology, and the superlative is the
comparative with a universal standard. Sohn writes *pota* and *te*.
