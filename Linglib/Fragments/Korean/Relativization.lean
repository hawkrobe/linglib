# Korean relative clauses

Korean has no relative pronoun and no complementizer. A relative clause precedes its head noun
and its verb carries an adnominal suffix, *-(n)ɨn* in the present, *-n* in the past and *-l* in
the prospective; the relativized position is dropped together with its case marker, and this
strategy relativizes subjects, direct objects, indirect objects and obliques. A genitive cannot
be dropped: the possessive pronoun is retained, as in *chaki-ij lä-ka chongmyəngha-n kɨ salam*
'the man whose dog is smart', literally 'his dog is smart, the man'. The data are
[keenan-comrie-1977]'s.
