# Korean polarity items

Korean builds its indefinites on the interrogative pronouns, as Japanese does: bare *nwukwu*
'who' is an indefinite in questions and conditionals; *nwukwu-to*, with the additive particle
*-to*, is the negative indefinite of *nwukwu-to an wass-ta* 'nobody came', which needs
clausemate negation, the counterpart of Japanese *dare-mo*; and *nwukwu-na*, whose *-na* is
the adversative mood of the copula and also means 'or', is the free-choice item of
*nwukwu-na hal su issta* 'anyone can do it'.

## Main results

* `Korean.PolarityItems.nwukwuTo_licensing_characterized`,
  `Korean.PolarityItems.korean_licensing_sound` — the predicted and attested licensing
  environments of the items agree
