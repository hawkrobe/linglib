# Shawi

Shawi (Chayahuita; Kawapanan, Peru) inflects the verb for the person and number of both the
subject and the object, on a minimal/augmented number system with a clusivity contrast in the
first person, and marks some transitive subjects with the ergative suffix *-ri* while objects
stay unmarked. The agreement tables are those of [clem-deal-2024], compiled from [hart-1988],
[barraza-de-garcia-2005] and Ulloa's corpus work; the ergative data are [bourdeau-2015]'s.

## Main definitions

* `subjectMarker`: the indicative subject agreement suffix of a person–number cell.
* `objectMarker`: the object agreement suffix of a cell; third person has none.
* `caseInventory`, `caseMarker`: the two morphological cases and their exponents.

## Implementation notes

Clusivity is a person value (`Person.firstInclusive`, `Person.firstExclusive`), and the
clusivity-neutral `Person.first` is not a cell of the paradigms. Number is `Number.minimal` and
`Number.augmented`, so first inclusive minimal is the speaker–addressee dyad. The glottal stop is
written `'`, and a segment in parentheses varies across the sources. A null exponent and an
absent cell are both `none`.
