# Norwegian conjugation

This file defines the stem of a Bokmål verb and builds it from the infinitive by the weak
classes of Faarlund, Lie and Vannebo's reference grammar. A stem is the infinitive, the present,
the preterite and the past participle. The present of every weak verb is the infinitive with
*-r*: *-er* on the root of an infinitive in *-e*, *-r* on a stem in a stressed vowel. The classes
differ in the preterite and the participle, and the grammar draws the line between them there.
A weak verb of the first class, the largest and the productive one, has one form for both,
*-et* on the root, *kaste*, *kastet*, *kastet*, with *-a* as a rarer written variant. A weak verb
of the second class has a dental in both, and the dental of the participle is that of the
preterite: *-te* and *-t* after most stems, *reiste*, *reist*, *-de* and *-d* after a stem in a
voiced *-d*, *-g* or *-v* or in the diphthongs *-ei* and *-øy*, *levde*, *levd*, and *-dde* and
*-dd* after a stem in a single stressed vowel, *rodde*, *rodd*. A double consonant at the end of
the stem is written single before the dental endings, *kjenne*, *kjente*, *bygge*, *bygde*. A
strong verb, or a weak verb with a vowel change such as *sette*, *satte*, *satt*, is given by
its four forms.

## Main definitions

* `Norwegian.Conjugation.Stem`: the infinitive, present, preterite and past participle.
* `Norwegian.Conjugation.weak1`, `dental`, `weak2a`, `weak2b`, `weak2c`: the stem of a weak
  verb of each class, from its infinitive.

## Main results

* `Norwegian.Conjugation.weak1_preterite_eq_participle`, `dental_preterite`,
  `weak2c_preterite`: the first class has one form for the preterite and the participle, and the
  second class the participle with *-e*.
* `Norwegian.Conjugation.weak1_present`, `dental_present`: the present is *-er* on the root.

## Implementation notes

The rules read the spelling. The *-a* variant of the first class and the Nynorsk classes are not
covered, and a verb whose stressed vowel is *e*, as *kle*, is a second-class verb in *-dde* by
`weak2c`, which does not take the final *-e* for an infinitive ending.
