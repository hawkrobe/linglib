# Norwegian verbs

This file defines the Bokmål verb as a lexical entry, the root `Verb` with its stem and its
formation, simplex or a verb phrase with a verbal particle. Faarlund, Lie and Vannebo's reference
grammar calls a preposition without a complement that goes with a verb a verbal particle, *kaste
bort* 'throw away', and describes the relation of such a verb phrase to the compound verb with
the same particle as its first member, *bortkaste*. The past participle takes the compound form
more readily than the other forms, and where the verb is otherwise a verb phrase the compound
participle is used attributively, *en oppgjort sak*, and after *være* and *bli*, *Saka er
oppgjort* 'the matter is settled', while after *ha* and *få* the participle stays a verb phrase,
*Vi har gjort opp saka* 'we have settled the matter'. The entries are the particle verbs whose
participles the grammar lists and those of den Dikken's Norwegian examples, with the simplex
verbs they are formed on, conjugated by the grammar's classes.

## Main definitions

* `Norwegian.Verb`: the entry, the root `Verb` with its stem and its formation.
* `Norwegian.ParticipleContext`, `Norwegian.ParticipleContext.IsCompound`: where a participle
  stands, and the contexts that take the compound form.
* `Norwegian.Verb.phraseParticiple`, `Norwegian.Verb.compoundParticiple`,
  `Norwegian.Verb.participle`: the participle of the verb phrase, the compound participle, and
  the one a context takes.
* `Norwegian.Verb.transitive`, `Norwegian.Verb.withParticle`: the transitive entry of a stem,
  and the verb phrase formed on an entry with a verbal particle.
* `Norwegian.Verbs.allVerbs`: the entries.

## Main results

* `Norwegian.Verb.participle_eq_compoundParticiple`, `participle_of_simplex`: the contexts that
  take the compound participle, and a simplex verb's one participle.
* `Norwegian.Verbs.grammar_compound_participles`, `Norwegian.Verbs.gjoereOpp_participle`: the
  compound participles the grammar lists come out of the rule, and *gjøre opp* has the grammar's
  two participles.

## Implementation notes

The entries are Bokmål with the *-et* forms of the first weak class; den Dikken's examples are
Nynorsk, *sparka*, *klipt*, and are recorded as rows of his study. Which verb phrases also exist
as compound verbs in all their forms, the grammar's three groups, is not recorded.
