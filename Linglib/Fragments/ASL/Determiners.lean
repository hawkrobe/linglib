# ASL quantifier signs

This file records the quantificational signs of American Sign Language attested with locus and
height modification in [davidson-gagne-2022], under their ASL Signbank ID glosses, as the
carrier `Sign`. A sign projects to a `Quantifier` record and denotes the readings the
literature makes available for its gloss: `FS(ALL)` is the fingerspelled universal, `ALL-b` its
two-handed form, `NONEsym` the symmetrical negative quantifier, and the numerals `ONE` and `TWO`
carry both the at-least and the exactly reading. Which signs carry a height-marked locus
themselves and which take a following `IX-arc` is a matter of their phonological form and is
classified in the study, not here.
