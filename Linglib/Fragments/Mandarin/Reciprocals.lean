# Mandarin reciprocals

Mandarin can express reciprocity by compounding a verb with *lái* 'come' and *qù* 'go' in the
pattern V-*lái*-V-*qù*: *Tāmen dǎ-lái-dǎ-qù* 'They beat each other', [konig-kokutani-2006]'s example
as [nordlinger-2023] cites it. König and Kokutani class it as a compound verbal strategy, and
[nordlinger-2023] notes that [evans-2008]'s typology places it among the multiclausal strategies, as
verb compounding with a repeated one-way predicate. The adverb *hùxiāng* 互相 'mutually' also marks
reciprocity; adverbs are outside the strategy vocabulary of `Reciprocal.Strategy`.
