# Mandarin relative clauses

Mandarin relative clauses precede their head and end in the particle *de*. The relativized
position may be left empty, which relativizes subjects and direct objects, or filled by a
personal pronoun, which relativizes everything from direct objects down to objects of
comparison; the two overlap at direct objects, where retention is optional. Mandarin is the
sample's only prenominal-clause language whose pronoun-retention strategy reaches the bottom of
the hierarchy. The data are [keenan-comrie-1977]'s, whose Table 1 lists the language as
Chinese (spoken Pekingese).
