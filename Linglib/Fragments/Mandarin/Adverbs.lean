# Mandarin adverbs

The Mandarin adverbs that trigger presuppositions. *Yě*, *yòu*, *zài* and *jiù* are among the
nonmovable adverbs of Li and Thompson's grammar, which occur only after the subject or topic and
before the verb. *Yě* 也 'also' applies to the subject: *tā yě mǎi-le yi-ge huāpíng* 's/he, in
addition to some other people, also bought a vase'. The two adverbs meaning 'again' divide the
time line between them: *yòu* 又 applies to past and present events, as in *tā zuótiān yòu chī
le* 's/he ate again yesterday', and *zài* 再 to events that have not yet happened, as in *tā
míngtiān zài chī* 's/he'll eat again tomorrow' and in commands, and neither occurs in the
other's domain. *Jiù* 就 has several uses, among them 'immediately', 'then' and an emphatic one;
the entry here is its use as 'only', in which it associates with a focus to its right. *Réng* 仍
'still' presents a state as continuing from the past, and *búzài* 不再 'no longer', built from
the negator *bù* and *zài*, is its counterpart for a state that has ended; neither combines with
a telic predicate. *Fǎn'ér* 反而 'instead' asserts its clause against a salient alternative that
is false, where *yě* requires one that is true. The description follows Li and Thompson for
*yě*, *yòu*, *zài* and *jiù*, and Wang for the focus association of *jiù* and for *réng*,
*búzài* and *fǎn'ér*. The presuppositional verbs *zhīdào* 'know', *hòuhuǐ* 'regret' and *kāishǐ*
'start' are entries of `Fragments/Mandarin/Predicates.lean`.
