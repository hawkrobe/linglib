# Mandarin negation

Mandarin negates a declarative verbal clause with one of two preverbal negators, chosen by
aspect. *Bù* negates non-perfective predicates, present and future, is the natural choice with
states, and adds nothing else to the clause: *Nézha bù tǎoyàn Yángjiǎn* 'Nezha does not hate
Yangjian'. *Méi* negates perfective and experiential predicates and is the dedicated negator of
the existential and possessive verb *yǒu* 'have', which may follow it in the long form
*méi-yǒu*. The perfective particle *le* does not occur under it, while the experiential *guò*
does: *Nézha chuī le chángdí* 'Nezha played the flute' is negated as *Nézha méi-yǒu chuī
chángdí*. Prohibitions use neither negator but the negative imperatives *bié* and *búyào*,
literally 'not want'. The description follows [miestamo-2005], [zhao-2025] and [jin-koenig-2021]; [miestamo-2005]'s
classification of the constructions as symmetric and asymmetric lives in
`Studies/Miestamo2005.lean`, and the negators that appear expletively under *fear* and *regret*
are the rows of `Data.Examples.JinKoenig2021`.
