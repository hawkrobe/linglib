# Mandarin comparison

This file defines the Mandarin comparative of superiority, *tā bǐ nǐ gāo* 'she is taller than
you': the compared item, *bǐ* 'compare with' followed by the standard, and the predicate naming
the dimension. The standard is the object of *bǐ*, a role the construction fixes rather than one
copied from the compared item, so the construction is an exceed comparative (`Comparative.type`). The comparatives of inferiority, with
*méi(yǒu)* or *bùrú*, and of equality, with *gēn … yíyàng*, have the same shape, and the
superlative is the adverb *zuì* 'most' before the predicate.
