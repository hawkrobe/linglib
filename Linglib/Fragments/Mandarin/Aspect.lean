# Mandarin aspect markers

Mandarin has no tense inflection, and temporal interpretation rests largely on a small set of
aspect particles. The verbal suffix *le* is commonly described as the perfective marker and
*guò* as the experiential marker, an experiential perfect; the preverbal *zài* marks the
progressive. *Nézha chuī le chángdí* 'Nezha played the flute' typically refers to a specific,
likely recent event, while *Nézha chuī guò chángdí* 'Nezha has played the flute before' reports
that such an experience exists. The negative counterpart of *le* is the negator *méi-yǒu*,
entered in `Fragments/Mandarin/Negation.lean`. The description and examples follow
[zhao-2025], who also documents the use of *le* and *guò* in comparatives; that the two uses
share one meaning is the dissertation's analysis and lives in `Studies/Zhao2025.lean`.
