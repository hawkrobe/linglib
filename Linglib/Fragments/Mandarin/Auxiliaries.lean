# Mandarin auxiliary verbs

This file defines the commonly used Mandarin auxiliary verbs of Li and Thompson's list:
*yīnggāi*, *yīngdāng* and *gāi* 'ought to, should'; *néng*, *nénggòu*, *huì* and *kěyǐ* 'be able
to'; *néng* and *kěyǐ* 'have permission to'; *gǎn* 'dare'; *kěn* 'be willing to'; *děi*, *bìxū*,
*bìyào* and *bìděi* 'must, ought to'; and *huì* 'will, know how'. An auxiliary, like a verb, can
be the A of an A-not-A question and can answer a question on its own, as in *wǒ néng* 'I can';
adverbs such as *yídìng* 'definitely' and *dàgài* 'approximately' can do neither.

## Implementation notes

The senses are read as flavors in the usual way: ability as circumstantial, and permission and
obligation as deontic. 'Ought to, should' is weak necessity, and the group glossed 'must, ought
to' is entered with necessity, the stronger of its two glosses. Senses that are not flavors are
left out: the future *huì* 'will', and the daring and willingness of *gǎn* and *kěn*, which are
auxiliaries without modality.
