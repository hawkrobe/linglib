# Ancient Greek case

Ancient Greek has five cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive and dative. Its dative
does not correspond closely to the Latin dative. Greek has no ablative, and of the functions of
the Latin ablative the genitive expresses source, while the dative expresses location and
instrument beside the indirect object, so that the Greek dative is the more comprehensive case.
Blake gives the system, vocative aside, as the four-case stage of his hierarchy.

## Main declarations

* `Greek.Ancient.Case`: the five cases.
* `Greek.Ancient.Case.label`, `Greek.Ancient.Case.functions`: the comparative value each case is
  named for, and the values it expresses.
