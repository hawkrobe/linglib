# Greek temporal connectives

Lexical entries for the Modern Greek temporal connectives: *prin* 'before', whose complement is a
*na*-subjunctive, *afou* 'after' and *otan* 'when' with indicative complements, and *mexri*
'until'. Giannakidou takes *mexri* for Karttunen's durative *until* and the polarity item *para
monon*, literally 'but only', for the punctual one, so that Greek lexicalizes the two *until*s
apart; Iatridou and Zeijlstra read *para monon* as an exceptive and note that *mexri* also takes
perfectives. Each classification lives in its paper's study.
