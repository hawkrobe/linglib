# Taos verbal agreement prefixes

The Taos (Kiowa-Tanoan, Northern Tiwa) verb carries a prefix that agrees with up to three
arguments, the agent, the goal and the object, linearized in that order ([watkins-1984]).
Persons are first, second and third; the agreement categories are singular, dual, plural and
inverse (`Number.Inverse.Category`), the last being what a D head shows when its inherent and
natural number value one feature both ways ([harbour-2011]). Objects in the paradigm are third
person, the dummy object *no*, or a reflexive. The complete paradigm is Table 3 of the online
appendix to [middleton-2026], from [kontak-kunkel-1987] as corroborated by [harrington-1916],
transcribed here cell by cell; `form` looks a cell up.

## Main declarations

* `Taos.Cell`, `Taos.prefixes`, `Taos.form`: the paradigm and its lookup.
* `Taos.classI` to `Taos.classIV`: the four noun classes by inherent number, with the agreement
  category each shows for each natural number (`Taos.classI_category` and kin, the appendix's
  Table 21).

## Implementation notes

* Forms are given as the appendix prints them, with acute for high tone, circumflex for
  falling tone and an ogonek for nasalization; ∅ is the empty string. A cell with two free
  variants (*ku* ~ *mây*) has two rows, and `form` returns the first.
* The appendix's Table 3 lists reflexive objects for the one-argument prefixes only; the
  reflexives of possessive and ditransitive prefixes appear in its Table 16 and are not
  transcribed here.
* Rows whose label spans several numbers in the source (a bare person, or *1s/d*) are
  expanded to one row per cell; the cells two such labels both cover (*1 3i* and *1i 3*,
  *3 3i* and *3i 3*) appear once.
