# Lakhota determiner inventory

Lakhota (Siouan, ISO `lkt`) has two overt definite articles: the general
*kiŋ*, with both situational and anaphoric uses, and *k'uŋ* 'the
above-mentioned', restricted to previously-mentioned referents and far
rarer ([latrouite-van-valin-2014]; [ingham-2003b] §15.1 has *ki* "for new
or previously mentioned items without distinction" and *k'uŋ* as an
infrequent switch back to an earlier topic — endorsing [curl-1999]'s
topic-marking account — or an emphatic marker of 'enforced reality').
Because *kiŋ* covers anaphora, the inventory derives `.generallyMarked`;
the `.bipartite` cell follows only under [schwarz-2013] §4.2.1's tentative
weak/strong construal of the pair, disputed also by [ingham-2003] (the
element is basically a topic marker) and [ogorman-2011] (accessibility).
Covarying (donkey) uses are unreported for either article. The singular
specific (realis) indefinite article is *waŋ*, opposed to non-specific
*waŋži* ([rood-taylor-1996] Table 3; [latrouite-van-valin-2014] Table 1;
[ingham-2003b] §15.1.4); the non-specific, negative, and plural series
are not typed here.
