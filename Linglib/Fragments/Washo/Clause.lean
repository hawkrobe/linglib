# Washo clausal embedding

Washo (Hokan/isolate, ISO 639-3 `was`) has two ways of embedding a clause under a verb. A
verb of knowledge or perception such as *hamup'ay* 'forget' or *i:gi* 'see' takes a nominalized
clause: the clause stays in the independent mood *-i* and closes with the nominalizer
*-gi ~ -ge*, the exponent of Hanink's index head. A verb of thought or speech such as *hamu*
'think' or *i:d* 'say' is intransitive, and the clause it embeds is bare, in the dependent mood
*-aʔ*. The two classes differ in transitivity, which each verb's frames record: 'know' and 'see'
also take plain DP objects, while 'think' is questioned with *how* rather than *what*, and
'dream' embeds a bare clause only with the reflexive prefix *gum-*. 'Know', 'remember' and
'believe' are inherently negative, so their positive reading carries the negative suffix
*-e:s*, and 'remember' is negated 'forget'.

Forms follow Jacobsen's orthography: `:` marks vowel length, ʔ ɨ ŋ are IPA, and stress is
acute. The data are Bochnak and Hanink's; their analysis of the split as complementation
against modification is `Studies/BochnakHanink2021.lean`.
