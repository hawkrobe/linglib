# Hausa tone

Hausa has three surface tones: high, unmarked in the orthography (*shā* 'drink'), low, marked by
a grave accent (*dà* 'with, and'), and falling, marked by a circumflex (*tî* 'tea'). A fall is a
high and a low on one syllable, and occurs only on a heavy syllable. There is no rising tone: a
low-high sequence that arises on one syllable, as when a vowel is lost, simplifies to low after a
high in the same word and to high elsewhere, so *gawàyī* 'charcoal' shortens to *gawài* and
*tàusàyī* 'pity' to *tàusái* ([newman-2000]).

The definite article is *-n*, or *-r̃* after a feminine singular noun in *-a*, preceded by a
floating low tone. The low turns a final high into a fall, *bàkā* 'bow' and *bàkân* 'the bow',
and attaches vacuously after a low or a fall, *watà* 'month' and *watàn* 'the month'. A few
morphemes have polar tone, the opposite of an adjacent tone: the stabilizer *nē* / *cē* takes the
opposite of the preceding syllable, the possessive markers *nā* / *tā* the opposite of a
following pronoun, and the weak subject pronouns of the light paradigm the opposite of the
adjacent TAM marker. Tone-integrating suffixes give the whole word their melody, as the class 1
plural *-ōCī*, with a copy of the base-final consonant, makes every tone high: *gyàlè* 'shawl',
*gyalōlī* 'shawls'.

## Main definitions

* `Hausa.syllableTones` — the three surface tones as melodies on one syllable
* `Hausa.simplifyRising`, `Hausa.simplifyRisingWord` — the two rules removing a rise
* `Hausa.dockLow` — the floating low of the definite article on a word's final syllable
* `Hausa.polarOf`, `Hausa.polarAfter` — polar tone, and the polar tone after a syllable
* `Hausa.pluralOCi` — the class 1 plural as a replacive-dominant grammatical tone

## Main results

* `Hausa.simplifyRisingWord_mem` — the rules leave every syllable with a surface tone
* `Hausa.dockLow_mem`, `Hausa.getLast?_dockLow` — the definite article creates no new tone and
  leaves the word ending low
* `Hausa.polarAfter_fall` — a polar tone after a fall is high, as after a low, which follows from
  analysing the fall as a high and a low

## Implementation notes

A syllable's tones are its melody, a list of tonal root nodes, so that the fall is `[H, L]` and a
word is a list of syllable melodies. The polar morphemes and the article are lexical items of
other files; their tone is computed here from their host.
