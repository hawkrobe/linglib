# Hausa focus and the stabilizer

Hausa focuses a constituent by fronting it to a focus slot at the beginning of its clause,
where the stabilizer may follow it: *Hàdīzà cē ta ci lambā̀* 'It was Hadiza who won the prize'.
The clause after a fronted focus is a Rel environment, so its TAM must be a Rel form: *Audù nē ya
tàfi kā̀suwā* 'It is Audu who went to the market', with the preterite, against *Audù yā tàfi
kā̀suwā* 'Audu has gone to the market', with the completive ([newman-2000]). A focus may also stay
in place, with the TAM of a general clause and no marking of any kind; the particle rarely
follows it then, at the end of the clause or before an adjunct: *Audù yaa sàyi zoobèe ne* 'Audu
bought a RING' ([hartmann-zimmermann-2007-exhaustivity]).

The stabilizer has polar tone and no agreement feature but gender: it is *cē* after a feminine
singular and *nē* after anything else, a masculine, a plural, feminine coordinations included, a
prepositional phrase or a verb phrase. It can always be left out, and
[hartmann-zimmermann-2007-exhaustivity] argue that it marks not focus but exhaustivity, being
excluded where a property is known to hold of more than the focus.

## Main definitions

* `Hausa.ne`, `Hausa.ce`, `Hausa.stabilizer` — the stabilizer and its agreement
* `Hausa.FocusConfig` — a focused clause: its TAM, the TAM its PAC surfaces in, the PAC's subject
  cell, the focus strategy, and the focus's agreement features
* `Hausa.FocusConfig.Licensed` — a fronted focus takes a Rel counterpart of the clause's TAM, a
  focus in place a general TAM unchanged

## Main results

* `Hausa.FocusConfig.pacTAM_ne_iff` — a licensed focus changes the TAM exactly when it is fronted
  and the TAM does not occur in Rel environments, so fronting is audible in the PAC with the
  completive, the continuous and the potential and nowhere else
