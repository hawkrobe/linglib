# Hausa gender

Hausa has two genders, masculine and feminine, operative only in the singular: *yārò* 'boy' is
masculine and *yārinyā̀* 'girl' feminine, while the plural *yârā* 'children' has no gender. Nouns
for people and large animals take the gender of the referent's sex; for the rest gender is
lexically specific, *turmī* 'mortar' masculine and *wuƙā* 'knife' feminine.

Most native feminine nouns end in *-ā*, as *rìgā* 'gown', but the ending does not assign gender.
Some hundred feminines end otherwise, among them the old native word *màcè* 'woman', and over 250
of some 3,000 masculine nouns end in *-ā*: native stems such as *kadā̀* 'crocodile' and *ùbā*
'father', loanwords, and erstwhile plurals such as *gidā* 'house'. The correlation is historical:
feminine nouns acquired the ending by overt characterization, the addition of the feminine suffix
{-ā} to words that were already feminine ([newman-2000]).
