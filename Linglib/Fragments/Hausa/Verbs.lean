# Hausa verbs

Hausa verbs fall into morphological classes called grades, each defined by a tone pattern and a
termination, a final vowel or in a few grades a final *-aC*: *dafā̀* 'cook' is grade 1, *zā̀gā*
'insult' grade 2, *kōmō* 'return here' grade 6. A verb base operates in several grades, as *sàyā*
'buy' (grade 2) appears as *sayḕ* 'buy up' (grade 4), *sayar̃* 'sell' (grade 5), *sayō* 'buy and
bring' (grade 6) and *sàyu* 'be well bought' (grade 7). Within its grade a verb has up to four
forms by syntactic context: the A-form with no object after it, the B-form before a personal
pronoun direct object, the C-form before any other direct object, and the D-form before an
indirect object, where grades 2, 3 and 7 have no form of their own and add the pre-dative suffix
instead. Grades 0 to 3 are primary; grade 3 is exclusively intransitive and grade 2 exclusively
transitive. The secondary grades carry meanings: grade 4 action totally done, grade 5, the
efferential, action directed away from the speaker, grade 6, the ventive, action toward the
speaker, and grade 7, the sustentative, an agentless passive or middle ([newman-2000]).

## Main definitions

* `Hausa.Grade`, `Hausa.Grade.terminations`, `Hausa.Grade.melody` — the grades and their
  terminations and tones by form
* `Hausa.Grade.HasObjectForms`, `Hausa.Grade.UsesPreDative` — a grade has forms before a direct
  object; it adds the pre-dative suffix before an indirect object
* `Hausa.Verb` — a verb with its grade

## Main results

* `Hausa.Grade.usesPreDative_iff` — the grades that add the pre-dative suffix are grade 2 and the
  grades with no form before a direct object
* `Hausa.Grade.changing_iff` — grade 2 is the one grade whose A-, B- and C-forms all differ
* `Hausa.Verb.isIntransitive_of_not_hasObjectForms` — the entries of a grade with no form before a
  direct object are intransitive

## Implementation notes

The terminations and tones are those of [newman-2000]'s table of the grade system, for finite
verbs outside the imperative. A grade's melody is its tone pattern on a verb of two syllables,
spreading from the right, so that a lone high covers every syllable; the tone of a third syllable,
which differs between forms in grades 1, 2 and 4, is not recorded. The particle *dà* that follows
some grade 5 forms is not part of the verb and is left out, and the grade 5 form with no
termination is written *-Ø*.
