# Jarawara possessed nouns

This file records the genders of Jarawara (Arawan, Brazil), its possessors, and its possessed
nouns, after Dixon.

Jarawara has two genders, masculine and feminine, the feminine being unmarked. About 175 nouns,
among them body parts, parts of wholes and places, are possessed by placing the possessor directly
before them. Many of them have two forms, which Dixon calls the f form and the m form: the m form
goes with a first or second person possessor and with a masculine singular one, and the f form
with a feminine singular possessor and with a third person nonsingular one. The first and second
person singular possessors are prefixes, the other pronouns separate words, and a third person
singular pronoun is unpronounced. A possessed noun used without a possessor is feminine, with the
one exception of *atiwa* 'thorn'.

## Implementation notes

* A possessed noun with a single form has the same f and m form.
* A few possessed nouns, *isi/iso* 'leg' among them, take the first and second person singular
  prefixes on the f form; `PossessedNoun.form` gives the general rule.
