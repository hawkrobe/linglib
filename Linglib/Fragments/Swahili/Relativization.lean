# Swahili relativization

This file defines the Swahili *amba* relative clause and its resumptive pronouns as Scott
describes them. The head precedes the complementizer *amba*, which takes the relative concord
of the head's class, *vi-azi amba-vyo u-li-vi-menya* 'the potatoes that you peeled'. A
relativized subject or direct object leaves a gap, with subject and object agreement obligatory
on the verb, and no pronoun may fill it. The object of a monosyllabic preposition or
connective, *na* 'with', *ya* 'of' or *mwa* 'in', is instead resumed by a pronoun suffixed to
it, since a stranded monosyllable would fall below the two-unit minimal word; a trisyllabic
preposition such as *katika* 'on' is dropped instead. The resumptive pronouns are the
prepositional pronouns of matrix clauses, and the third person ones are the concords of
classes 1 and 2, the animate gender, which carry number and gender but no person. Inside an
adjunct island the resumptive is a bound pronoun matching the head in person; in a parasitic
gap it is a movement copy without person, the analysis of `Studies/Scott2021.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `Swahili.amba`, `Swahili.relativizers`: the relativizer *amba*
* `Swahili.pronoun`, `Swahili.resumptive`: the full and the resumptive pronouns by person and
  number
* `Swahili.NounClass.concord?`: the relative concord of classes 1 to 10
* `Swahili.Preposition`, `Preposition.TriggersResumption`: the prepositions and connectives
  with their syllable count, and the minimal-word condition on resumption

## Main results

* `Swahili.resumptive_third`: the third person resumptives are the concords of classes 1 and 2
* `Swahili.Preposition.triggersResumption`: the monosyllables trigger resumption and the
  trisyllable does not

## Implementation notes

* Scott gives the concords of classes 1 to 10 only, so `concord?` is partial. The concord is
  also the suffix of the emphatic copula *ndi-* of the clefts Scott's data come from.
* The syllable count is recorded rather than read off the form, since a syllabic nasal, as in
  *mtu*, would need the phonology.

/-! ### The amba relative clause -/

/-- The complementizer *amba* with the relative concord of the head's class. A relativized
subject or direct object leaves a gap, and the verb agrees with both. The object of a
monosyllabic preposition is resumed by a pronoun suffixed to it, a bound pronoun, the only
option inside an adjunct island, or a movement copy without person, diagnosed by parasitic
gaps. -/
