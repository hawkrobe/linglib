# Laal prosodic fragment

[lionnet-2022]

Theory-neutral tone data for Laal (language isolate, southern Chad): the three
contrastive tone heights H/M/L, the attested stem-level tone melodies (Table 2),
and verb roots illustrating M-lowering. Transcriptional facts only — the
subtonal `[±upper]`/`[±raised]` featural analysis and the M-lowering mechanism
live in `Studies/Lionnet2022Laal.lean`.

`kúmá`/`kūmā`/`kùmà` (ex. 8). Theory-neutral transcription. -/

/-- The minimal tone triplet on a `kVmV` segmental frame (ex. 8): three stems
contrasting in tone alone. -/

/-- The seven regular stem-level tone melodies on mono- and disyllabic stems
(Table 2). Every combination of H and L is attested; M occurs only as the sole
tone — the empirical basis of the M-exclusivity (`*MX/XM`) generalisation. -/

/-- Verb roots illustrating M-lowering: under stratum-2 suffixation the M-toned
root lowers to L, while H- and L-toned roots are stable (ex. 10–11, 60). -/
