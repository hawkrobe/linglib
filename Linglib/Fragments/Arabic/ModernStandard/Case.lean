# Modern Standard Arabic case

Modern Standard Arabic has three cases, the nominative (*rafʿ*), the genitive (*jarr*) and the
accusative (*naSb*), marked by a suffix at the end of a noun or adjective: in the base
declension *-u*, *-i* and *-a*, followed on an indefinite by nunation, a final *-n*
([ryding-2005] ch. 7 §5, p. 166). The spoken varieties do not mark case (p. 166), so the case
system is that of the written language.

A noun is in one of three states. It takes the definite article *al-*, or it is annexed, the first
term of a construct (*ʾiDaafa*) or a noun with a possessive suffix, with "neither the definite
article nor nunation" (ch. 8 §1.2.1, p. 211), or it takes nunation (ch. 7 §4, p. 156). The state is
a form and not a meaning: an annexed noun is definite or indefinite with the noun it annexes, and so
"looks definite because it does not have nunation, but it is not definite" when that noun is
indefinite (p. 160, fn. 40), and masculine names such as *muHammad-un* are "semantically definite,
but morphologically indefinite" (p. 164). The Universal Dependencies tag for definiteness, the value
of a token's definiteness feature, keeps the three states apart, the annexed noun being UD's
construct state ([de-marneffe-zeman-2021]).

A declension is "a class of substantives (nouns or adjectives) that exhibits similar
inflectional markings for case and definiteness" (§5.4, p. 182), and Ryding sorts nouns and
adjectives into eight of them (pp. 182–183), a classification she calls her own, "not
standardized" (p. 167). A declension is therefore given here by its endings, and a noun by its
stem and its declension, its form being the article, the stem and the ending. What a
declension's endings do not distinguish no noun of the declension distinguishes
(`Noun.form_eq_form_iff`). The triptote gives each case its own ending (§5.4.1, p. 183). The
dual, the two sound plurals and the indefinite diptote have one ending for the genitive and the
accusative, and "are considered to exhibit all three cases; it is just that the genitive and
accusative have exactly the same form" (§5.4.2, p. 187). The defectives have one for the
nominative and the genitive (§5.4.3, p. 197), and the indeclinables and the invariables one for
all three cases (§§5.4.4–5.4.5, pp. 199–200).

## Main declarations

* `Arabic.ModernStandard.Case`: the three cases, in the order of the grammars.
* `Arabic.ModernStandard.State`, `article`, `State.toUD`: the three states, the article of each,
  and their Universal Dependencies tags.
* `Arabic.ModernStandard.Declension`: a declension, by its endings, and the eight declensions.
* `Arabic.ModernStandard.Noun`, `Noun.form`: a noun by its stem and declension, and its form in
  each state and case.
* `Noun.form_eq_form_iff`, `Noun.injective_form_iff`: a noun distinguishes the cases its
  declension's endings distinguish.
* `Declension.triptote_injective`, `Declension.twoWay_eq_iff`, `Declension.diptote_eq_iff`,
  `Declension.defective_eq_iff`, `Declension.caseless_eq`: the cases each declension merges.
* `Declension.nunation`, `Declension.definite_eq_indefinite`, `Declension.construct_eq_definite`,
  `Declension.nuun_deletion`: how the endings mark the states.

## Implementation notes

The endings of the definite and the indefinite are read off the paradigm tables of §5.4
(pp. 184–201), one noun to a declension, and each noun's forms are checked against its table.
The annexed endings are the definite ones less the final *nuun* of the dual and the sound
masculine plural (pp. 189, 191, 211), checked against Ryding's examples of annexed nouns.

Ryding hyphenates morph boundaries, but not consistently (*al-bayt-u* and *bayt-u-n* beside
*al-muHaamii*, *mustashfan*), so the forms are her transliterations without the hyphens inside
the word, the boundary between stem and ending being given by the stem. The endings of the
defectives and the indeclinables are the ones Ryding names, *-in* (p. 198, fn. 99), *-ii*, *-an*
and *-aa* (p. 169, fn. 55); the ending of the invariables is their *-aa* (p. 169, fn. 55), and
the sound feminine plural's ending includes its suffix *-aat*, on which it is marked for case
(p. 191).

Ryding numbers the declensions but gives the two sound plurals different numbers on p. 183 and
p. 187, so the declensions go by name here. Her defective declension also takes in diptote
plurals such as *maqaah-in* 'cafés', whose indefinite accusative *maqaah-iy-a* has no nunation
(p. 198); `Declension.defective` is the declension of the singular *muHaam-in*. The five nouns
of the triptote, *ʾab* 'father' and the rest, which lengthen the case vowel when annexed
(pp. 186–187), are not represented.
