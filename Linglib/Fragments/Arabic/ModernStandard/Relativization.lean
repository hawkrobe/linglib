# Modern Standard Arabic relative clauses

Modern Standard Arabic relative clauses are definite or indefinite with their antecedent
([ryding-2005] ch. 14, pp. 322–325). A definite clause is introduced by the definite relative
pronoun *alladhii*, which agrees with the antecedent in number and gender and, in the dual, in
case; an indefinite clause has no relative pronoun. In both, a relativized subject is left
unfilled, and the object of a verb or a preposition is resumed by a personal pronoun, the
*ʿaaʾid* 'returner'.

## Main declarations

* `Arabic.ModernStandard.relativePronoun`: the nine forms of the definite relative pronoun.
* `Arabic.ModernStandard.relativePronoun_ne_iff_dual`, `relativePronoun_inj`: only the dual
  distinguishes case, and every form marks number and gender.
* `Arabic.ModernStandard.relativePronoun_dual_syncretism`: the dual relative pronoun has the
  case syncretism of the dual declension.
* `Arabic.ModernStandard.relativizer`: the relativizer of an antecedent of each definiteness.

## Implementation notes

The forms are Ryding's transliterations. The relativizer is indexed by the antecedent's
definiteness, which decides only its form: resumption occurs "in definite and indefinite
relative clauses" alike (p. 324), so the realization does not depend on it. The relative
pronoun agrees with the antecedent, not with the relativized position, so a relativized subject
is a gap whichever form the pronoun takes.

Ryding states the resumptive rule for the object of a verb or a preposition (p. 324), which
covers the direct object, the indirect object, a second accusative or the object of *li-* or
*ʾilaa* (p. 70), the oblique, and the object of comparison, the object of the preposition *min*
'than' (p. 246, p. 378). The genitive is recorded with a resumptive on [keenan-comrie-1977]'s
Tables 1 and 2 (pp. 76, 93), whose Arabic rows, Classical Arabic in Table 1, agree with Ryding's
rule at every position the rule covers.

The free relatives with *maa* and *man* (§5, pp. 325–327) have no head noun and are not
recorded.

## TODO

Ryding does not treat relativization of a possessor; the genitive wants a page in a grammar of
Modern Standard Arabic.

/-! ### The definite relative pronoun -/

/-- The definite relative pronoun, by the number and gender of its antecedent and by case
([ryding-2005] p. 322), with the feminine plural's variants *allaatii* and *allawaatii*; empty
outside the singular, dual and plural and the two genders. The plural is used only of human
referents (p. 323). -/

/-! ### The relativizer -/

/-- The relativizer of an antecedent of definiteness `d`: the definite relative pronoun, cited in
the masculine singular, for a definite antecedent (§2, p. 323), and none for an indefinite one
(§3, p. 324). A relativized subject is left unfilled, the verb agreeing with it: *hiya llatii
ʾarsal-at-i l-duktuur-a* 'she is the one who sent the doctor' (p. 323), *fii ziyaarat-in
li-dimashq-a ta-staghriq-u ʾusbuuʿ-an* 'on a visit to Damascus [which] lasts a week' (p. 324).
In the dual the pronoun takes the antecedent's case, not the relativized position's: in
*li-l-zawj-ayni lladh-ayni ya-ntaZir-aani* 'for the couple who are awaiting' the antecedent is
genitive and the relativized position the subject (p. 323). Every lower position is resumed by
a personal pronoun, the *ʿaaʾid*, which "must be inserted" (p. 324): *al-kitaab-u lladhii
qaraʾ-naa-hu* 'the book that we read (it)' (p. 324), *wa-qaal-a fii muʾtamar-in SiHaafiyy-in
ʿaqad-a-hu ʾams-i* 'he said in a press conference [which] he held (it) yesterday' (p. 325). -/

  form := match d with
    | .definite => "alladhii"
    | .indefinite => "∅"
  placement := .postNominal
  realize
    | .subject => {.gap}
    | _ => {.resumptive}
