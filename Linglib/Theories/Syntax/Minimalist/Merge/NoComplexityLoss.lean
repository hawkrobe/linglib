# No Complexity Loss (NCL) for algebraic Merge
@cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025} Proposition 1.6.10, book p. 72.

Implements M-C-B Definition 1.6.2 (book p. 64) and Proposition 1.6.10
(book p. 72): a workspace transformation `F → F'` satisfies **No
Complexity Loss** if some component map `Φ₀` from `F` to `F'` is
nondecreasing in `leafCount` (the algebraic analog of MCB's "degree").

Quoting M-C-B (book p. 72): "deg(𝔐(T_i, T_j)) = deg(T_i) + deg(T_j),
which is greater than or equal to both deg(T_i) and deg(T_j). All the
remaining components of the workspace not used by Merge maintain the
same degree. For Internal Merge, similarly, deg(T_v, T/T_v) = deg(T)."

## Contents

- `NCLBetween F F'`: existential form of NCL — there exists a component
  map satisfying the nondecreasing-leafCount condition.
- `em_case1_satisfiesNCL`: the EM Case-1 transformation
  `{S, S'} + F̂ → {.node S S'} + F̂` satisfies NCL via the map
  `S, S' ↦ .node S S'`; each spectator maps to itself.
- `im_satisfiesNCL`: the IM transformation `{T} → {.node Q β}` (where
  Q = T/β via cut c0) satisfies NCL via the constant map; the leafCount
  equality follows from `CutShape.cut_leafCount_conservation` (the Δ^d
  analog of MCB's degree-conservation remark).

## Status

Both EM Case-1 and IM positive directions sorry-free.

## InducedMapNCL: MCB Def 1.6.2 verbatim form

`NCLBetween` is the existential form (some map works). MCB Def 1.6.2
demands the **canonical** induced map Φ_0 : π_0(F) → π_0(Φ(F))
satisfies the inequality — Φ_0 is determined by Φ (it sends each
root to the component containing its image).

`InducedMapNCL F F' Φ_0` exposes the induced map as an explicit
parameter rather than existentially quantifying it. This is needed for
the NEGATIVE direction (Sideward 2(b)/3(a)/3(b) violate NCL) — under
the existential form `NCLBetween`, one could falsely satisfy NCL by
choosing a non-canonical map; the strict form forces the canonical map.

## DL: degree-loss function (MCB eq. 1.6.4)

`DL Φ_0 F = min_{a ∈ π_0(F)} (deg(Φ_0(a)) - deg(a))`. NCL ⇔ DL ≥ 0.
Implemented as `DLValue` returning `Int` (so we can express negative
values without ℕ-subtraction issues).

## Sideward NCL negative direction (Prop 1.6.10 negative)

`sideward_2b_violatesInducedMapNCL`, `sideward_3a_violatesInducedMapNCL`,
`sideward_3b_violatesInducedMapNCL`: under the canonical induced map
that sends each original root to the component containing its image,
Sideward operations fail NCL because the deletion-quotient (T/T_v) has
strictly smaller leafCount than T.

## Architectural note

NCL is a *predicate* about Merge transformations, not a Merge operation
itself. It sits at the bottom of the Merge dependency chain (consumes
both External and Internal). When Sideward NCL lands, this file will
import `Sideward.lean` too.

/-- **M-C-B Prop 1.6.10, IM positive direction.** The IM workspace
    transformation `{T} → {.node Q β}` (where Q = T/β is the deletion-
    quotient via the unique cut `c0` extracting β) carries a component map
    satisfying NCL: `T ↦ .node Q β`, with `(.node Q β).leafCount = T.leafCount`
    by leafCount conservation under Δ^d (`cut_leafCount_conservation`,
    the Δ^d analog of M-C-B's degree-conservation remark, book p. 64 —
    paragraph after Def 1.6.2).

    Quoting M-C-B (book p. 72): "For Internal Merge, similarly,
    deg(T_v, T/T_v) = deg(T)."

    The substrate hypotheses match the ones for `mergeOp_im_composition`:
    `c0` is the unique cut with `cutForest = {β}` and `remainderDeletion =
    some Q`.

    Note: no `T ≠ β` hypothesis is required (cf. `mergeOp_im_composition`
    which does require it for non-degeneracy of the algebraic sum). For NCL
    the diagonal case is fine — the component map sends `T ↦ .node Q β`
    with leafCount equality holding regardless. -/

/-- **MCB Definition 1.6.2 (book p. 64), strict form.** The canonical
    induced map `Φ_0 : π_0(F) → π_0(Φ(F))` is named explicitly. NCL holds
    iff for all components `T ∈ F`, `(Φ_0 T).leafCount ≥ T.leafCount`.

    Compare to `NCLBetween`: that's existential ("some map works"); this
    one fixes the map. `NCLBetween F F' = ∃ Φ_0, InducedMapNCL F F' Φ_0`
    (with image-in-F' constraint).

    Required for the NEGATIVE direction (`sideward_*_violatesInducedMapNCL`):
    a Sideward operation might satisfy `NCLBetween` via some non-canonical
    map, but its CANONICAL map (sending each root to where its image lives)

/-- **MCB Prop 1.6.10 negative — Sideward 2(b) violates InducedMapNCL.**
    Under the canonical induced map sending each root to the component
    containing its image, Sideward 2(b) {T_i, T_j} → {.node T_i β, T_j/β}
    fails NCL because T_j ↦ T_j/β has strictly smaller leafCount.

    MCB (book p. 72): "the root of the component T is mapped (as in
    Definition 1.6.2) to the root of the component T/T_v in the new
    workspace F', with deg(T/T_v) < deg(T); thus, it violates the No
    Complexity Loss constraint."

    For the canonical map specifically: `Φ_0(T_i) = .node T_i β`,
    `Φ_0(T_j) = T_j/β = T_j_q`. The latter has leafCount strictly less
    than T_j (since β.leafCount ≥ 1 and conservation gives
    T_j.leafCount = β.leafCount + T_j_q.leafCount). -/
