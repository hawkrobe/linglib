# Connes-Kreimer Coproduct on the Bialgebra of Syntactic Forests
@cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025}

Per M-C-B 2025 Definition 1.2.8, the **contraction coproduct** on the
syntactic forest bialgebra is

  Δ^c(T) := T ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ T + Σ_{F_v} F_v ⊗ T/^c F_v

where the sum is over all subforests `F_v ⊂ T` consisting of disjoint
accessible terms of T, and T/^c F_v is the contraction-with-trace
remainder (Definition 1.2.4).

Equivalently, identifying the empty cut with the `1 ⊗ T` term:

  Δ^c(T) = T ⊗ 1 + Σ_{c : CutShape T} (cutForest c) ⊗ (remainder c)

This file builds:

- `comulTree T : Hc ⊗[ℤ] Hc` — the tree-level coproduct
- `comulForest F : Hc ⊗[ℤ] Hc` — extension to forests by
  multiplicativity (Δ^c on a forest = product of Δ^c on components,
  per M-C-B `Δ^ω(F) = ⊔_a Δ(T_a)`)
- `comulAlgHom : Hc →ₐ[ℤ] Hc ⊗[ℤ] Hc` — algebra-hom lift via
  `AddMonoidAlgebra.lift` (the algebra-hom property is needed for the
  bialgebra structure per M-C-B Lemma 1.2.10)
- `counit : Hc →ₐ[ℤ] ℤ` — the counit (algebra hom selecting the
  empty-forest coefficient)

Naming note: we use `comulAlgHom` rather than `comul` to leave the
short name `comul` available for the eventual `Coalgebra` typeclass
instance field (which takes `Hc →ₗ[ℤ] Hc ⊗ Hc`, the linear-map
projection of `comulAlgHom.toLinearMap`).

The Coalgebra/Bialgebra typeclass instances are NOT declared here —
that's a separate file once coassoc is proven (Foissy-style cuts-of-
cuts bijection or via Lemma 1.2.10's appeal to Connes-Kreimer for
Feynman graphs). The Hopf algebra structure requires the additional
quotient by `(1 - α)` for `α ∈ SO_0` per Lemma 1.2.10.

## Mathlib infra leveraged

- `Hc = AddMonoidAlgebra ℤ Forest = (Forest →₀ ℤ)` (from `Defs.lean`)
- `TensorProduct ℤ Hc Hc` with `⊗ₜ` notation
- `Finsupp.single F z : Hc` for basis elements
- `Finsupp.linearCombination` for linear extension from a function on
  basis elements
- `Multiset.prod` for the multiplicative-on-forests extension
- `Finsupp.lapply` for the counit (value at the empty-forest index)

/-! ## §1: Tree-level coproduct

For a single tree `T : DecoratedTree α`, define the contraction
coproduct as the explicit primitive `T ⊗ 1` plus the sum over
admissible cuts:

  Δ^c(T) = T ⊗ 1 + Σ_{c : CutShape T} (single (cutForest c)) ⊗
                                       (single {remainder c})

The empty cut `CutShape.empty T` contributes the `1 ⊗ T` term
(cutForest = ∅, remainder = T). The explicit `T ⊗ 1` corresponds to
M-C-B's "T as a member of the workspace [T]" primitive — not an
admissible cut, since there is no edge above the root to remove. -/

/-- Inject a forest into the bialgebra as a basis element. The
    singleton-workspace embedding for a single tree `T` is
    `forestToHc {T}`. -/
noncomputable def forestToHc (F : Forest α) : Hc R α :=
  Finsupp.single F (1 : R)

/-- The tree-level Connes-Kreimer coproduct.
    Δ^c(T) = T ⊗ 1 + Σ_c (cutForest c) ⊗ ({remainder c}). -/

  forestToHc (R := R) ({T} : Forest α) ⊗ₜ[R] (1 : Hc R α)
  +
  ∑ c : CutShape T,
    forestToHc (R := R) (CutShape.cutForest c) ⊗ₜ[R]
    forestToHc (R := R) ({CutShape.remainder c} : Forest α)

/-! ## §2: Forest-level coproduct (multiplicative extension)

Per M-C-B equation just above (1.2.10): "The coproduct (1.2.8) is
extended to forests F = ⊔_a T_a in the form Δ^ω(F) = ⊔_a Δ(T_a)."

Multiplication on `Hc ⊗ Hc` is the tensor-product algebra
multiplication, which gives `(a ⊗ b) * (c ⊗ d) = (a*c) ⊗ (b*d)`.
On basis elements this is `single F₁ ⊗ single G₁ * single F₂ ⊗
single G₂ = single (F₁ + F₂) ⊗ single (G₁ + G₂)`. So the
multiplicative extension correctly distributes ⊔ on both channels. -/

    coproducts over the components of the forest. -/

  (F.map (comulTree (R := R))).prod

/-! ## §3: Multiplicativity of `comulForest`

Per M-C-B (text just above Lemma 1.2.10): the coproduct on a forest
is the product of coproducts on its components. With `comulForest`
defined as `Multiset.prod (F.map comulTree)`, this is structurally
true: `Multiset.prod` is multiplicative under `+ ↦ +`/`map ↦ map`. -/

  simp only [comulForest, Multiset.map_zero, Multiset.prod_zero]

  unfold comulForest
  rw [Multiset.map_add, Multiset.prod_add]

/-! ## §4: Algebra-hom lift to `Hc`

`AddMonoidAlgebra.lift R A M` is the canonical equivalence
`(Multiplicative M →* A) ≃ (R[M] →ₐ[R] A)`. We construct the
multiplicative-monoid hom from `comulForest` and then lift to get an
algebra hom `Hc R α →ₐ[R] Hc R α ⊗ Hc R α`. The algebra-hom property
is exactly what's needed for the bialgebra structure per M-C-B
Lemma 1.2.10. -/

/-- `comulForest`, packaged as a `Multiplicative (Forest α) →* (Hc R α ⊗[R] Hc R α)`

    `Coalgebra` typeclass instance field, which takes the linear-map
    projection `comulAlgHom.toLinearMap`. -/

/-! ## §5: Counit (also an algebra hom)

The counit ε : Hc R α → R extracts the coefficient of the empty
forest. For the bialgebra structure it must be an algebra hom; the
underlying monoid hom is `F ↦ if F = 0 then 1 else 0`, which is
multiplicative because `F + G = 0 ↔ F = 0 ∧ G = 0` for multisets. -/

    (cardinality argument). -/

/-! ## §6: Δ^d (deletion coproduct)

Per M-C-B Def 1.2.8 with ω = d, Δ^d uses `remainderDeletion`
(removal + rebinarization) instead of `remainder` (contraction with
trace). Δ^d is what the linguistic Merge action uses (Lemma 1.5.1).
Algebraically Δ^d satisfies a weaker coassoc relation than Δ^c (per
Lemma 1.2.12, multiplicities differ at distance ≤ 1), but it's still
multiplicative on forests, so the algebra-hom lift works the same way.

When `remainderDeletion c = none` (the cut consumed the entire root
component — only happens for `CutShape.bothCut`), the right channel
of the coproduct term becomes `1` (the empty workspace). -/

/-- Helper: convert an `Option (DecoratedTree α)` remainder to the
    corresponding right-channel value in `Hc R α`. `Option.none` →
    `(1 : Hc R α)` (empty workspace); `Option.some t` → `forestToHc {t}`
    (singleton workspace). -/

    M-C-B Definition 1.2.8 with ω = d. This is the coproduct used by
    the action of Merge per Lemma 1.5.1.

    Algebraically Δ^d only satisfies a weaker coassoc relation than
    Δ^c (Lemma 1.2.12), so it does not directly give a Bialgebra
    instance — that comes from `comulAlgHom` (= Δ^c). But Δ^d is
    needed for the linguistic Merge operator, which lives elsewhere
    (next file: `MergeAction.lean`). -/
