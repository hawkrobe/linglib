# Karttunen (1974): *Until*, *When*, and the Two-*Until* Hypothesis
@cite{karttunen-1974} @cite{heinamaki-1974} @cite{dowty-1979}Karttunen argues that English has **two** *until*s:

- **Durative *until***: "John slept until 3pm." The main clause is durative
  (stative/activity), and *until* marks the minimum extent of the main event.
  Truth-conditionally, this is temporal overlap: A holds at the time of B.

- **Punctual *until***: "The princess didn't wake up until the prince kissed
  her." Requires negation in the main clause. Karttunen's key identity (§5,
  eq. 33): this has the logical form **NOT(A BEFORE T)**.

The punctual *until* presupposes **A BEFORE T ∨ A WHEN T** — the event
eventually happens, either before or at the complement time. The assertion
¬(A BEFORE T) then derives, via disjunctive syllogism, that A occurs at
T (temporal coincidence, i.e., *when*).

## Level

**Level 1 (point sets)**: all definitions operate on `timeTrace` projections,
at the same level as Anscombe. The eight English temporal connectives reduce
to four Level 1 primitives:

- *before* = ∃∀ + strict ordering (Anscombe)
- *after*  = ∃∃ + strict ordering (Anscombe)
- *when*   = ∃ overlap (this file)
- *while*  = ∀ containment (this file)
- *until*  = ¬*before* (punctual) or *when* (durative) — derived, not primitive
- *till*   = *until* (dialectal variant, Heinämäki Ch. 9)
- *since*  = ∃∈B ∀∈A + ≤ ordering (starting-point, Heinämäki Ch. 6)
- *by*     = ∃∈A ∀∈B + ≤ ordering (deadline, Heinämäki Ch. 8)

## Cross-Linguistic Evidence

Finnish lexicalizes the two-*until* distinction: **kunnes** / **siihen saakka**
(durative) vs **ennenkuin** (punctual, literally 'before-than'). The Finnish
punctual form is morphologically *before*, confirming Karttunen's analysis.

-- ============================================================================
-- § 1: Definitions
-- ============================================================================

/-- *When*: temporal coincidence (∃-overlap).
    "A when B" holds when some time point belongs to both A and B. -/
def Karttunen.when_ (A B : SentDenotation Time) : Prop :=
  ∃ t, t ∈ timeTrace A ∧ t ∈ timeTrace B

/-- *While*: temporal containment (∀-inclusion).
    "A while B" holds when every time in A is also a time in B.
    Stronger than *when* (which requires only one shared point).

    This matches the implicit definition in Rett (2026, §3.3)
    used to prove *while* is not ambidirectional. -/
def Karttunen.while_ (A B : SentDenotation Time) : Prop :=
  ∀ t ∈ timeTrace A, t ∈ timeTrace B

/-- Durative *until*: the main event persists at least to the complement time.
    Truth-conditionally equivalent to *when* at Level 1: ∃-overlap.

    The difference from *when* is a **selectional restriction**: *until*
    requires A to be durative (stative/activity). Combined with the
    subinterval property of statives, overlap entails continuous persistence
    of A up to the time of B — the "minimum length" semantics
    (Karttunen 1974, p. 272). -/
def Karttunen.until (A B : SentDenotation Time) : Prop :=
  ∃ t, t ∈ timeTrace A ∧ t ∈ timeTrace B

/-- *Till*: dialectal variant of durative *until* (Heinämäki 1974, Ch. 9).
    Truth-conditionally identical to durative *until* (= *when* = ∃-overlap).
    Dialectally restricted in English; some varieties use *till* where
    standard English uses *until*. -/
def Karttunen.till (A B : SentDenotation Time) : Prop :=
  ∃ t, t ∈ timeTrace A ∧ t ∈ timeTrace B

/-- *Since*: lower-bound / starting-point semantics (Heinämäki 1974, Ch. 6).
    "A since B" holds when some B-time precedes or coincides with all A-times.
    This mirrors *before* with swapped arguments and non-strict ordering:
    *before* = ∃t∈A, ∀t'∈B, t < t'; *since* = ∃t∈B, ∀t'∈A, t ≤ t'.

    Veridical for B (the ∃ over B forces a witness).
    Equivalent to `by_` with swapped arguments: `since A B ↔ by_ B A`. -/
def Karttunen.since (A B : SentDenotation Time) : Prop :=
  ∃ t ∈ timeTrace B, ∀ t' ∈ timeTrace A, t ≤ t'

/-- *By*: deadline / upper-bound semantics (Heinämäki 1974, Ch. 8).
    "A by B" holds when some A-time precedes or coincides with all B-times.
    "He arrived by 3pm" = his arrival has a time point at or before 3pm.

    Weaker than *before* (allows temporal coincidence: ≤ rather than <).
    Veridical for A (the ∃ over A forces a witness). -/
def Karttunen.by_ (A B : SentDenotation Time) : Prop :=
  ∃ t ∈ timeTrace A, ∀ t' ∈ timeTrace B, t ≤ t'

/-- Punctual *until* = ¬(*before*) (Karttunen 1974, eq. 33).
    "The princess didn't wake up until the prince kissed her"
    = NOT(the princess woke up BEFORE the prince kissed her).

    Presupposes A BEFORE T ∨ A WHEN T (lateness: the event eventually happens). -/

/-- **Karttunen's main result** (eq. 33): punctual *until* unfolds to
    "every A-time has some B-time at or before it."

    "not A until B" = ¬(∃t∈A, ∀t'∈B, t<t') = ∀t∈A, ∃t'∈B, t'≤t.

    This is logically equivalent to: every occurrence of A is preceded by
    (or coincides with) some occurrence of B. -/

    exact hle (hall t' ht')

/-- Finnish confirms Karttunen: the punctual *until* form **ennenkuin**
    is morphologically *ennen* ('before') + *kuin* ('than'), i.e.,
    literal *before*-than — the negation is external to the connective.

    This is definitionally true since `notUntil = ¬before`. -/

    The event eventually happens — either before or at the complement time.

    Combined with the assertion ¬(A BEFORE T), the presupposition yields
    A WHEN T (temporal coincidence) by disjunctive syllogism.

    This derives the intuitive meaning: "not until B" ≈ "at B". -/

-- § 7: Veridicality Summary
-- ============================================================================

/-- Veridicality summary for the five temporal connectives at Level 1:
    - *before*: complement NOT veridical (∀ vacuously true on empty B)
    - *after*:  complement veridical (∃ witness required)
    - *when*:   complement veridical (∃ overlap witness)
    - *while*:  complement veridical only when A nonempty (∀ vacuously true)
    - *until* (durative): complement veridical (= when)
    - *until* (punctual): complement NOT veridical by assertion alone

    The veridical/non-veridical split mirrors the quantifier structure:
    ∃-based connectives (after, when, durative until) are veridical;
    ∀-based connectives (before, while, punctual until) are non-veridical
