# Continuation Effect: Scope-Taking

The continuation effect models scope-taking expressions (quantifiers, focus,
wh-phrases) in dynamic semantics. Re-exports `Linglib.Core.Continuation`.

See Barker (2002), Shan (2005), Charlow (2019, 2020) for the use of
continuations in natural language semantics.
