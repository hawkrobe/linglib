# Preferential Attitude Semantics

Degree-based semantics for preferential attitude verbs like `hope`, `fear`,
`worry`, `wish`, `expect`, following @cite{villalta-2008} and @cite{romero-2015-salt}.

## Semantic Mechanism

Unlike doxastic attitudes (which use accessibility relations), preferential
attitudes use **degree comparison**:

⟦x hopes p⟧(w, C) = μ_hope(x, p) > θ_hope(C)

Where:
- μ_hope : Entity → Prop → Degree (preference function)
- θ_hope : ComparisonClass → Degree (contextual threshold)
- C : the comparison class of propositions

## Key Properties

1. **C-distributivity**: Does `x V Q` ⟺ `∃p ∈ Q. x V p`?
2. **Valence**: Evaluatively positive (hope) vs. negative (fear)
3. **TSP**: Threshold Significance Presupposition

## Architecture: C-Distributivity as Provable Property

C-distributivity is NOT stipulated — it must be PROVED for each predicate
from the structure of its semantics. Each predicate defines:
- `propSemantics`: how it combines with propositions
- `questionSemantics`: how it combines with questions

Then `IsCDistributive propSemantics questionSemantics` is a theorem.

## Grounding in Hamblin Semantics
@cite{uegaki-sudo-2019} @cite{villalta-2008} @cite{rooth-1992} @cite{qing-uegaki-2025}

Questions are **alternative sets**. Our `QuestionDen W` is the
extensional representation of `Semantics.Questions.Hamblin.QuestionDen W`.

### Why This Matters for TSP

@cite{uegaki-sudo-2019} derive TSP from the interaction of:
1. Degree semantics (μ(x,p) > θ) — from @cite{villalta-2008}
2. Alternative semantics (questions as Hamblin sets) — from @cite{hamblin-1973b}
3. Focus-induced presuppositions — from @cite{rooth-1992}

The key insight: **questions introduce alternatives**, and combining a degree
predicate with alternatives triggers significance presuppositions.

### The Derivation Chain

```
Hamblin question Q = {p₁, p₂,...} [@cite{hamblin-1973b}]
        ↓
Alternatives trigger focus semantics [@cite{rooth-1992}]
        ↓
Focus triggers significance presup [@cite{kennedy-2007}]
        ↓
For positive valence: significance = ∃p ∈ C. μ(x,p) > θ = TSP
```

### Rooth Integration (see `Focus/Sensitivity.lean`)

The compositional chain from focus marking to TSP is now explicit:

- `Focus/Interpretation.lean`: `FocusResolution` bundles ~'s two constraints
  (C ⊆ ⟦α⟧f, ⟦α⟧o ∈ C)
- `Focus/Sensitivity.lean`: `focusSignificance` derives the significance
  presupposition from a degree predicate + FocusResolution;
  `tsp_from_focus` proves significance = TSP for positive valence;
  `assertion_entails_tsp` shows TSP is entailed by the assertion
  (because ⟦α⟧o ∈ C guarantees a witness)
-/

/--
Convert our extensional question representation to Hamblin's intensional one.

`toHamblin [p₁, p₂, p₃]` = `λ p. p ∈ {p₁, p₂, p₃}`

Note: Equality of propositions is checked extensionally over a finite world list.
-/
def toHamblin {W : Type*} [BEq W] (Q : QuestionDen W) (worlds : List W) :
    Semantics.Questions.Hamblin.QuestionDen W :=
  λ p => Q.any λ q => worlds.all λ w => p w == q w

/--

those propositions that are answers to the question.
-/
def fromHamblin {W : Type*} (hamblinQ : Semantics.Questions.Hamblin.QuestionDen W)
    (candidates : List (BProp W)) : QuestionDen W :=
  candidates.filter hamblinQ

-- List ↔ Hamblin Equivalence (for finite worlds)

/-!
## Representation Equivalence

For finite world sets, our `List (BProp W)` representation is equivalent to
Hamblin's `(W → Bool) → Bool`. This theorem documents the isomorphism,
enabling future extension to full intensional semantics if needed.

### The Equivalence

Given a finite set of worlds W and a finite set of propositions P:
- Any `List (BProp W)` can be converted to `Hamblin.QuestionDen W` via `toHamblin`
- Any `Hamblin.QuestionDen W` can be converted back via `fromHamblin`
- The round-trip preserves answerhood for propositions in P

### Why List is Sufficient for NVPs

For NVP semantics, we only need:
1. Existential quantification over answers: `∃p ∈ Q. φ(p)`
2. Subset relations: `Q ⊆ C`
3. TSP satisfaction: `∃p ∈ C. μ(x,p) > θ`

All of these work identically on List and Hamblin representations for finite cases.
-/

/--
Answerhood is preserved by round-trip conversion (List → Hamblin → List).

For any proposition p in the original list Q, if we convert Q to Hamblin
and back (using Q as candidates), p remains an answer.

This shows the List representation loses no information for finite questions.

  constructor
  · exact hp
  · exact ⟨p, hp, by simp only [List.all_eq_true, beq_self_eq_true, implies_true]⟩

/--
Key semantic operations are equivalent across representations.

The existential quantification `∃p ∈ Q. φ(p)` that appears in:
- C-distributivity: `V x Q C ↔ ∃p ∈ Q. V x p C`
- TSP: `∃p ∈ C. μ(x,p) > θ(C)`

works identically on List (via `List.any`) and Hamblin (via function application
to the characteristic function of answers satisfying φ).

    (∃ p ∈ Q, φ p = true) ↔ (Q.any φ = true) := by

/--
Subset relations are preserved.

`Q ⊆ C` (all answers to Q are in comparison class C) is the same whether
we use List containment or Hamblin entailment.
-/

-- Significance Presuppositions (@cite{kennedy-2007}, @cite{uegaki-sudo-2019})

/-!
## Deriving TSP from Degree Semantics

### Background: Significance in Degree Constructions

@cite{kennedy-2007} observes that degree constructions carry **significance presuppositions**.
The positive form of a gradable adjective presupposes the scale is "significant" in context:

  "John is tall" presupposes height is relevant/significant

### Application to Preferential Predicates

@cite{villalta-2008} shows preferential predicates ARE gradable predicates with degree semantics:

  ⟦x hopes p⟧ = μ_hope(x, p) > θ(C)

As degree constructions, they inherit significance presuppositions. But the CONTENT
of "significance" differs by valence:

### Positive Valence (hope, wish, expect)

For predicates expressing desires/goals:
- Significance = "there exists something the agent desires"
- Presupposition: ∃p ∈ C. μ(x, p) > θ(C)
- This IS the Threshold Significance Presupposition (TSP)

### Negative Valence (fear, dread)

For predicates expressing aversions/threats:
- Significance = "there exists something the agent wants to avoid"
- But this is NOT symmetric with TSP!
- You can identify threats without presupposing a positive desire
- The presupposition is about threat-identification, not desire-existence

### Why the Asymmetry?

The key insight (@cite{uegaki-sudo-2019}): Positive predicates express **bouletic goals** — states
the agent wants to achieve. Goals inherently presuppose there's something desirable.

Negative predicates express **threats** — states to avoid. Threats don't require
a symmetric positive goal. "I fear the worst" doesn't presuppose "I desire something."

### Consequence for Anti-Rogativity

Only TSP (positive significance) creates triviality with questions:
- Assertion: ∃p ∈ Q. μ(x,p) > θ(C)
- TSP: ∃p ∈ C. μ(x,p) > θ(C)
- When Q ⊆ C: Assertion ⊆ TSP → trivial!

Negative predicates lack TSP, so no triviality, so they CAN take questions.

-/

/--
Significance presupposition content varies by valence.

This captures the insight that ALL degree predicates have significance
presuppositions, but the content differs:
- Positive: presupposes desired alternative exists (= TSP)
- Negative: presupposes threat identified (weaker, different structure)
-/
inductive SignificanceContent where
  /-- Positive: ∃p ∈ C. μ(x,p) > θ — "something is desired" (= TSP) -/
  | desiredExists
  /-- Negative: threat identification — no symmetric existence presupposition -/

Derive significance content from valence.

This is the key derivation: TSP is not stipulated, it FOLLOWS from
positive valence + degree semantics.
-/

TSP = presupposition that ∃p ∈ C. μ(x,p) > θ(C).
Only `desiredExists` has this form.

  | .threatIdentified => false

2. Significance content depends on valence (bouletic goals vs threats)
3. Only positive valence yields TSP-type significance

**Triviality identity**: When C = Q, assertion ↔ TSP.

This is the core of @cite{uegaki-2022} §6.5.4: the assertion of a non-veridical
preferential with an interrogative complement is **identical** to its
presupposition (TSP). Whenever TSP is satisfied (defined), the assertion
is true; whenever TSP fails, the assertion is false. The meaning is
L-analytic — its truth value is determined entirely by the presupposition,
leaving no informative content. This is what @cite{gajewski-2002} identifies
as the trigger for unacceptability.

## Veridical vs Non-Veridical Preferential Predicates

@cite{uegaki-sudo-2019} established a crucial distinction:

### Non-Veridical (hope) - TRIVIAL
```
Presup (TSP): ∃p ∈ C. μ(x,p) > θ(C)
Assertion: ∃p ∈ Q. μ(x,p) > θ(C)
When Q ⊆ C: Assertion ⊆ TSP → TRIVIAL
```

### Veridical (be happy) - NOT TRIVIAL
```
Presup: ∃p ∈ Q. p(w) ∧ μ(x,p) > θ(C)
Assertion: ∃p ∈ Q. p(w) ∧ μ(x,p) > θ(C)
                       ^^^^
                       TRUTH REQUIREMENT breaks triviality!
```

Even when Q ⊆ C, whether the assertion is true depends on WHICH answer p
is TRUE in the actual world w. This is the key insight: veridicality
breaks triviality because it adds a world-dependent constraint.

### The Deep Theorem (formalized below as `veridical_breaks_triviality`)

Triviality requires ALL THREE conditions:
1. C-distributive
2. Positive valence (TSP)
3. **Non-veridical**

If ANY condition fails, the predicate can embed questions:
- Non-C-dist → Class 1 (takes questions)
- Negative valence → Class 2 (no TSP, takes questions)
- **Veridical → Responsive** (truth requirement breaks triviality)

### Examples

| Predicate | Veridical | C-Dist | Valence | TSP | Takes Q? | Why |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|-----|----------|-----|
| hope | ✗ | ✓ | + | ✓ | ✗ | C-dist + TSP → trivial |
| fear | ✗ | ✓ | - | ✗ | ✓ | No TSP |
| worry | ✗ | ✗ | - | ✗ | ✓ | Non-C-dist |
| be happy | ✓ | ✓ | + | ✓ | ✓ | Veridical breaks triviality! |
| be surprised | ✓ | ✓ | + | ✓ | ✓ | Veridical breaks triviality! |

Build a veridical preferential predicate.

Unlike non-veridical predicates, veridical ones require the complement
proposition to be TRUE in the actual world:

⟦x is happy that p⟧(w, C) = p(w) ∧ μ(x, p) > θ(C)
⟦x is happy about Q⟧(w, C) = ∃p ∈ Q. p(w) ∧ μ(x, p) > θ(C)

The truth requirement p(w) is what breaks triviality: even if TSP holds
(some proposition is preferred), the assertion may be false because
the TRUE answer in w might not be the preferred one.

because the world variable doesn't appear.

-- Veridical Breaks Triviality: The Core Theorem

/--
**Core Theorem**: Veridicality breaks triviality.

Even when:
- TSP holds (some proposition is preferred above threshold)
- Q ⊆ C (question answers are in comparison class)

The question assertion can still be FALSE for veridical predicates,
because no TRUE answer in w may be the preferred one.

This is the key insight from @cite{uegaki-sudo-2019}: non-veridicality
is a NECESSARY condition for the triviality that makes predicates
anti-rogative.

### Proof Strategy

We show that under the specified conditions:
1. TSP is satisfied (h_tsp)
2. But for every answer p in Q, if p is true in w, it's not preferred (h_no_true_preferred)
3. Therefore the question assertion is false

This proves that TSP satisfaction does NOT guarantee assertion truth
for veridical predicates — the triviality derivation fails!

**Contrast Theorem**: Non-veridical predicates ARE trivial.

When TSP holds and Q ⊆ C, the assertion is ALWAYS true for non-veridical
C-distributive predicates. This is the triviality that makes them anti-rogative.

Combined with `veridical_breaks_triviality`, this shows the asymmetry:
- Non-veridical + C-dist + positive → trivial → anti-rogative
- Veridical + C-dist + positive → NOT trivial → responsive

-- The Complete Picture: Why Veridicality Matters

/-!
## The Triviality Conditions (@cite{uegaki-sudo-2019})

For a preferential predicate to be anti-rogative (unable to embed questions),
ALL THREE conditions must hold:

1. **C-distributive**: ⟦x V Q⟧ ↔ ∃p ∈ Q. ⟦x V p⟧
2. **Positive valence**: Predicate has TSP (threshold significance presupposition)
3. **Non-veridical**: Truth of complement is NOT required

### Why Each Condition is Necessary

**If not C-distributive** (worry, qidai):
- Question semantics has additional structure (uncertainty, anticipation)
- Assertion ≠ ∃p ∈ Q. propSemantics, so triviality derivation fails
- Predicate CAN take questions (Class 1)

**If negative valence** (fear, dread):
- No TSP (threat-identification ≠ desire-existence)
- Assertion not entailed by any presupposition
- Predicate CAN take questions (Class 2)

**If veridical** (be happy, be surprised):
- Assertion: ∃p ∈ Q. p(w) ∧ μ(x,p) > θ(C)
- TSP: ∃p ∈ C. μ(x,p) > θ(C)
- TSP does NOT entail assertion (wrong p might be true in w)
- Predicate CAN take questions (Responsive)

### The Formalized Results

- `hope_triviality` / `nonveridical_is_trivial`: Non-veridical predicates
  with C-dist and positive valence yield trivial meanings (assertion ⊆ TSP)

- `veridical_breaks_triviality`: Even with TSP satisfied, veridical
  predicates can have false assertions (truth requirement adds constraint)

Together, these theorems prove that non-veridicality is NECESSARY for
the triviality derivation that creates anti-rogativity.

-- Summary

/-!
## Main Results

### Proved Theorems (no axioms!):

1. `degreeComparisonPredicate_isCDistributive`: Any predicate built with
   `mkDegreeComparisonPredicate` is C-distributive. This follows from the
   semantic structure: questionSemantics = ∃p ∈ Q. propSemantics.

2. `hope_isCDistributive`, `fear_isCDistributive`, `expect_isCDistributive`,
   `wish_isCDistributive`, `dread_isCDistributive`: C-distributivity for
   standard degree-comparison predicates (derived from #1).

3. `worry_not_cDistributive`: Worry with uncertainty requirement is NOT
   C-distributive. Proved by contradiction: global uncertainty breaks
   the equivalence.

4. `degreeComparison_triviality` / `hope_triviality`: Class 3 predicates
   yield trivial meanings with questions (assertion ⊆ presupposition when Q ⊆ C).

5. **`veridical_breaks_triviality`** (NEW): The core @cite{uegaki-sudo-2019} insight —
   veridical predicates break triviality because even when TSP holds, the
   assertion can be false (no TRUE answer is preferred).

6. `veridicalPreferential_isCDistributiveAt`: Veridical predicates preserve
   C-distributivity for their world-sensitive semantics.

### Architecture:

- C-distributivity is a PROVABLE PROPERTY, not a stipulated field
- Each predicate DEFINES its propositional and question semantics
- Veridical predicates use world-sensitive semantics (`propSemanticsAt`, `questionSemanticsAt`)
- The classification follows from proved properties

This gives genuine explanatory force: "hope" is anti-rogative BECAUSE
its degree-comparison semantics makes it C-distributive, and combined
with positive valence (TSP) and non-veridicality, this yields triviality.

"Be happy" takes questions DESPITE being C-distributive and positive BECAUSE
it is veridical — the truth requirement breaks the triviality derivation.

## Highlighted Propositions and hope-whether

@cite{uegaki-2022} Ch 6 addresses apparent counterexamples to the anti-rogativity
of positive NVPs: attested "hope whether" constructions (@cite{white-2021}).

The solution uses **highlighting** (@cite{pruitt-roelofsen-2011}): clauses have both
an ordinary semantic value and a **highlighted value** — a subset of propositions
with privileged status.

### Key Insight

- Polar interrogatives (`whether p`): highlighted value = `{p}` (singleton)
- Constituent interrogatives (`who left`): highlighted value = ordinary value
- Declaratives (`that p`): highlighted value = `{p}` (singleton)

When `hope` is sensitive to the highlighted value rather than the ordinary
semantic value, `hope whether p` reduces to `hope that p` — no triviality!
The anti-rogativity prediction is preserved for constituent interrogatives
(highlighted value = full question = trivial) while allowing polar ones.

## Emotive Doxastics: Hybrid Representational + Preferential

@cite{anand-hacquard-2013} show that `hope` and `fear` are not pure
preferential predicates (like `want`). They have three components:

1. **Doxastic assertion**: the attitude holder believes φ is *possible*
   (∃w' ∈ DOX: φ(w') = 1)
2. **Preference assertion**: φ-verifiers are preferred to φ-falsifiers
3. **Uncertainty condition**: the attitude holder is *uncertain* about φ
   (both φ-verifiers and φ-falsifiers exist in DOX)

The doxastic component is what licenses embedded epistemic *possibility*
modals. The uncertainty condition is what blocks epistemic *necessity*:
necessity entails certainty, contradicting the uncertainty requirement.

This hybrid structure distinguishes `hope` from `want`:
- `want` is pure preferential — no doxastic component, no epistemic licensing
- `hope` has a doxastic component — licenses `might` but not `must`

### Evidence for the doxastic component (@cite{scheffler-2008})

`hope` can felicitously answer questions (providing doxastic information):
  A: "Is Peter coming today?"
  B: "I hope/\*want that he is coming today."

`hope` is infelicitous with certainty about the complement:
  "It is raining. #I hope it is raining." (vs. ✓"I want it to be raining.")

### Verifiers and Falsifiers

@cite{anand-hacquard-2013} define φ-verifiers in information state S as
subsets of S that are *certain* about φ — where φ's truth value doesn't
change with (monotonically) increasing information:

  φ-verifiers in S = {S' ⊂ S | ∀S'' ⊂ S': ∀w' ∈ S'': ⟦φ⟧(w') = 1}

For unmodalized φ, this simplifies to pow(S ∩ φ).
For modalized φ (might p, must p), verifiers are still pow(S ∩ p) —
modalized complements raise the same issue as unmodalized ones.

/-- Under emotive doxastics, `might p` contributes the same doxastic
assertion as bare `p` — modal concord.

When the complement is `might p`, the doxastic assertion becomes:
  ∃w' ∈ DOX: (∃w'' ∈ DOX: p(w''))
By vacuous quantification over the shared information state, this
reduces to: ∃w'' ∈ DOX: p(w'').
Both yield: DOX ∩ p ≠ ∅.

We model this by showing that the doxastic assertion for `p` and for
the function `λ w. diaAt R x w worlds p` (= "might p" evaluated at
the same DOX) are equivalent when the information state is shared. -/
