# Desire Semantics — substrate for `want`/`wish`/`hope`

This file collects three formalizations of desire ascriptions:

1. **von Fintel @cite{von-fintel-1999}** (`wantVF`): "every undominated
   belief-world is a p-world", where the world ordering is induced by
   which desires each world satisfies.

2. **@cite{heim-1992}** (`wantHeim`): "for every doxastic alternative
   `w'`, every closest p-world to `w'` is more desirable than every
   closest ¬p-world to `w'`". Three successive formulations from the
   paper are exposed: (27) naive Hintikka-style, (31) truth-conditional
   comparative-belief, and (37/39) the CCP-rephrased version with the
   (40) amendment as `wantHeimDefined`.

3. **@cite{phillips-brown-2025}** (`wantQuestionBased`): "every best
   answer in Q_c-Bel_S entails p", parameterized on a contextual
   question Q_c. Handles conflicting-desire ascriptions ("S wants p" +
   "S wants ¬p") by varying Q_c.

The first two are **belief-based** and packaged into a common
`BeliefBasedDesireSemantics` structure with a parametric no-go
theorem (`bbds_no_simultaneous_want_p_and_negp`): no belief-based
semantics can predict simultaneous `want(p)` and `want(¬p)` against a
single belief state. PB's `wantQuestionBased` *evades* the no-go by
selecting from `Q-Bel_S` rather than directly from `Bel_S`.

## Phillips-Brown 2025 metasemantic constraints

The PB substrate exposes four metasemantic constraints:

* **Considering** (paper §3.6): every cell of Q_c settles p.
* **Diversity** (paper §3.7, attributed to @cite{condoravdi-2002}):
  Q_c contains both p-cells and ¬p-cells.
* **Anti-deckstacking** (paper §3.7): for every "natural" proposition q,
  if some cell of Q_c entails q, then q is itself considered. The
  substrate parameterizes the constraint on a `naturalProps` test set
  rather than quantifying over all of `Set W` (see `isAntiDeckstacking`).
* **Belief-sensitivity** (paper §4.2, building on @cite{yalcin-2018}'s
  question-sensitive belief): Bel_S discriminates among the cells of Q_c.

The question-based mechanism is inspired by @cite{crnic-2014} (an idea
the paper credits as previously unformalized), parallels Yalcin's
question-sensitive belief on the doxastic side, and was independently
arrived at via a different route by Dandelet (situations rather than
questions).

The von Fintel @cite{von-fintel-1999} baseline (`wantVF`) is included as
a foil. The paper's central metasemantic identity (paper §3.4) is that
when Q_c is the finest partition (singleton cells), question-based want
reduces to von Fintel's standard semantics — see
`wantQuestionBased_finestPartition_iff_wantVF`. Heim 1992
(comparative-belief) is *not* formalized here; the no-go theorem
`wantVF_no_simultaneous_pq_and_negpq` covers von Fintel only.

The world ordering used by `wantVF` is structurally identical to
@cite{kratzer-1981}'s ordering (every desire satisfied at z is also
satisfied at w); see `worldAtLeastAsGood_iff_kratzer_atLeastAsGoodAs`
for the bridge.

/-! ## Decidable propositions

A `DecProp W` bundles a `Set W` with its `DecidablePred` witness so it
can sit as the element type of a partition list while remaining
`decide`-able. This is a structure (not `Subtype`) because
`DecidablePred` lives in `Type`, not `Prop`. -/

Mathlib's `s ⊆ t` and `(s ∩ t).Nonempty` are not auto-decidable on `Set`
(the elaborator does not unfold `Set.Subset` to see the underlying `∀`).
We expose `@[reducible]` aliases that *are* decidable under
`[Fintype W]` + `DecidablePred` for both arguments. The aliases are
definitionally equal to their `Set`-API counterparts and are intended
to read as the same operation. -/

/-! ## Propositional preference (von Fintel 1999, paper §3.5)

The paper's preference relation between answers `a, a' ∈ Q_c-Bel_S`:

  S prefers a to a' iff {p ∈ G_S : a' ⊆ p} ⊊ {p ∈ G_S : a ⊆ p}

— i.e. *strict* subset inclusion of satisfied desires. We expose the
weak relation `≤` via `SatisfactionOrdering.ofCriteria` and the strict
relation via `SatisfactionOrdering.strictlyBetter`; the paper's "best
answers" are the maxima under the strict relation, i.e. the
Pareto-undominated elements (see paper §3.5, p. 11:21). -/

/-- Proposition ordering: `a ≤ a'` iff every desire in `GS` that `a'`
    entails, `a` also entails. The Pareto-undominated elements under

/-! ### Anti-deckstacking (paper §3.7)

The paper quantifies over "all q": if some cell entails q, then q must
itself be considered relative to Q_c. The naive `∀ q : Set W` over a
finite model trivially fails on gerrymandered subsets — e.g. for the
`qNapRest` 4-cell partition, `q = {w₀, w₁, w₂}` is entailed by the
`nap ∧ rested` cell `{w₀, w₁}` but not settled by the `nap ∧ ¬rested`
cell `{w₂, w₃}` (which contains `w₂ ∈ q` and `w₃ ∉ q`). These
violations are artifacts of the encoding, not of the question.

The substrate solves this by parameterizing the constraint on a
**test set of natural propositions** `naturalProps` — the propositions
the modeller deems salient for the model. For PB's `qDeckstacked`
example, `naturalProps = [r, h]` correctly fails AD (cell `¬r ∧ h`
entails `h`, but `h` is not considered by `qDeckstacked` — the `r` cell
neither entails `h` nor entails `¬h`). For `qNapRest` and `qRainHappy`
with the same `naturalProps`, AD passes (those questions cross-cut both
basic dimensions). -/

/-- **Anti-deckstacking Constraint** (paper §3.7), parameterized on the
    test set of natural propositions `naturalProps`: for every
    `q ∈ naturalProps`, if some cell of `answers` entails `q`, then `q`
    must be considered relative to `answers`.

    The `naturalProps` parameter is the modeller's chosen vocabulary of
    salient propositions; passing the empty list trivially satisfies the
    constraint, so study files must opt in by listing the basic
    propositions of their model. -/

instance (naturalProps answers : List (DecProp W)) :
    Decidable (isAntiDeckstacking naturalProps answers) :=
  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (∀ _ ∈ _, _))

/-- **Belief-sensitivity Constraint** (paper §4.2, building on
    @cite{yalcin-2018}'s question-sensitive belief): Bel_S discriminates
    among the cells of Q_c — at least one answer is compatible with
    S's beliefs and at least one is incompatible. Blocks inferences

    conceptual resources to grasp the question. -/

suppressed. -/

/-! ## §3.4 metasemantic identity: finest question simulates vF

When Q_c is the finest partition (every cell is a singleton world),
the question-based semantics reduces to standard vF. The substrate
provides the construction parameterized on an explicit world list so
the result is computable and `decide`-able for concrete models. -/

The §3.4 metasemantic identity is proved via three helper lemmas
(singleton-cell preference reduces to single-world preference under
`worldAtLeastAsGood`; the question-relative belief filter on
`finestPartition` selects exactly the singleton cells of belS-worlds;
undominated singleton cells correspond to Pareto-undominated
belS-worlds), then a direct two-direction `iff` proof. -/

/-- Singleton-cell preference under `propositionOrdering` reduces to
    single-world preference under `worldAtLeastAsGood`: for cells
    `mkDec (· = w)` and `mkDec (· = z)`, `mkDec (· = w) ≤ mkDec (· = z)`
    in the proposition ordering iff `worldAtLeastAsGood GS w z`. -/

/-! ## @cite{heim-1992} comparative-belief desire semantics

The paper has three successive truth conditions for `want`, each fixing
a defect of the prior. We expose all three as a feature, not a bug — it
shows the trajectory and lets future readers reproduce the argument.

(27) The naive Hintikka-style `want` (paper §3, p. 192): "every bouletic
alternative is a φ-world." Heim immediately rejects it via Asher's
Concorde counterexample at (32) p. 194. We formalize it as `wantHeimNaive`
to make the rejection-by-counterexample testable.

(31) Truth-conditional comparative-belief `want` (paper §4.1, p. 193 —
the canonical "Heim semantics"): "α wants φ is true at w iff for every
w' ∈ Dox_α(w): every φ-world maximally similar to w' is more desirable
to α than any non-φ-world maximally similar to w'." This is the textbook
formulation.

(37/39) CCP-rephrased Heim `want` (paper §4.2.2, p. 197): same content,
but the proposition is restricted to Dox first
(`Sim_w'(Dox_α(w) + φ) <_{α,w} Sim_w'(Dox_α(w) + ¬φ)`). The (40)
amendment makes this **undefined** when the agent already believes φ
or already believes ¬φ — a presupposition failure that is the
formal mechanism behind Heim's account being unable to predict
simultaneous `want(p) ∧ want(¬p)`.

Heim does NOT use a Kratzer-style ordering source — she uses a
@cite{lewis-1973} / @cite{stalnaker-1968} similarity ordering on worlds.
The desirability `<_{α,w}` is treated as primitive (a relation between
worlds, parameterized by agent and evaluation world), not derived from
a desire-list the way vF's is. -/

/-! ### Heim no-go: comparative-belief blocks simultaneous `want(p) ∧ want(¬p)`

The proof shape: pick any `w' ∈ belS` (exists since `wantHeimDefined`
gives non-empty `belS ∩ p`). Pick any `x ∈ Sim p w'` and any
`y ∈ Sim ¬p w'` (both non-empty under `wantHeimDefined`). Then
`wantHeim belS params w_eval p` gives `pref w_eval x y` and
`wantHeim belS params w_eval ¬p` gives `pref w_eval y x`. Strict
asymmetry of `pref` — i.e., `pref w x y ∧ pref w y x → x = y` for the
weak relation, or `pref w x y → ¬ pref w y x` for the strict — yields
`x = y`, but `x ∈ p` and `y ∈ ¬p` (since Sim's first arg restricts to
`belS ∩ p` / `belS ∩ ¬p`), contradiction.

The substrate exposes the asymmetry as a hypothesis to keep the
no-go applicable to both strict and partial-order desirability
relations. -/

/-- A `belS ∩ p`-world reachable via similarity from any belS-world

/-! ## Belief-based desire semantics: structural typology and parametric no-go

A `BeliefBasedDesireSemantics` packages a desire-semantic device that
takes (Bel_S, parameters, evaluation world, proposition) and returns a
truth value, without any contextual question parameter outside this
shape. Both vF and Heim are instances; PB's `wantQuestionBased` is
*not* (its question parameter `answers` plays a non-trivial role that
varies per ascription).

The structure operates on `Set W` to match the substrate's underlying
predicates and to make the `want(p) ∧ want(¬p)` no-go statement
notation-clean (using `fun w => ¬ p w` rather than `Finset.univ \ p`,
which would require an awkward `Finset.mem_sdiff` rewrite chain).
Decidability inside instances is supplied via `Classical.dec` — the
structure is for Prop-level reasoning, not for `decide`. The
substrate-level `wantVF`/`wantHeim` retain their per-instance
decidability for concrete `decide` proofs in study files. -/

/-- A belief-based desire semantics on world type `W`. `defined`

/-! ## @cite{lassiter-2017} (apparatus) / @cite{lassiter-2011} (want application):
       Expected-value desire semantics

@cite{lassiter-2017} ch.7 (titled "Scalar goodness", *not* a desire
chapter) develops an expected-value semantics for evaluative gradable
predicates: `E_V(φ) = Σ_{w ∈ φ ∩ D} V(w) · prob({w} | φ ∩ D)` (eq. 7.22,
p.187). The book's positive-form *ought* (§8.14 eq. 8.72a, p.253) is
exactly the threshold reading `μ_ought(φ) > θ_ought` we adopt as `want`.
The book extends to *want* in a single sentence at §8.13 (p.249):
"*want* behaves as a gradable verb like *like, matter, care, [...]
need*." The detailed *want*-as-EU account lives in @cite{lassiter-2011}
ch.6 (NYU dissertation).

The substrate exposes:

* `Lassiter.expectedValue pr V belS p` — conditional expected value of
  `p` given the agent's belief state. Convention: returns `0` when
  `p ∩ belS = ∅` (Lassiter notes E_V undefined here, p.187 fn.).
* `Lassiter.want belS pr V θ p` — Lassiter-style positive-form want:
  `E_V(p|bel) > θ`. Matches paper §8.14 eq. 8.72a.
* `Lassiter.slomanPrinciple` (paper §8.6 eq. 8.16, p.216) — a constraint
  that the wanted proposition strictly dominates every other relevant
  alternative on the value scale.
* `Lassiter.wantWithSloman` — Lassiter's *full* account: bare threshold
  AND Sloman's Principle.

**The bare threshold form admits simultaneous want(p) ∧ want(¬p)**
(`Lassiter.threshold_admits_conflict_witness`), violating the substrate's
`BeliefBasedDesireSemantics.isConflictBlocking`. This makes Lassiter's
*bare apparatus* a sibling of vF/Heim/PB, *not* a `BBSemantics`
instance. Lassiter and Phillips-Brown are *different ways* of escaping
the no-go: PB via question-sensitivity, Lassiter via
probabilistic-decision-theoretic gradability.

**However, Lassiter's full account blocks the witness.** Per paper
§8.11 (p.245): *"we should not weaken the semantics to make room for
the simultaneous truth of ought(φ) and ought(¬φ). Instead, we should
allow that there are various, possibly conflicting **sources of
value**..."* Sloman's Principle (eq. 8.16, p.216;
`Lassiter.wantWithSloman_blocks_conflict`) excludes the witness on a
single value function; genuine conflicting wants come from multiple
value sources with weighted aggregation (§8.11 pp.243-245), not from
single-V threshold-tuning. The bare threshold's admission of conflict
is what Cariani 2013 attacks; Lassiter's response is *not* "let
single-V conflict happen" but "let multi-source aggregation explain
the data without single-V conflict."

The substrate exposes both layers (bare threshold + Sloman-augmented
full account) so the reader can see exactly which Lassiter-flavored
claim is being made. -/

    Indicator-style sums (rather than `Finset.filter`) make the
    definition `decide`-friendly for concrete witness models. The two
    sums are inlined (not `let`-bound) so that downstream `rw` calls
    don't have to unfold a `have`-binding. Returns `0` when the

/-! ### §4. Conflict witness for the bare threshold

A 4-world model demonstrating that the *bare* `want` operator (without
Sloman) admits simultaneous `want(p) ∧ want(¬p)`. Uniform prior 1/4 over
`Fin 4`; asymmetric value `V = (10, 4, 4, 0)`; threshold `θ = 3/2`;
`p = {w₀, w₁}`. Then `E_V(p) = 7 > 3/2` and `E_V(¬p) = 2 > 3/2`.

This is Lassiter Table 8.4 p.239 — Lassiter's reconstruction of the
Weakening-failure pattern @cite{cariani-2016} attacks within actualism,
applied to the EV semantics. Cariani 2016's own counter-model
(p.405) uses an actualist closeness ordering, not EV. Lassiter's
*response* is to add Sloman's Principle, which excludes the witness
(see `wantWithSloman_blocks_conflict_on_witness` below). -/

/-! ### §5. Sloman's Principle blocks the witness

Lassiter's *full* account adds Sloman's Principle (eq. 8.16 p.216).
On the conflict-witness model with `alts = [propP, ¬propP]`, Sloman
holds for `propP` (E_V(propP) = 7 > 2 = E_V(¬propP) ✓) but FAILS for
`¬propP` (E_V(¬propP) = 2 ≯ 7 = E_V(propP) ✗). So
`wantWithSloman` makes only `propP` wanted, blocking the conflict.

This formalizes Lassiter's §8.11 (p.245) position: single-V conflict
is blocked by his own constraints; genuine conflicting wants come from
multi-source aggregation, not from threshold-tuning. -/

/-! ### §6. Intermediacy of `expectedValue` (paper §7.5, §7.6 p.188)

Lassiter §7.5 establishes that `S_good` is an *intermediate* scale: the
goodness of `φ ∨ ψ` is between the goodness of `φ` and the goodness of
`ψ` (rather than maximal — equal to the better of the two — or
positive — strictly above both). In §7.6 (p.188), the disjoint union
formula

  E_V(φ ∨ ψ) = (E_V(φ)·prob(φ) + E_V(ψ)·prob(ψ)) / (prob(φ) + prob(ψ))

shows E_V is a weighted average over disjoint propositions, hence
intermediate.

We formalize the disjoint case directly: for disjoint p, q with
positive belief mass, `min(E_V(p), E_V(q)) ≤ E_V(p ∪ q) ≤ max(...)`.
This is the key abstract scalar property that underlies Weakening
(below) and is the empirical motivation for Lassiter's whole
expected-value semantics. -/

/-- A proposition has *positive belief mass* if some belS-world
    satisfies it. Decidability is inherited via the fact that
    `Set.Nonempty (belS ∩ p)` is decidable on finite types. -/

    (p : Set W) [DecidablePred p] : Prop :=
  (∑ w, (if belS w ∧ p w then pr w else 0)) > 0

/-- **Intermediacy of E_V (disjoint case)**: for disjoint propositions
    p, q with positive belief mass, `E_V(p ∪ q)` lies between
    `E_V(p)` and `E_V(q)`.

    The formal claim: when both sides are well-defined and the prior
    is non-negative on the support, `min(E_V(p), E_V(q)) ≤ E_V(p ∪ q)
    ≤ max(E_V(p), E_V(q))`.

    Proof is left as `sorry` pending the algebraic manipulation of the
    indicator-style sum (the inequality is well-known for weighted
    averages but the bookkeeping over `Finset.sum` of `if`-then-else
    expressions is non-trivial). The statement is the load-bearing
    item; consumers (e.g. `want_satisfies_weakening_disjoint`) can use
    it via the named theorem without waiting for the proof. -/

/-! ### §7. Smith Principle and Weakening (paper §8.10, §8.14 eq. 8.54)

Lassiter eq. 8.54 collects three constraints on `ought`:

* (a) **Sloman** (Sloman 1970): `ought(φ) → ∀ψ ∈ ALT(φ), ψ ≠ φ → φ >_good ψ`
  (already formalized as `slomanPrinciple`)
* (b) **Smith** (Horty 1993, 2003): `[(φ ∨ ψ) = W ∧ ought(φ) ∧ ought(ψ)]
  → ought(φ ∧ ψ)` — restricted agglomeration
* (c) **Weakening** (@cite{cariani-2016}): `ought(φ) ∧ ought(ψ) → ought(φ ∨ ψ)`

These are constraints on the `want` operator, not properties of single
propositions. We formalize each as a `Prop` relating two propositions;
the universally-quantified "operator satisfies the constraint" is the
`∀ p q` closure.

**Provenance for Weakening**: @cite{cariani-2016} introduces the name
and argues the principle is valid within actualist deontic semantics
(Cariani's own Counterexample to Weakening on p.405 attacks the
*conjunction* actualism + simple alternatives mapping; he wants to
preserve Weakening). Lassiter §8.14 derives Weakening from intermediacy
of E_V — see `want_satisfies_weakening_disjoint`. So in our
formalization, Weakening is *named* per Cariani 2016, *defined* as an
operator constraint, and *derived* (in the disjoint case) from the
intermediacy property of expected value (Lassiter §7.5, §7.6 p.188).
This honors linglib's "derive don't stipulate" discipline: Weakening
isn't a brute axiom — it falls out of the underlying scalar property.

Smith is stated as a separate constraint; its derivation requires more
structure than intermediacy alone (Horty 1993, 2003). -/

/-- **Smith Principle (paper eq. 8.54b)**: if `(p ∨ q) = univ` and
    both `want(p)` and `want(q)` hold, then `want(p ∧ q)` holds.

    Formalized as a `Prop` parameterized on a specific `(p, q)` pair.
    The "want operator satisfies Smith" is the `∀ p q` closure. -/

    both have positive belief mass, the disjoint-union expected value
    is at least the smaller of `E_V(p)` and `E_V(q)`. So if both
    exceed `θ`, so does their union.

    This is Lassiter §8.14 eq. (8.78)'s derivation: intermediacy
    means `E_V(p ∨ q) ≥ min(E_V(p), E_V(q)) > θ`. -/
