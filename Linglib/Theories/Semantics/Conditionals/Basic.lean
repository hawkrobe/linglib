# Conditional Semantics

@cite{lewis-1973} @cite{stalnaker-1968}

Compositional semantics for conditional sentences.

## Overview

This module provides the semantic building blocks for conditionals:
1. **Material conditional**: p → q = ¬p ∨ q (classical logic)
2. **Strict conditional**: □(p → q) - necessity of material conditional
3. **Variably strict conditional**: @cite{stalnaker-1968}/@cite{lewis-1973}-style conditionals

## The Material Conditional Problem

The material conditional (p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q) has well-known problems:
- "If pigs fly, then the moon is cheese" comes out true
- It doesn't capture "If A, then C" as speakers use it

However, following @cite{grusdt-lassiter-franke-2022}, we can maintain classical semantics
while deriving apparent exceptions through RSA pragmatics. The key is that
conditionals assert high conditional probability, not material implication.

-- Material Conditional

/--
Material conditional: p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q

This is the classical truth-functional conditional.
True whenever the antecedent is false or the consequent is true.

Equivalent to `pᶜ ∪ q` in mathlib's `Set` algebra; written here in
set-builder form to keep the conditional name discourse-meaningful.

def materialImp {W : Type*} (p q : Set W) : Set W :=
  {w | p w → q w}

-- Strict Conditional

/--
Strict conditional: true at w iff the material conditional holds at all
accessible worlds.

□(p → q) ≡ ∀w' ∈ R(w). p(w') → q(w')

This is the modal "necessitation" of the material conditional.
Used in deontic and epistemic conditionals.

Parameters:
- `access`: The accessibility relation R : W → Set W
- `p`: The antecedent proposition
- `q`: The consequent proposition

/--
A similarity ordering on worlds.

For variably strict conditionals, we need a notion of "closest" p-worlds.
This is typically modeled as a preorder on worlds centered at each world.

`closer w w₁ w₂` means w₁ is at least as similar to w as w₂ is.

/--
Variably strict conditional (@cite{stalnaker-1968}/@cite{lewis-1973}):

"If p, then q" is true at w iff:
- Either there are no p-worlds (vacuous truth), or
- Some p-world is such that q holds at all p-worlds at least as close

This captures the intuition that conditionals quantify over "nearby" worlds
where the antecedent holds.
-/

    (allWorlds : Set W) (p q : Set W) : Set W :=
  λ w =>
    let pWorlds := { w' ∈ allWorlds | p w' }
    -- Vacuously true if no p-worlds
    pWorlds = ∅ ∨
    -- Otherwise: some closest p-world makes q true
    ∃ w' ∈ pWorlds, ∀ w'' ∈ pWorlds, sim.closer w w'' w' → q w''

-- Conditional Entailment

/--
Conditional perfection: the inference from "if A then C" to "if not A then not C".

This is NOT valid for material conditionals but IS observed pragmatically.
The RSA model in GrusdtLassiterFranke2022 derives this as an implicature.

/--
**Conditional perfection is NOT semantically entailed**.

There exists a world where (p → q) is true but (¬p → ¬q) is false.
This shows that "perfection" (the biconditional reading) is a pragmatic inference,
not a semantic entailment.

Counterexample: World where p is false, q is true.
Then (p → q) is vacuously true, but (¬p → ¬q) = (true → false) = false.

/--
**Conditional perfection is NOT semantically entailed** (variably strict).

Even under @cite{stalnaker-1968}/@cite{lewis-1973} variably strict semantics (stronger than material
implication), the conditional does not entail its converse. There exist a
similarity ordering, propositions p and q, and a world w such that
"if p then q" holds but "if ¬p then ¬q" does not.

Counterexample: W = Bool, p = (· = true), q = (fun _ => True), w = false.
The conditional holds (the only p-world is `true`, where q holds trivially),
but perfection fails (¬p(false) is true but ¬q(false) is false).

/--
**Variably strict conditional implies material conditional** (with centered similarity).

If there is a p-world, the similarity ordering is centered, and the variably strict
conditional holds, then the material conditional holds at the actual world.

The centering axiom ensures that if p holds at w, then w is the unique closest p-world
to itself, so q must hold at w.

## Kratzer Conditionals
@cite{nadathur-lauer-2020} @cite{stalnaker-1968}

This section provides a **polymorphic, Set-based** version of Kratzer's
conditional semantics for use in mathematical proofs.

For the **computable, List-based** version with concrete examples and
proven properties (preorder, duality, K axiom, etc.), see:
  `Linglib.Theories.Semantics.Modality.Kratzer`

Both use the same CORRECT subset-based ordering from @cite{kratzer-1981}:
  w₁ ≤_A w₂ iff {p ∈ A : w₂ ∈ p} ⊆ {p ∈ A : w₁ ∈ p}
-/

/--
Kratzer's semantics for conditionals uses:
1. A modal base f : W → Set W (epistemic, circumstantial, etc.)
2. An ordering source g : W → Set (Set W) (stereotypical, deontic, etc.)

The conditional "if p, then q" is true at w iff
q holds at the "best" p-worlds according to the ordering.
-/

  /-- Modal base: accessible worlds from w -/
  modalBase : W → Set W
  /-- Ordering source: propositions that induce a preference -/
  orderingSource : W → Set (Set W)

/--
Kratzer's ordering relation (Set-based version for proofs).

w₁ is at least as good as w₂ according to ordering source `os` iff
every proposition in `os` satisfied by w₂ is also satisfied by w₁.

This is the **correct** subset-based ordering from @cite{kratzer-1981}.
Equivalent to `atLeastAsGoodAs` in `Kratzer.lean` (which uses Lists for computation).

**NOT** a counting-based ordering (which would be incorrect).

  { p ∈ os | p w₂ } ⊆ { p ∈ os | p w₁ }

/--
Kratzer-style conditional semantics.

"If p, then q" is true at w iff at the best p-worlds (in the modal base,
according to the ordering source), q holds.

Best worlds are those maximal under `kratzerBetter`: w' is best if
for all w'' in pWorlds, if w' ≤ w'' then w'' ≤ w' (i.e., they're equivalent).

## Selection Functions

Stalnaker's selection function approach to counterfactuals:
- A selection function `s : W × 𝒫(W) → W` selects THE closest antecedent-world
- "If A were, C would be" is true iff C holds at s(w, ⦃A⦄)

Key distinction from @cite{lewis-1973}:
- @cite{lewis-1973}: Universal quantification over all closest A-worlds
- @cite{stalnaker-1968}: Selection of a single A-world (with supervaluation for ties)

This is formalized for use in @cite{ramotowska-marty-romoli-santorio-2025} analysis of
counterfactual force under quantifiers.
-/

/-! `SelectionFunction` — defined in `Core/SelectionFunction.lean` and
opened above. Field name is `sel`; axioms are `inclusion` (Stalnaker's
"Success") and `centering`. The same selection-function infrastructure
underlies @cite{cariani-santorio-2018}'s selectional *will*; unifying
the two avoids a duplicate type. -/

/--
**Candidate selection functions** induced by a comparative similarity ordering.

Given an ordering, a selection function is "legitimate" iff it always

-- Selection ↔ Similarity Bridge

/-!
## Selection Function ↔ Similarity Ordering
@cite{stalnaker-1981}

A selection function induces a comparative similarity relation that is
*stronger* than what Lewis requires.

- **Similarity → Selection**: `candidateSelections` extracts the set of
  minimally close worlds under a similarity ordering. Any selection
  function that always picks from this set is "legitimate."

- **Selection → Similarity**: A selection function `s` determines a
  pairwise preference: `w₁ ≤_{w₀} w₂` iff `s(w₀, {w₁, w₂}) = w₁`.
  This is reflexive (by `success`) and total (by definition), but
  transitivity requires additional coherence constraints on `s` beyond
  `success` + `centering` — specifically, the selection function must be
  rationalizable by a total preorder on worlds. See `isCoherent` below.
-/

/-! `selectionPrefers` and `SelectionFunction.isCoherent` —
pairwise preference and the @cite{stalnaker-1981} rationality
constraint — are defined in `Core/SelectionFunction.lean` since they
depend only on the selection-function structure, not on conditional
semantics. They are re-exported via the `open _root_.Core` above. -/

/--
**Coherent selection functions induce similarity orderings.**

Given a coherent selection function, its pairwise preference relation
is a valid `SimilarityOrdering`: reflexive (from `success`) and
transitive (from coherence). -/

-- Connection to Causal Models

/-!
## Selection via Intervention

A key insight: selection functions can be grounded in causal models.

Given a causal model, `s(w, A)` = the world resulting from intervening
to make A true at w (Pearl's do(A)).

This connects:
- Stalnaker selection → Causal intervention
- "If A were" → do(A)
- Counterfactual dependence → Causal necessity

See `Theories/Semantics/Causation/` for the causal model infrastructure.
-/

-- Connection to Assertability

/-!
## Assertability vs Truth

The key insight from @cite{grusdt-lassiter-franke-2022} is that the ASSERTABILITY of a
conditional depends on P(C|A), not its truth conditions.

A conditional "if A then C" is assertable when P(C|A) is high (> θ).

This is formalized in `Assertability.lean`, where we define:
- `conditionalProbability : WorldState → ℚ`
- `assertable : WorldState → ℚ → Bool`

The RSA model then explains pragmatic phenomena (conditional perfection,
missing-link infelicity) through reasoning about assertability.
-/

-- Stalnakerian indicative/subjunctive split (@cite{stalnaker-1975})

/-!
## Stalnakerian indicative/subjunctive split

@cite{stalnaker-1975} argues that the indicative/subjunctive distinction is
*pragmatic*, not semantic: both have the same selection-based truth condition.
Indicatives require the selection function to obey the **pragmatic constraint**
(stay inside the context set when possible); subjunctives signal that the
constraint is suspended.

The previous identification `indicativeConditional := materialImp` was
inaccurate per @cite{stalnaker-1975} §IV ("This equivalence explains the
plausibility of the truth-functional analysis ... but it does not justify
that analysis"). We now derive the equivalence within an appropriate context
rather than stipulate it.
-/

/--
**Selection-based conditional**: "if p, then q" is true at w iff q holds at
the world selected by `s` from the p-worlds. This is the common semantic
core of @cite{stalnaker-1975} indicatives and subjunctives. -/
def selectionConditional {W : Type*} (s : SelectionFunction W)

/--
**Pragmatic constraint on selection** (@cite{stalnaker-1975} §III).

If the conditional is being evaluated at a context-set world `w`, and some
antecedent-world is also in the context set, then the selected world must
be in the context set. Equivalently: context-set worlds are closer to each
other than to non-context-set worlds whenever a context-set option is
available.

This is the central new contribution of @cite{stalnaker-1975}: it is what
makes the indicative inference forms behave the way they do, without
changing the semantic clause. -/
def pragmaticConstraint {W : Type*} (s : SelectionFunction W)
    (C : ContextSet W) : Prop :=
  ∀ w (A : Set W), C w → (∃ w' ∈ A, C w') → C (s.sel w A)

/--
**Mooded conditional** (@cite{stalnaker-1975}): the truth-conditional clause
is `selectionConditional` regardless of grammatical mood. The mood index `m`
is metadata at the call site, documenting whether an indicative or subjunctive
is being interpreted; the *semantic* mood difference is captured by which
selection functions are admissible in the context — see `admissibleSelection`.

Single source of truth: indicative and subjunctive conditionals do not have
distinct semantic clauses. Replacing two parallel defs (`indicativeConditional`,
`subjunctiveConditional`) with one mood-keyed wrapper makes Stalnaker's actual
claim explicit at the type level. -/
def moodedConditional {W : Type*} (_m : GramMood) (s : SelectionFunction W)

/--
**Mood-indexed admissibility on selection functions** (@cite{stalnaker-1975}).

Stalnaker's mood distinction lives here, not in the truth-conditional clause:
- `.indicative` requires the selection function to obey `pragmaticConstraint`
  on the context — the central new contribution of @cite{stalnaker-1975}.
- `.subjunctive` imposes no such constraint; the selection function may reach
  outside the context set, which is precisely what subjunctive mood signals.

This makes "indicative vs subjunctive" a property of the *selection-function /
context pairing*, not a separate semantic operator. -/
def Mood.admissibleSelection {W : Type*} (m : GramMood) (s : SelectionFunction W)
    (C : ContextSet W) : Prop :=

/--
**Mood is irrelevant to the truth-conditional clause** (@cite{stalnaker-1975}).

For any grammatical mood, the mooded conditional reduces to the bare
selection conditional. This is the rfl-equation that previously had to be
stated as `indicative_eq_subjunctive` between two parallel defs. -/
theorem moodedConditional_eq_selectionConditional {W : Type*} (m : GramMood)
    (s : SelectionFunction W) (p q : W → Prop) :
    moodedConditional m s p q = selectionConditional s p q := rfl

/--
**Selection conditional ≡ material within an appropriate context**
(@cite{stalnaker-1975} §IV).

In any context `C` evaluated at a context-set world `w`, given that the
antecedent is open in `C`, the selection function obeys the pragmatic
constraint, and the material conditional holds throughout `C`, the
selection conditional is true. This is the contextually-mediated equivalence
Stalnaker defends in place of the semantic identification.

Specialised to `.indicative` mood, this is exactly the Stalnakerian claim
that indicative conditionals reduce to the material conditional within an
appropriate context. The hypothesis `h_constraint` is precisely
`Mood.admissibleSelection .indicative s C` per `admissibleSelection_indicative`.

Hypotheses encode the "appropriate context" conditions:
- `hC_w`: `w` is in the context set;
- `h_open_p`: some context-set world satisfies `p` (antecedent is open);
- `h_constraint`: `s` obeys the pragmatic constraint relative to `C`;
- `h_C_imp`: in the context, the material conditional holds. -/

**Indicative-mood specialisation**: when the mood is indicative and the
selection function is admissible, the mooded conditional reduces to the
material conditional within the context. -/
