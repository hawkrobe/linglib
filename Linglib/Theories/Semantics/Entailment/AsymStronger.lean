# Asymmetric entailment over a finite world set

A polymorphic primitive: `ψ` asymmetrically entails `φ` over a finite
set of worlds when every ψ-world is a φ-world and at least one φ-world
is not a ψ-world. Equivalently, `worlds.filter ψ ⊂ worlds.filter φ`.

This is the shared core of "primary-implicature triggering" (Sauerland
2004 over `EpistemicState.possible`) and the asymmetric-entailment
fragment of various exhaustification operators. The intent is that any
study or theory file needing asymmetric entailment over a finite domain
of world predicates uses this rather than reinventing it.

## Why a polymorphic version

`Theories/Semantics/Entailment/Basic.lean` defines `entails` over a
concrete `World` enum (w0–w3) for testbed purposes. That file is not the
right home for a polymorphic primitive. This file is.

## What this does NOT subsume

- **`RSA.IBR.strongestAt`** (`Theories/Pragmatics/IBR/ScalarGames.lean`) —
  expresses "m is the strongest true message at s" as a unary predicate
  on messages, not the binary asymmetric-entailment relation. The two
  are linked (m strongest ↔ ∀ m', ¬ asymStrongerOn univ (G.meaning m') (G.meaning m)
  ∨ m' false at s) but the proofs in `ScalarGames.lean` are 200+ lines
  built around the unary form. Rewriting them on top of this primitive
  is a separate refactor.

- **`Magri2014.innerExcludable`** (`Phenomena/Plurals/Studies/Magri2014.lean`) —
  combines (a) a hand-wired `entails : Role → Role → Bool` on a
  three-element role enum with (b) a Horn-mateness filter. The `entails`
  is not derivable as `asymStrongerOn` over a world set because Magri's
  `Scenario` type isn't `Fintype` (arbitrary `total : Nat`). Lifting
  Magri to use this primitive would require either a Fintype-restricted
  Scenario or a separate non-Fintype variant.

Both are noted as future consolidation targets but require deeper
architectural work than a literal find-and-replace.
