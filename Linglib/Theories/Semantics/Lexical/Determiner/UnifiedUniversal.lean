# Unified Semantics for Universal Quantification
@cite{haslinger-etal-2025-nllt}

A single lexical meaning for universal quantifiers across languages,
from "A unified semantics for distributive and non-distributive universal
quantifiers across languages" (NLLT 43, 2025).

## Core Idea

The morpheme Q_∀ applies its scope predicate to every **maximal
non-overlapping** element of the restrictor denotation. Whether the
result is distributive or non-distributive falls out from the
algebraic structure of the noun denotation:

- **Singular NP** (atoms only): every element is maximal and
  non-overlapping → Q_∀ distributes over each atom. **[+dist]**
- **Plural NP** (closed under sum): one maximal element = the sum
  → Q_∀ applies scope to the sum. **[−dist]**

This is the **Distributivity-Number Generalization (DNG)**.

## Architecture

Q_∀ is defined abstractly over `PartialOrder` using `Mereology.Overlap`,
`Mereology.Atom`, and `Mereology.isMaximal`. A decidable `Finset`-based
variant is provided for computational verification.

The connection to the standard GQ `every_sem` (in `Quantifier.lean`) and
to the tolerance-based `distMaximal` (in `Distributivity.lean`) is
established via bridge theorems, not by replacement.

-- § 1. Maximal Non-Overlapping Elements
-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/--
An element x is **maximal non-overlapping** in P iff x ∈ P and every
P-element that overlaps x is a part of x.

This is the condition in @cite{haslinger-etal-2025-nllt} eq. (70):
P(x) ∧ ¬∃y[P(y) ∧ ∃z[z ⊑ x ∧ z ⊑ y] ∧ y ⊄ x].

Equivalently: x absorbs all overlapping P-elements. In a singular
NP denotation (atoms only), every atom satisfies this. In a plural
NP denotation (closed under sum), only the maximal sum does.

**Q_∀**: the unified universal quantifier.

⟦Q_∀⟧ = λP.λQ.∀x[maxNonOverlap(P, x) → Q(x)]

Q_∀ applies the scope predicate Q to every maximal non-overlapping
element of the restrictor P. @cite{haslinger-etal-2025-nllt} eq. (70).

When P = ⟦student⟧ (atoms {a,b,c}):
  Q_∀(P)(Q) = Q(a) ∧ Q(b) ∧ Q(c)  — distributive

When P = ⟦student-PL⟧ (closed under ⊔, max = a⊔b⊔c):
  Q_∀(P)(Q) = Q(a⊔b⊔c)  — non-distributive (maximization)

    (h : Overlap x y) : Overlap y x :=
  let ⟨z, hzx, hzy⟩ := h; ⟨z, hzy, hzx⟩

/-- maxNonOverlap implies isMaximal: if x absorbs all overlapping
    P-elements, it is certainly maximal (no proper P-extension). -/

    isMaximal P x :=
  ⟨h.1, λ y hy hle => le_antisymm hle (h.2 y hy ⟨x, le_refl x, hle⟩)⟩

/-- For atoms with a disjointness property, maxNonOverlap reduces to
    membership in P.

    The hypothesis `hDisj` says distinct P-atoms don't overlap. This
    holds in any atomic Boolean algebra (or distributive lattice where
    atoms are join-prime). -/

    maxNonOverlap P x :=
  ⟨hPx, λ y hy hov => le_of_eq (hDisj y hy hov)⟩

/-- In a CUM predicate, an element that is isMaximal is also
    maxNonOverlap. CUM ensures all P-elements join into the max,
    so any P-element overlapping max is necessarily ≤ max.

    Proof: if y ∈ P overlaps x, then x ⊔ y ∈ P (by CUM), and
    x ≤ x ⊔ y, so x = x ⊔ y (by maximality), hence y ≤ x. -/

**DNG for singular complements** (atoms).

When every P-element is an atom and distinct P-atoms don't overlap,
Q_∀(P)(Q) reduces to universal quantification: ∀x, P(x) → Q(x).

This is the **[+dist]** case: @cite{haslinger-etal-2025-nllt} eq. (30b).

**DNG for plural complements** (CUM with a maximal element).

When P is CUM and has a maximal element m, Q_∀(P)(Q) reduces to Q(m).

This is the **[−dist]** case: @cite{haslinger-etal-2025-nllt} eq. (30a).
The unique maximal element of a CUM predicate is the join of all
P-elements — the "maximal plurality."

    exact heq ▸ hQm

/-- In a CUM predicate, maxNonOverlap elements are unique (= the max).

    This derives `hOnly` for `dng_cum`: if P is CUM, any two
    maxNonOverlap elements must be equal (both are isMaximal,
    and CUM predicates have at most one maximal element). -/

/--
Q_∀ on an atomic restrictor is equivalent to the standard generalized
quantifier ∀x[P(x) → Q(x)], which is the denotation of `every_sem`
in `Quantifier.lean`.

This theorem bridges the mereological Q_∀ to the flat-domain GQ:
the two coincide when the restrictor has no mereological structure
(all elements are atoms with no overlap).
