# States-Based Gradable Adjective Semantics

@cite{cariani-santorio-wellwood-2024} @cite{wellwood-2015}

An alternative to Kennedy-style degree semantics (`Theory.lean`). Gradable
adjectives denote properties of states (type `⟨v,t⟩`), not measure functions.
The positive form works via a **background ordering** on states and a
**contrast point** that carves out the positive region — no covert `pos`
morpheme is needed.

## Key Idea

Each gradable predicate sits on an ordered domain of states (the background
ordering). The predicate's **contrast point** divides the ordering into a
positive region (states at or above the contrast point) and the rest.
Different predicates on the same ordering have different contrast points:
`warm` and `hot` share a temperature ordering but `hot` has a higher
contrast point.

Comparative morphology (`more`) introduces a measure function on states,
accessing the background ordering but discarding the contrast point. This
explains why "A is more confident that p than that q" has the same truth
conditions whether we use `confident` or `certain` — both share the
confidence ordering (CSW observation (72)).

## Architecture

`StatesBasedEntry` extends `ComparativeScale` (from `Core.Scale`) with a
contrast point. The background ordering is the ambient `[Preorder S]`.
This is a competing theory to `AdjectiveTheory` in `Theory.lean`; the
bridge theorem `statesBased_iff_kennedy` shows when they agree.

-- § 1. States-Based Entry
-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- A states-based gradable predicate entry (CSW 2024, §3.3).

    Each entry names a positive region on a background ordering of states.
    The `contrastPoint` determines the lower bound of the positive region:
    a state `s` is in the positive region iff `contrastPoint ≤ s`.

    The background ordering comes from the ambient `[Preorder S]`.
    `scale` provides the boundedness classification (open, closed, etc.).

    Example: `tall` and `short` share a `ComparativeScale HeightState` but
    have different contrast points. `confident` and `certain` share a
    confidence ordering but `certain` has a higher contrast point. -/

variable {S : Type*} [Preorder S]

/-- A state is in the positive region iff it is at least as high as the
    contrast point in the background ordering (CSW eq. 28b).

    This is the states-based counterpart to Kennedy's `positiveMeaning`:
    instead of `d > θ` (degree exceeds threshold), we have `c ≤ s`
    (state is at or above the contrast point in the preorder). -/

-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- Two entries are scale-mates iff they share a background ordering
    (same `scale`) but differ in their contrast points. Scale-mates
    form clusters like `warm/hot`, `confident/certain`, `cool/cold`.
    (CSW §3.3: different cut-off points for different adjectives.) -/
def areScaleMates (e₁ e₂ : StatesBasedEntry S) : Prop :=
  e₁.scale = e₂.scale ∧ e₁.contrastPoint ≠ e₂.contrastPoint

/-- `e₁` asymmetrically entails `e₂` when `e₁`'s contrast point is at
    least as high as `e₂`'s. Every state in `e₁`'s positive region is
    also in `e₂`'s, but not vice versa.

    Example: `certain` asymmetrically entails `confident` because
    certainty requires a higher level of confidence (CSW §5.2). -/
def asymEntails (e₁ e₂ : StatesBasedEntry S) : Prop :=
  e₂.contrastPoint ≤ e₁.contrastPoint

/-- Asymmetric entailment implies positive-region inclusion: if
    `e₁` asymmetrically entails `e₂`, then every state in `e₁`'s
    positive region is also in `e₂`'s positive region.

    CSW (65): "Ann is certain that p" entails "Ann is confident that p". -/

/-- CSW's monotonicity constraint (eq. 21): a measure function `μ` is
    admissible for a background ordering iff it preserves strict order.

    If `s₁ ≺ s₂` in the background ordering, then `μ(s₁) < μ(s₂)`.
    This is Mathlib's `StrictMono`. -/

/-- Comparative semantics on states (CSW eq. 37): "A is more G than B"
    iff the measure of A's state exceeds the measure of B's state.

    The key CSW insight: the comparative uses only the background ordering
    (via an admissible measure), not the contrast point. The positive
    region is irrelevant to comparative truth conditions. -/

/-- The comparative is independent of the contrast point: `more` accesses
    only the background ordering, discarding positive-region info (CSW §3.4).

    For any two entries `e₁`, `e₂` on the same scale, the comparative
    truth conditions are identical. -/

-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- When a monotone measure maps the contrast point to a Kennedy threshold,
    the states-based positive form agrees with degree-based comparison.

    CSW's framework and Kennedy's are equivalent over linearly ordered
    scales with measure functions: `contrastPoint ≤ s ↔ θ ≤ μ(s)`.

    Note: CSW use weak inequality `≿` for the positive form. The existing
    `positiveMeaning` in `Theory.lean` uses strict `<`. This theorem uses
    weak `≤` on both sides, matching CSW. -/

-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════

/-- Scale-mates have identical comparative truth conditions (CSW (72)):
    "more confident that p than that q" ↔ "more certain that p than that q".

    This follows trivially from the fact that comparative semantics depends
    only on the measure function and the states, not on the entry. The
    theorem's value is documentary — it makes explicit the CSW insight
    that the comparative is entry-independent. -/
