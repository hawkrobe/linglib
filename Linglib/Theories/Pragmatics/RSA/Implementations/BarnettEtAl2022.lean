# Barnett, Griffiths & Hawkins (2022): A Pragmatic Account of the Weak Evidence Effect

Extends RSA with a **persuasive speaker** who has a goal state w* that may differ
from the true world state w. The speaker's utility combines epistemic and persuasive
components (Eq. 6):

  U(u; w, w*) = U_epi(u; w) + β · U_pers(u; w*)

where U_epi = ln P_L0(w|u) and U_pers = ln P_L0(w*|u). The parameter β controls
persuasive bias (β=0 recovers standard RSA).

## Key Result: The Weak Evidence Effect

When β > 0, weak positive evidence can *backfire*: a pragmatic listener who expects
the speaker to show the strongest available evidence infers that the absence of
strong evidence means it doesn't exist, shifting beliefs in the opposite direction.

## Stick Contest Domain

We formalize a simplified Stick Contest (3 sticks from {1,...,5}, 10 worlds) and
verify the weak evidence effect computationally at β=2.

*decreases* the pragmatic listener's belief in "longer" below the prior.

had stronger sticks (like 5) available and would have shown them instead.
The fact that they showed a 4 implies they lacked stronger evidence." -/
