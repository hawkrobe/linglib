# Operational fragment-lambda: a stochastic-lazy unfold sampler

Operational counterpart to `FragmentGrammar.lean`'s joint density
`fg(F; F)` of [odonnell-2015] §3.1.8 (p. 94): the sampler that draws
from that density. The architecture follows the macro-expansion of
[odonnell-2015] §2.3.7 Figure 2.21 — `(fragment-lambda args body) ↦
(PYmem a b (lambda args (if (delay? args) (delay body) body)))` —
mapping each Church construct to a Lean component:

- `(PYmem a b _)` ⤳ `pypDraw` over `PYPState` with `PYM := StateT _ PMF`.
- `(if (delay? args) (delay body) body)` ⤳ `PMF.bernoulliMix` halt-coin per
  §3.1.8 (p. 92).
- The `(delay body)` thunks ⤳ `LazyTree.fragment` constructor.

The single remaining `sorry` is on `fragmentLambdaDepth_marginalises_to_fg`
— the depth-→-∞ proportionality theorem, documented in detail at the
theorem itself. Probabilistic-fixed-point machinery on ω-CPPOs of
sub-probability measures is the missing infrastructure (mathlib-level
work). All other operational machinery and preservation theorems
(`pypDraw_preserves_wellFormed`, `fragmentLambdaDepth_preserves_wellFormed`)
are real proofs via the `PYM.Preserves` combinator algebra.

/-! ## Pitman–Yor memoisation state

**Universe note**: types in this file live at `Type` (= `Type 0`) rather than
universe-polymorphic `Type u`. Universe polymorphism is blocked by the use of
`PYM α D Unit` in `modify`'s signature: `Unit : Type 0`, so universe-
polymorphizing `PYM` would require either `PUnit` (Type-polymorphic Unit) or
`ULift` threading throughout. Both are tractable; deferred until a downstream
consumer needs higher-universe support. Linguistic type domains (NTs,
terminals, rules) are all small types so `Type` is sufficient in practice. -/

/-- A Pitman–Yor memoisation slot for one input value. We track:
- `dishes` — the value sampled at the i-th distinct table
- `customerCounts` — how many customers have sat at each table

The lists are kept length-equal by the public API (`empty`, `seatCustomer`,
`addTable`); we don't enforce this as a structural invariant. Per
[odonnell-2015] footnote 14 (p. 60), multiple tables may share a dish,
which is why we keep `dishes` as a list rather than a set or finmap. -/

built from these primitives discharge preservation mechanically.

invariant chain. The algebra is general (not tied to WellFormed); promoted

/-! ## Pitman–Yor draw

Per [odonnell-2015] §2.3.3.2 (p. 59) and §3.1.6 (p. 89), the
(N+1)-th customer at a slot sits at:

- existing table `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ K) with weight `(yᵢ − a) / (N + b)`
- a fresh new table with weight `(K·a + b) / (N + b)`

where `yᵢ` is the count at table `i`, `N = Σyᵢ`, `K` = number of tables,
`a` = `hyper.discount`, `b` = `hyper.concentration`. -/

/-- Sample from the PYP at slot `x` with base distribution `base`.

Either reuse the dish at an existing table (with the §3.1.6 weights), or
sample a fresh dish from `base` and seat the new customer at a new table.
Both branches update the memo state appropriately.

The base distribution is `PYM`-typed (state-passing) rather than the
usual `PMF`-typed because in fragment-lambda the recursive children of
a fresh sample themselves invoke the memo (via `mem{L^B}` for B≠A in
the §3.1.8 equations). The slots for distinct inputs are independent,
so this state-threading is well-defined; a per-restaurant `PMF` base
would suffice if the children's states were marginalised first.

**Implementation note (exchangeability caveat).** When `base` itself
modifies state (recursive `pypDraw` calls add tables at other slots, or
even at the same slot if grammar recursion revisits `x`), the table
indices change between when this `pypDraw` decides "new table" and when
it actually adds the new dish. Operationally we add to the post-`base`
state. By PYP exchangeability the resulting joint distribution agrees
with a sequential interpretation; a faithful implementation would
either snapshot-then-restore or work in a memo-free `base : α → PMF D`. -/

/-! ## Lazy partial derivation trees -/

/-- A partial derivation tree under fragment-grammar generation. Three
constructors:

- `terminal t` — a fully-evaluated terminal symbol (the result of `unfold`
  reaching a terminal in [odonnell-2015] Figure 2.7, p. 52).
- `fragment x` — a non-terminal stored as a fragment-leaf: the type-level
  representation of the `(delay body)` thunks of Figure 2.21 (p. 71). When
  the body of `fragment-lambda` flips heads on the halt coin, the result
  at this position is `fragment x` rather than further recursion.
- `branch r x children` — a non-terminal expanded by rule `r`. The rule is
  stored alongside the NT and children so that downstream consumers
  (`samplesToCorpusCounts`) can credit halt-vs-recurse decisions to the
  specific (rule, position) pair, matching [odonnell-2015] §3.1.8's
  rule-indexed beta-binomial structure.

The third type parameter `R` is the rule type — typically
`ContextFreeRule T G.NT` for CFGs, abstract here so the same `LazyTree`
can be used by other generative formalisms (TAG, DM-PCFG variants).

The "complete" tree (no fragment-leaves anywhere) is the result of
forcing all delayed thunks until termination. -/

/-! ## fragmentLambda — depth-bounded operational unfold

The depth bound is a structural-recursion device. The mathematically-
intended object is the depth-∞ limit, which terminates almost surely
when the recurse probability is bounded away from 1 (geometric depth).
Formalising the limit requires probabilistic-fixed-point machinery not
yet in mathlib; the bounded version is genuine and ships now.

The structure of [odonnell-2015] §3.1.8 (p. 93) is

```
G^a_FG(d)  = Σ mem{L^A}(s) · ∏ G^root_FG(s'_i)        -- PYP-wrap + recurse on holes
L^A(d)     = Σ θ_r ∏ [ν · G^root_FG + (1-ν) · 1]      -- biased halt-or-recurse
mem{L^A}  ~ PYP(a^A, b^A, L^A)                         -- Pitman-Yor memoization
```

We split this into two co-located functions:

- `stochasticLazyUnfoldDepth` — the un-memoised §2.3.5.2 model (`L^A` with
  children recursing back into the unfold itself, no PYP). This is
  [odonnell-2015] §2.3.5.2's `stochastic-lazy-unfold` (Figure 2.18,
  p. 68) — a recognised standalone sub-model in the book. Fully defined;
  kept here as the reference for the un-memoised model and as a sub-step
  for understanding the §3.1.8 architecture.
- `fragmentLambdaDepth` — the **faithful §3.1.8 model** (`G^FG = mem{L^A}`).
  Each call wraps with `pypDraw`; the inner body recurses on
  `fragmentLambdaDepth` itself for non-terminal children — children's
  draws also consult the memo, faithfully matching §3.1.8's mutual
  recursion. Lean accepts this as structural recursion through the
  `pypDraw` lambda + `mapM` + `if` (the recursive call is on `n`,
  structurally smaller than `n+1`).
-/

variable {α β R : Type} [DecidableEq α]

/-- Depth-bounded **stochastic-lazy unfold** per [odonnell-2015]
§2.3.5.2 (Figure 2.18, p. 68). At each call to non-terminal `x`:

1. **Halt-or-recurse step**: flip the biased coin (§3.1.8 `BINOMIAL(ν)`,
   p. 92). With probability `1 − recurseProb x`, halt and return
   `LazyTree.fragment x`. Otherwise sample a (rule, RHS) pair via
   `recurse x`, recursively expand each non-terminal child at the next-
   smaller depth, map each terminal to `LazyTree.terminal`, and assemble
   `LazyTree.branch rule x kids`.

The rule is stored on the branch so `samplesToCorpusCounts` can credit
halt-vs-recurse decisions to the specific (rule, position) pair —
matching the rule-indexed beta-binomial structure of §3.1.8.

/-! ### `fragmentLambdaDepth` — the PYP-memoised §3.1.8 model

Wraps each non-terminal call with `pypDraw` so that previously-sampled
partial subtrees at the same non-terminal can be reused; recursive
children calls go back through `fragmentLambdaDepth` itself (PYP-wrapped),
faithfully matching [odonnell-2015] §3.1.8's mutual recursion
`G^FG = mem{L^A}` ↔ `L^A`-body-calls-`G^FG`-on-children.

The inner per-call body is factored as `fragmentLambdaStep` so the
preservation proof can apply combinator lemmas to a function with a
visible name and type; the two presentations are definitionally equal. -/

/-- The inner per-call body of `fragmentLambdaDepth`, factored out and
parameterised by the recursive callback `recur`. Captures the §3.1.8
biased halt-or-recurse step: flip a `BINOMIAL(ν)` coin; if recurse,
sample a (rule, RHS) and recurse on each non-terminal child via `recur`;
if halt, return `LazyTree.fragment y`.

Factoring this out as a named auxiliary makes
`fragmentLambdaDepth_preserves_wellFormed`'s induction proof tractable —
the elaborator can apply combinator lemmas to a function whose name and
type are visible, where it struggles with the inline `do`-block in the
original recursive def. The two presentations are definitionally equal. -/

/-! ## Wellformedness preservation -/

/-- `pypDraw` preserves `PYPState.WellFormed`: every state in the support
of the output PMF is wellformed, given a wellformed input state and a
wellformed-preserving base distribution.

The proof would observe that `pypDraw`'s two branches are:
- existing-table: `seatCustomer i` (preserves wellformedness via
  `PYPSlot.seatCustomer_wellFormed`)
- new-table: `addTable dish` after sampling from `base` (preserves via
  `PYPSlot.addTable_wellFormed` + base's preservation hypothesis)

Combined with `PYPState.updateSlot_wellFormed`, both branches yield a
wellformed state. The PMF support is contained in the union of these
branches' images, so all output states are wellformed.

**Status: sorry**. As of `0.230.519`'s seatCustomer-discharge iteration,
the slot-level lemmas (`seatCustomer_wellFormed`, `addTable_wellFormed`)
are real proofs. The remaining obstacle is PMF.support reasoning through
the do-block: `pypDraw` is a chain of binds, and the support of a bind
is `{b | ∃ a ∈ p.support, b ∈ (f a).support}` (`PMF.mem_support_bind_iff`).
Proving the result via this chain is mechanical (~50-100 LOC) but
requires patient manipulation of `PMF.support_pure`, `support_bind`,
support of `PMF.normalize`, etc. -/

/-- Convert a `PYPSlot` to a sigma-pair `Σ n, OrderedFinpartition n`
suitable for `AdaptorGrammar.TableAssignment`. Three branches:

1. **Empty slot** (`numCustomers = 0`): returns `⟨0, default⟩` directly.
   Preserves the depth-0 lemma's `from rfl` chain (the empty case is
   defeq to `AdaptorGrammar.emptyTables G`'s entry).
2. **Non-empty wellformed slot** (`∀ c ∈ customerCounts, 0 < c`): builds
   a real `Composition s.numCustomers` and projects via the new
   `Composition.toOrderedFinpartition` (in `Linglib/Core/Probability/PitmanYor.lean`).
   The resulting partition faithfully captures the slot's table-grouping
   structure — what `pypFactor` actually depends on for its EPPF value.
3. **Non-empty non-wellformed slot** (a `customerCount` is `0`): falls
   back to `OrderedFinpartition.atomic`. This branch is *unreachable*
   under the sampler's invariant (`pypDraw`'s `addTable` initialises
   counts to `1`, `seatCustomer` increments). The `WellFormed` predicate
   on `PYPSlot` and `PYPState` and the preservation theorems
   `pypDraw_preserves_wellFormed` (proved via `PYM.Preserves` combinator
   algebra) and `fragmentLambdaDepth_preserves_wellFormed` (induction
   sorry'd, sketch in docstring) capture this invariant. When the
   depth-induction is discharged, this branch can be eliminated by taking
   `(_ : init.WellFormed)` as a hypothesis to `slotToFinpartition` and
   discharging the unreachable case via `absurd`.

The `numCustomers = 0` special case is load-bearing: without it, the
`Composition`-built partition for an empty slot is *not* definitionally
equal to `OrderedFinpartition.atomic 0 = default` (both are unique
inhabitants of `OrderedFinpartition 0` modulo `@[ext]`, but the `partSize`
functions are syntactically distinct: one is `(empty composition).blocksFun`,
the other is constant `1`). Splitting on `numCustomers = 0` keeps the
empty branch defeq to the prior shim, preserving the depth-0 lemma. -/

**Status**:

- `Z` is real (via `LazyTree.collectHaltCounts`).
- `Y` is **faithful for sampler-reachable slots** (via `slotToFinpartition`
  using `Composition.toOrderedFinpartition`): for any slot the sampler
  can produce (where `customerCounts` are all positive — `addTable`
  initialises to `1`, `seatCustomer` increments), the resulting
  `OrderedFinpartition` has the *true* partition structure, and
  `pypFactor` evaluated on it gives its EPPF value. The atomic-fallback
  branch in `slotToFinpartition` is only reached for non-wellformed
  slots (impossible by sampler invariant; future work proves it).
- `D` is real (via `LazyTree.toCFGTree?`): if the tree projects to a complete

/-- **Soundness contract (general — proportionality form).** The marginal
mass the sampler puts at corpus-counts triple `(D, Y, Z)` is *proportional*
to the §3.1.8 density `M.corpusProbGivenStorage D Y Z`, with the same
proportionality constant for all triples. We express this as a ratio
identity (avoiding the partition function): for any two triples the cross-
products of their marginals and densities agree. This is necessary and
sufficient for the marginal to be a normalised version of the density.

**Why ratios rather than equality with a normaliser.** The natural
formulation `marginal D Y Z = ENNReal.ofReal (density D Y Z) / Z(M)`
requires defining `Z(M) = ∑'_(D,Y,Z) density D Y Z` — a sum over function
spaces (`TableAssignment`, `HaltCounts` are function types). Convergence
of this sum is a real-analysis problem (it sums beta/gamma integrals);
the partition function is essentially the marginal likelihood of the
fragment-grammar model, which is itself an open computational problem
([odonnell-2015] §3.2 introduces an MH sampler precisely because
this constant is intractable). The ratio formulation sidesteps `Z(M)`
entirely and captures the proportionality content directly.

**Why this still requires depth-→-∞.** At any finite depth `n`, the
sampler's marginals are *truncated* — supported only on samples that
halt within `n` recursion steps. The §3.1.8 density is the limiting
distribution; at finite depth the marginals only approximately match.
The proof requires:

1. Showing `(λ n, marginal at depth n) → (λ ε, density-up-to-ε)` (the
   depth-truncated marginals converge to the true §3.1.8 marginals as
   `n → ∞`). Almost-sure halting from `recurseProb x < 1` for all `x`
   gives geometric-tail bounds; pass to the limit via dominated
   convergence on `PMF`.
2. PYP exchangeability to handle the operational sampler's order-of-
   customer-arrival vs the §3.1.8 joint distribution's order-agnostic
   claim (see `pypDraw`'s exchangeability caveat).
3. Identifying the limit's marginal at `(D, Y, Z)` with the §3.1.8
   product formula — induction matching each PYP draw to its AG-factor
   contribution and each biased-coin flip to its beta-binomial-ratio
   contribution to `M.fgFactor`.

Step 1 needs probabilistic-fixed-point machinery for monotone PMF-valued
recursions (Knaster–Tarski / Kleene fixed point on ω-CPPOs of sub-
probability measures) absent from mathlib. The right formal home for
this is mathlib's measure-theory or analysis libraries, not linglib.
Steps 2 and 3 are mechanical once Step 1 is in place. -/
