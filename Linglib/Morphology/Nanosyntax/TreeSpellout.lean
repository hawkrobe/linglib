# Nanosyntax: phrasal spellout over feature trees

In nanosyntax a lexical entry pairs an exponent with a stored tree of features, one feature per
node. Caha, after Starke, lets an entry spell out a syntactic tree when the stored tree has a
subtree identical to it, the Superset Principle, which is `RoseTree.IsSubtree`.
When several entries match, the Elsewhere Condition prefers the one that matches in fewer
environments, and since a matching stored tree exceeds the syntactic tree by exactly its
superfluous material, that is the matching entry with the smallest tree. The Foot Condition asks
the lowest feature of a stored tree to occur in what it spells out. Taraldsen's matching relation
instead pairs a node of the stored tree with the root of the syntactic tree and requires their
daughters to match each other both ways; it agrees with containment on right-branching chains,
where tree spellout is also the rank-based spellout of the containment engine.

## Main definitions

* `LexicalEntry`: a stored feature tree paired with an exponent.
* `LexicalEntry.Matches`, `treeSelect`, `treeSpellout`: the Superset Principle and the Elsewhere
  Condition.
* `foot`, `FootConditionMet`: the Foot Condition.
* `Matching`: Taraldsen's matching relation.
* `chainTree`, `LexicalEntry.ofSpanRule`: right-branching chains, and rank-based entries read as
  chain entries.

## Main results

* `LexicalEntry.le_iff`: specificity is reverse containment of the stored trees.
* `treeSelect_isElsewhereWinner`: smallest-tree selection picks an Elsewhere winner.
* `footConditionMet_of_matches_chainTree`: an entry storing a chain meets the Foot Condition
  wherever it matches, so the condition constrains only entries with branching trees.
* `matching_chainTree_iff`, `exists_matching_not_isSubtree`: Taraldsen's matching is containment
  on chains but ignores the order of daughters in general.
* `treeSpellout_ofSpanRule`: on chains, tree spellout is rank-based spellout.

## Implementation notes

* Matching is the rigid Superset Principle of Caha's (6), identity of a subtree; his later Match
  (27), which also ignores traces and spelled-out constituents, needs movement and cyclic
  spellout, which the engine does not represent.
* A node's daughters are ordered with its complement last, so the foot is the last leaf.

## TODO

* The cyclic lexicalization algorithm of later nanosyntax, with spellout-driven movement,
  backtracking and complex specifiers, together with Cyclic Override and Caha's relaxed Match.
