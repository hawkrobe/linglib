# Feature-decomposition exponence and the Subset Principle

The realizational engine for privative **feature-decomposition** accounts of
syncretism ([caha-2009], [bobaljik-2012]): a cell space is decomposed into
feature sets `D : Cell → Finset K`, and a rule applies where its feature
specification is contained in the cell's — the **Subset Principle**. Competition
is [halle-1997]'s feature counting: the applicable rule of greatest
specification wins, as the shared core's `selectBy` on `feats.card`.

Where the linear containment engine (`Exponence/Containment/`) orders spans by a
single threshold, this engine orders arbitrary feature *sets* by inclusion, so
`card`-maximization is genuine specificity only when the applicable
specifications happen to be nested; the general soundness lives in the
`IsWinner` strict-competition predicate rather than the core's linear
`selectBy_isElsewhereWinner`. The linear engine embeds as the chain
decomposition `chainDecomp i = Finset.Iic i` (`Exponence/Containment/Selection.lean`).

## Main declarations

* `Rule` — a feature specification plus an exponent; `Applies` is Subset
  containment
* `pattern` — the surface exponent at each cell, `selectBy` on `feats.card`
* `IsWinner` — strict feature-count competition
* `noABA` — the order-theoretic *ABA exclusion for a cell triple whose
  decomposition nests the middle cell between the outer two

participates in the shared core's Elsewhere selection theory
(`Exponence/Select.lean`). Unlike the linear containment order this is only a
preorder — incomparable specifications (No Case Containment) are the point. -/

/-- ***ABA, order-theoretically**: whenever the middle cell `y` nests between
the outer cells — `D y ⊆ D z` (appliers at `y` persist to `z`) and
`D x ∩ D z ⊆ D y` (appliers at both outer cells reach `y`) — a rule winning both
`x` and `z` also wins `y`, so no exponent can interrupt an A_A pattern with a
distinct middle B. The hypotheses are the shared profile of Strong and Weak Case
Containment; No Case Containment violates the first. -/
