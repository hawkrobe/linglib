# Roots

The formal definition of roothood over `Morph`, relative to a fragment's word
and free-form inventories ([bloomfield-1933], the base definition of
[qin-2025]): a morph is a root iff it occurs in a *primary word* — one with no
free form as a proper part. The definition is deliberately inclusive
(meaning-free cores like *-fer* qualify; so do free function words);
`Studies/Qin2025.lean` grades instances by canonicity, and
[haspelmath-2025b]'s contentfulness-gated alternative is
`Studies/Haspelmath2025b.lean`. Consonantal skeletons are
`ConsonantalRoot`; DM's acategorial root is `DistributedMorphology.Root`
(`Morphology/DistributedMorphology/Defs.lean`).

## Main declarations

* `IsPrimaryWord` — no proper contiguous part is a free form.
* `Morph.IsCoreIn` — the root property: occurrence in a primary word.
* `Morph.IsTypicalAffixIn` — occurrence in secondary words only.
* `IsMinimalFreeForm` — Bloomfield's word, a free form not analyzable into
  free forms.
