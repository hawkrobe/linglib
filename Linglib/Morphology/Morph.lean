# Morphs and exponents

A **morph** is a minimal segmental form together with its attachment kind:
root, prefix, suffix, proclitic, enclitic, or free form ([haspelmath-2020]).
An **exponent** is a possibly empty sequence of morphs realizing a paradigm
cell. Morphs are never zero and never discontinuous: zero exponence is the
empty exponent, and a discontinuous realization is a multi-morph exponent.

## Main declarations

* `Morph`, `Morph.Kind` — a segmental form with its attachment kind,
  factored as side × attachment for bound morphs
* `Exponent` — a sequence of morphs; `[]` is zero exponence
* `Morph.toString`, `Exponent.toString` — descriptive-notation display
  (`X-`, `-X`, `X=`, `=X`; `∅` for zero exponence)
* `Following` — following-segment environment for variant selection

## Implementation notes

[haspelmath-2020] defines a morph as a minimal pairing of content with a
continuous string of segments; the carrier stores only the form side, so
empty and superfluous morphs (Cree connective *-t-*, [anderson-2015] p. 19)
remain representable. `[]` means *no segmental exponent*, not *unmarked*: a
cell whose sole marker is a process (North Saami gradation-only genitives,
[anderson-2015] p. 22) also renders as `[]`. Nonconcatenative exponence
(apophony, reduplication, tone, subtraction) is a process, not a form, and
is out of scope here: `Word.Structure` covers reduplication and conversion,
the autosegmental machinery covers tone.

Boundary notation (`X-`, `-X`, `X=`, `=X`) is display, not data: `Morph.form`
is bare segmental material, and `Morph.toString` reproduces the descriptive
convention from `Morph.Kind`.
