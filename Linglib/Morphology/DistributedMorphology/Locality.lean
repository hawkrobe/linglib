# Locality domains for contextual allomorphy and allosemy

A word is its root with the heads merged above it, innermost first. The
category-defining heads are cyclic: merging one sends the cyclic domains in
its complement to the interfaces, so the heads of a word fall into cycles —
a head's cycle is the number of cyclic heads at or below it — and a head
undergoes Vocabulary Insertion in its own cycle, the material below the first
cyclic head in the first. When a head is spelled out, the heads of its cycle
and of the cycle before are present, the latter already realized, while
earlier material is inactive and later cycles are not yet merged; the root,
in the complement of the first cyclic head, is active in the first cycle only.
Within a cycle each interface adds its own adjacency: a head conditions
another only across heads null at that interface — pruned phonological zeros
for allomorphy, semantically null heads for allosemy — so the two domains
coincide exactly where the two kinds of nullness do. The idiom domain is a
different bound, the heads below an agentive Voice, and neither contains the
other.

## Main definitions

* `Spine`, `Spine.toWordStructure`: the word as root and head sequence, and
  its word-structure tree.
* `Spine.cycle`, `Spine.insertionCycle`: a head's cycle and the cycle of its
  insertion.
* `Spine.Coactive`, `Spine.RootLocal`: presence of one head at another's
  insertion, and of the root.
* `Spine.Sees`, `Spine.SeesRoot`: presence plus adjacency across heads null at
  an interface.
* `Spine.IdiomLocal`: the heads below an agentive Voice.

## Main results

* `cycle_mono`, `RootLocal.of_le`: cycles grow outward and the root's domain is
  an initial segment.
* `not_rootLocal_of_cyclic_of_cyclic`, `RootLocal.cyclic_first`: an outer
  cyclic head is not local to the root, and a local cyclic head is the first.
* `not_coactive_of_lt_of_cyclic`, `not_coactive_of_cyclic_of_cyclic`: nothing
  sees an outer cyclic head — no outward sensitivity to, and no fusion with,
  a later category head.
* `not_coactive_of_add_two_le`: material two cycles down is inactive.
* `not_sees_of_not_null`, `sees_congr`: an intervening non-null head blocks
  conditioning, and the interface domains agree where nullness agrees.
