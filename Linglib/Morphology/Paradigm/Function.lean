# The PFM1 paradigm function

This file defines the standard Paradigm Function Morphology engine, Bonami and Stump's
streamlined PFM1 after Stump's original engine. A paradigm function is a set of **realization
rules** organized into ordered **blocks**. A rule `⟨klass, props, payload⟩` applies to a cell
`⟨L, σ⟩` when the lexeme `L` belongs to `klass` and the property set `props` is contained in
`σ`, and among the applicable rules of a block the narrowest wins, by Kiparsky's Elsewhere
Condition (PFM's Pāṇinian Determinism). One payload-polymorphic carrier `Rule L P F` serves all
three rule types: rules of exponence and referral take `F := Action Z P`, rules of basic stem
choice take `F := Z`, and the same narrowness order arbitrates stem-choice conflicts.

Narrowness (`Rule`'s `≤`) has the two clauses of Stump's original engine: same class with a
larger property set, or a properly smaller class. It is intensional. For same-class rules it
collapses to applicability-set inclusion (`applySet_mono`), but across classes a smaller class
outranks a larger one whatever the property sets, so the order is strictly finer than the
extensional domain-subset order of `Exponence/Basic.lean`, which Stump's later books adopt; his
encyclopedia overview of PFM likewise glosses "narrowest" as the smaller domain of application.

The **Identity Function Default**, a rule in every block leaving the stem unchanged, is assumed
as a universal principle in PFM; here it is a definition (`identityDefault`) whose consequences
are theorems (it is `≤`-maximal, and a block containing it always selects). As in Bonami and
Stump's presentation, two implicative devices are kept distinct. A **rule of referral**
(`Action.referral`) models block-confined syncretism and competes inside its block; whole-word
syncretism lives a layer up, as a many-to-one property mapping in `Linkage.pm`
(`Linkage.realized_eq_of_corr_eq`), where Stump's overview relocates it, and
paradigm-function-level override clauses are not modeled. Overabundance (one cell, several
forms) is out of scope, since the realized paradigm is function-valued. Morphophonological
metageneralizations (the `-a`-loss and umlaut rules of the Icelandic fragment) are phonological
substance and live in `Phonology/`; here stem alternants like *köll* enter as data-level stem
values, not string operations.

Because payloads are functions, `Exponence.Coherent` and `Realizes` over `Action Z P` are
`funext` propositions rather than decidable checks; a study decides realized values, not
payload equality.

## Main definitions

* `Action`, `Rule`: the payload (exponence or referral) and the payload-polymorphic
  realization rule, with its `Exponence.Rule` and two-clause narrowness `Preorder` instances.
* `identityDefault`: the Identity Function Default.
* `evalBlock`, `paradigmFunction`, `stemChoiceOf`: narrowest-rule block evaluation and the
  block cascade.
* `evalPortmanteau`, `functionCompositionDefault`: portmanteau blocks, and the Function
  Composition Default as a derived `≤`-maximal rule.

## Main results

* `Rule.applies_iff`, `Rule.le_iff`, `Rule.applySet_mono`: applicability and narrowness.
* `le_identityDefault`, `selectMinimal_isSome_of_mem_identityDefault`: the IFD is `≤`-maximal,
  and a block containing it always selects.
* `evalPortmanteau_eq_comp_of_not_applies`: the Function Composition Default.
* `selectMinimal_append_maximal`: appending a maximal always-applicable rule is
  elsewhere-only, the mechanism behind `identityDefault` and the FCD.
* `evalPortmanteau_eq_functionCompositionDefault`: the stipulated portmanteau evaluation
  equals its appended-block form.
* `Linkage.realized_eq_paradigmFunction`, `Linkage.ofFun_realized_eq_paradigmFunction`: the
  PFM2 realization of a linkage's block cascade is this paradigm function.

variable {L Z P F : Type*}

/-- The payload of a realization rule is an action. A rule of **exponence**
carries a form operation `f : P → Z → Z` that may consult the realized property
set, and a rule of **referral** carries a property-set retargeting `P → P` whose
block is re-consulted at the retargeted cell. The property argument makes the form
operation σ-sensitive, as [stump-2020]'s rule format allows (his conditional
affixation operator for ambifixal classes consults σ), and lets the Function
Composition Default carry a rule whose action is "evaluate two blocks at the
current cell". -/

`F := Action Z P` and rules of basic stem choice `F := Z`. `klass` is the lexeme

block-straddling device; [stump-2020] supersedes it with **rule conflation** (a

/-! ### The Function Composition Default as a derived rule -/

section FunctionCompositionDefault
variable [Fintype L] [OrderBot P]

/-- The **Function Composition Default** as a derived rule ([spencer-2013]) is the
rule of a portmanteau block `[m, n]` whose σ-sensitive action evaluates block `n`
and then block `m` at the current cell. Like `identityDefault` it applies
everywhere (`klass = univ`, `props = ⊥`) and is `≤`-maximal, so any explicit
portmanteau rule, being narrower, preempts it by ordinary Pāṇinian narrowness. [spencer-2013]
observes that an explicit portmanteau rule is by definition more specific than
the FCD, so ordinary narrowness suffices to order them; this derives what
`evalPortmanteau` stipulates, the same stipulate-to-derive upgrade
`identityDefault` gives the Identity Function Default. -/
def functionCompositionDefault (Lindex : Z → L) (bm bn : Block L Z P) :
    Rule L P (Action Z P) where
  klass := Finset.univ
  props := ⊥

/-- For a portmanteau block `bmn` of rules of exponence, the stipulated
`evalPortmanteau` equals the block `bmn ++ [fcd]` evaluated as an ordinary
block. Where a portmanteau rule applies it wins by
narrowness (`le_functionCompositionDefault`, via `selectMinimal_append_maximal`);
where none does, the appended FCD fires and evaluates `bm ∘ bn` at the cell. This
certifies the stipulated Function Composition Default as [stump-2020]'s
single-block rule-conflation reading of [bonami-stump-2016]'s block-straddling
device. The exponence-only hypothesis on `bmn` is what a portmanteau block *is*
in PFM, since referral, a separate syncretism device, re-selects over the block's
`expoFragment`, which the appended (exponence-shaped) FCD would perturb. -/
