# Morphomes: syncretism classes with no natural characterization

A realization map `p : Cell → F` assigns a form to each paradigm cell. Its
**syncretism** relation — cells receiving the same form — is exactly
mathlib's kernel setoid `Setoid.ker p`, and the syncretism classes are its
equivalence classes. A **morphome** ([aronoff-1994] coined the term) is a
systematic syncretism that does not define a natural class; [herce-2023]
adopts the working definition "a systematic morphological syncretism which
does not define a (syntactically or semantically) natural class" (Trommer
2016, quoted approvingly).

Naturalness is a **parameter** `Natural : Set Cell → Prop`, not stipulated
here. [herce-2023] operationalizes a natural class as one "coextensive with
a value (e.g. SG) or conjunction of values (e.g. 1SG)" and treats
naturalness as *gradient*, so `Natural` is best read as a threshold slice of
that scale; the value-or-conjunction predicate is its canonical
instantiation, `IsValueConjunction`: the cells agreeing with some cell on
some of the paradigm's features, each feature given as the partition of
cells it induces.
Systematicity — recurrence of the pattern under more than one exponent or
allomorph — is a separate criterion the consumer establishes.

Two limitations, per [baerman-2015]'s three-way analysis space for
syncretism (morphosyntactic identity / underspecification / morphological
stipulation, p. 146): an **elsewhere** form's fiber is typically also
nontrivial and non-natural (one specified cell, the default covers the
unnatural rest — Skou, p. 145), so `IsMorphome` is necessary but not
sufficient for stipulation-hood; distinguishing the two needs opposition
structure or the systematicity criterion above. And **directional**
syncretism (a cell wearing another cell's form "in place of the expected"
one, p. 142) is invisible to the symmetric kernel.

The vocabulary here is deliberately just "morphome": [herce-2023] rejects
Round's rhizomorphome ~ metamorphome ~ meromorphome subdivision as needless
jargon, and "metasyncretism" does not appear in the book.

## Main declarations

* `Morphology.syncretism` — the syncretism setoid of a realization map
  (`Setoid.ker`)
* `Morphology.syncretismClass` — the class (fiber) of a given cell
* `Morphology.formCells` — the cells a form realizes, the `Finset` face of the class
* `Morphology.IsMorphome` — a nontrivial syncretism class failing `Natural`
* `Morphology.IsValueConjunction` — the cells agreeing with a witness on a set of features,
  [herce-2023]'s natural class

more than one cell (`Set.Nontrivial`) yet is not a `Natural` class — a

/-! ### Natural classes as value conjunctions

[herce-2023] takes a natural class to be one "coextensive with a value or conjunction of
values". A paradigm's features are the partitions of its cells they induce, the kernels of
the feature projections; a value conjunction is then the set of cells agreeing with some cell
on some of the features. -/

the cells agreeing with some cell on some of the features. -/

the witness cell. -/

/-! ### Shared exponents in segmented realizations

Whole-form kernels cannot see a *piece* shared across cells whose full
forms differ (a suffix shared by two segmented stems, like Chuj -aj
inside *-chaj* and *-waj*).
For a realization map valued in exponent sequences, `exponentCells`
tracks a piece's distribution; whether that distribution is a natural
class is then the same question `IsMorphome` asks of whole-form
classes. -/

variable {E : Type*}

/-- The cells whose segmented realization contains the exponent `e` —
the piece-level analogue of `syncretismClass`. -/

@[simp] theorem mem_exponentCells {p : Cell → List E} {e : E} {c : Cell} :
    c ∈ exponentCells p e ↔ e ∈ p c := Iff.rfl

/-- Wholly syncretic cells agree on every shared exponent. -/

    (h : p c₁ = p c₂) : c₁ ∈ exponentCells p e ↔ c₂ ∈ exponentCells p e := by
