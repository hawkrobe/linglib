# Schwab2022: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/Schwab2022.json` by `scripts/gen_experiments.py`.

Two speeded acceptability experiments on the German NPIs jemals 'ever' and so recht 'really', each
crossing the NPI with the position of a negative quantifier: in the matrix clause, inside a relative
clause, or absent. For each experiment the paper reports Bayes factors, from bridge sampling,
comparing a model with the NPI illusion of each NPI, or with the interaction of the two illusions,
to a model without it, and reads each as evidence of a stated strength. The posterior estimates are
not recorded; Experiment 1 prints the estimate of the so recht illusion with the numbers of the
jemals illusion, although its posterior in Figure 2 is centred near zero.
