A norming study and two inference-endorsement experiments on indirect illusory inferences from
disjunction. The norming study rated the strength of the causal link in conditionals of three kinds:
the crucial dependence from the hint d to the conjunct a, and the control dependences a-to-b and
d-to-b; item 0 was removed after the control block showed an effect driven by it. Experiment 1
presented problems of the form (a and b) or c; d, therefore b; Experiment 2 moved the causal step to
the conclusion: (b and d) or c; b, therefore a. Acceptance of the fallacy is regressed on the normed
strength of the d-to-a link; coefficients, control rates and the binomial model are recorded as
printed.
