# MaldonadoCulbertson2022: experimental results (generated)

Experiment 2: English-speaking participants learned an artificial pronoun system with three plural
forms for four plural person categories, first exclusive, inclusive, second and third, the inclusive
sharing its form with the first exclusive (First-inclusive), the second (Second-inclusive) or the
third person (Third-inclusive), between subjects. Accuracy in the second testing block was analysed
by logistic mixed-effects models with treatment coding, first with First-inclusive and then with
Second-inclusive as the baseline; the intercept compares the baseline's accuracy with chance.
