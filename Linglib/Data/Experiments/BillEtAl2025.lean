# BillEtAl2025: experimental results (generated)

An act-out comprehension study of the three conjunctive expressions of Georgian and of Hungarian, J,
MU and J-MU, with children and adults. Each trial showed three objects and a sentence saying that
two of them are on the table; the two measures were accuracy, whether the end state matched the
exhaustified sentence, and sentence-played-n, how often the sentence was replayed. Tables 1, 2, 4
and 5 print the likelihood-ratio tests of the fixed effects, Table 3 the Tukey follow-up contrasts
among the Georgian sentence types, and footnote 12 the kinds of error the Georgian children made.
