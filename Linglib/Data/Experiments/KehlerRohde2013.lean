# KehlerRohde2013: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/KehlerRohde2013.json` by `scripts/gen_experiments.py`.
Do not edit by hand: edit the JSON and re-run the generator.

The passage-completion results the paper synthesizes from the authors' earlier experiments: an
aspect manipulation, an instruction manipulation, a prompt manipulation and a voice manipulation,
each reporting proportions of Source interpretations, coherence relations, next mentions or
pronominalized references. Proportions are printed to two places; the paper prints the Violated
Expectation relation as Violated Exp in Tables 3, 4 and 6. The first-mention rates of the prompt
manipulation are printed in the text, not in a table.
