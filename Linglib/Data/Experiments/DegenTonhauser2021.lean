# DegenTonhauser2021: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/DegenTonhauser2021.json` by
`scripts/gen_experiments.py`. Do not edit by hand: edit the JSON and re-run the generator.

Two experiments testing whether listeners' prior beliefs in the content of a clausal complement
modulate its projection, over twenty clause-embedding predicates and twenty contents, each content
paired with a fact expected to raise or lower its prior probability. Experiment 1 measured the prior
probability of the contents and the certainty that the speaker of a polar question is committed to
them within participants; Experiments 2a and 2b measured the two on separate groups. The by-content
prior means and by-predicate certainty means are plotted, not tabulated.

## Raw data

* <https://github.com/judith-tonhauser/projective-probability>: materials, trial-level data and
  analysis code of both experiments (footnote 3); the means are recomputed from results/9-prior-
  projection/data/cd.csv (Exp. 1), results/1-prior/data/cd.csv (Exp. 2a) and
  results/3-projectivity/data/cd.csv (Exp. 2b), which already apply the paper's participant
  exclusions
