# RonderosEtAl2024: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/RonderosEtAl2024.json` by
`scripts/gen_experiments.py`. Do not edit by hand: edit the JSON and re-run the generator.

A visual-world experiment in the paradigm of [sedivy-etal-1999] with speakers of English, Hindi and
Hungarian: a four-object display is previewed for three seconds, a definite description with a
colour, material or scalar adjective follows, and the participant clicks on its referent. CONDITION
(Contrast, No-Contrast) is run in two blocks and crossed with ADJECTIVE TYPE. Fixations are analysed
over the noun window, time-locked to noun onset and offset by 200 ms: by a cluster-based permutation
test on target looks and by a mixed model of the target-advantage score, for the effect of condition
within each adjective type; the looks to target and competitor together in the No-Contrast condition
are modelled with scalar adjectives as the intercept. Language is a grouping unit of the models, so
the statistics are pooled over the three languages. The interaction cluster and the control model of
the time before the noun are not recorded.
