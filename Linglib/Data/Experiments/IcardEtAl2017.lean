# IcardEtAl2017: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/IcardEtAl2017.json` by `scripts/gen_experiments.py`.

Two 2 (causal structure) x 2 (norm violation) x 4 (vignette) between-subjects experiments in which
participants rated, on a 1 to 7 scale, their agreement that the varied agent caused the outcome.
Experiment 1 varies a prescriptive norm, Experiment 2 a statistical one. The tables record the
participant counts and the condition means and standard deviations printed for each causal
structure, collapsed over the four vignettes; the by-vignette means are only plotted (Figures A1 and
B1). Section numbers are those of the accepted preprint (PsyArXiv g7cqk).
