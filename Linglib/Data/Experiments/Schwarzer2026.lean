# Schwarzer2026: experimental results (generated)

Two experiments on German DP-CP coordination. Experiment 1 rated bare dass-clauses and DP-CP
coordinations after verbs that do and do not select a clause, on a five-point scale z-scored per
participant; table (14) prints the descriptive statistics of the four conditions. Experiment 2 was a
forced choice between the DP-first and the CP-first order of a coordination in preverbal and in
postverbal position.

## Raw data

* <https://osf.io/kznyt/>: materials, scripts, plots and trial-level data of both experiments; table
  (14) is recomputed from data/accept.csv and the choices from data/2afc.csv
