# Khoo2015: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/Khoo2015.json` by `scripts/gen_experiments.py`.

The experiment of section II: participants read a control vignette with a non-modal assertion and a
modal vignette in which Smith says 'Fat Tony might be dead' while the participant knows him to be
alive, and rated on a seven-point scale either whether what the speaker said is false or whether
they would reject it with 'No, ...'. Footnote 13 prints the mean and standard deviation of each
cell. The released survey has 31 participants in the False condition and 30 in the Rejection
condition, 61 against the paper's sixty, which the t-tests' degrees of freedom (59 between the
conditions, 30 within the False one) agree with.
