# Bruening2025: experimental results (generated)

Three acceptability surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk, rated on a scale from 1 (extremely unnatural)
to 5 (extremely natural). Experiment 1a compared non-ly adverbs and adjectives before a noun,
Experiment 1b a clause alone and a clause coordinated with a noun phrase where only noun phrases are
selected, the two serving as each other's fillers; Experiment 2 repeated 1a with one-replacement,
which rules out a compound parse.
