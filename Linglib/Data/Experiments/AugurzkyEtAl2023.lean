# AugurzkyEtAl2023: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/AugurzkyEtAl2023.json` by
`scripts/gen_experiments.py`. Do not edit by hand: edit the JSON and re-run the generator.

Two web-based picture-sentence verification experiments with a plural definite bound by a
quantifier, 'Every boy opened his presents' against 'No boy opened his presents' (Experiment 1) and
against 'Not every boy opened his presents' (Experiment 2). Each picture shows four boys with nine
presents each, opened ones coloured and closed ones grey. CONTEXT, a family rule that the presents
be opened before the neighbours arrive (UNIVERSAL) or not before the grandparents arrive
(EXISTENTIAL), is between subjects and is reinforced by a secondary task asking whether the rule was
respected; TRUTH VALUE (true, false, mixed) and POLARITY (every against the negative quantifier) are
within subjects. Participants rated how well the sentence described the picture on a five-point
scale from 'completely false' to 'completely true'. The mixed conditions are analysed by cumulative
logistic mixed-effects models with CONTEXT sum-coded and POLARITY treatment-coded with the negative
quantifier as baseline, and random by-subject intercepts and slopes; CONTEXT is reported recoded as
Lax (EXISTENTIAL for every, UNIVERSAL for the negative quantifier) or Strict. The paper reports the
tests of the effects, not the cell means, which appear only in Figures 3 and 5.
