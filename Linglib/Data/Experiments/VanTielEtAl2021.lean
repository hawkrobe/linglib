The quantity words of the production study and their monotonicity. In Experiment 1, participants
completed the frame '— of the circles are red' for displays of 432 red or black circles; the
seventeen words modelled are the fifteen produced 50 times or more, together with 'all' and 'none'.
In Experiment 2, 120 participants judged the validity of inferences from 'Q of the people P1' to 'Q
of the people P2' and back, for predicate pairs in which P1 entails P2. A word was coded nonmonotone
if neither inference was accepted more than half the time, and otherwise by whether it clustered
with 'all' (monotone increasing) or with 'none' (monotone decreasing); no word was coded
nonmonotone. The coding fixes whether the generalized-quantifier lexicon gives a word a lower or an
upper threshold.
