# TonhauserBeaverDegen2018: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/TonhauserBeaverDegen2018.json` by

Four rating experiments on the projectivity and at-issueness of 19 projective contents of American
English: the content of 9 syntactically heterogeneous expressions (Experiments 1a and 2a) and of the
clausal complements of 12 attitude predicates (Experiments 1b and 2b). Experiments 1a and 1b
measured projectivity by the certain-that question and at-issueness by the asking-whether question
on a no-yes slider, each stimulus a polar question; responses were coded so that 1 is projecting and
not-at-issue. Experiments 2a and 2b re-measured at-issueness by an Are-you-sure dissent diagnostic
on indicative stimuli. The by-expression means are plotted, not tabulated; the paper prints the
mixed-effects estimates, the correlations, two Tukey pairwise-comparison tables and a summary table.

## Raw data

* <https://github.com/judith-tonhauser/how-projective>: materials, trial-level data and analysis
  scripts of all four experiments (footnote 8); the by-expression means and the main-clause controls
  are recomputed from results/exp1a/data/data_preprocessed.csv and
  results/exp1b/data/data_preprocessed.csv, which already apply the paper's participant exclusions
