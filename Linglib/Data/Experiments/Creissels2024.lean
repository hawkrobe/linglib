# Creissels2024: experimental results (generated)

The survey figures Creissels reports from Bahrt (2021: 144): the percentage of the languages of a
222-language sample, all of different genera, in which synthetic marking of each of seven types of
voice alternation is attested, analytic marking excluded.
