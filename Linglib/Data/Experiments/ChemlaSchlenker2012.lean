# ChemlaSchlenker2012: experimental results (generated)

Five experiments on French sentences with the anaphoric trigger aussi ('too') in if-, or- and
unless-sentences, in the canonical order, where the clause that can satisfy the presupposition
precedes the trigger, and the inverse order, where it follows. Experiments 1 and 4 collected
inferential judgments, rating on a continuous scale from no to yes whether the conditional or the
unconditional presupposition follows from a sentence; Experiments 2, 3 and 5 collected acceptability
judgments, with control sentences for local accommodation with too and with the, a justified
presupposition and no presupposition. Experiments 1 and 2 were run on one group of participants, 3
and 4 on a second, and 5, with complex fillers, on a third (Table 3). The tables print means and,
for the inferential experiments, one-way ANOVAs comparing the two inferences; standard errors are
shown only as error bars and are not recorded.
