# RosaArnold2017: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/RosaArnold2017.json` by `scripts/gen_experiments.py`.

The pronoun rates of the three production experiments, an in-person event retelling, a sentence
completion over the story materials, and a sentence completion with disconnected items, by the
continued character's thematic role, its grammatical role, and whether the two characters share a
gender, with the next-mention rating study over the Experiment 1 stimuli. Page numbers are those of
the authors' accepted manuscript.
