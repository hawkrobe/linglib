# RuytenbeekEtAl2017: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/RuytenbeekEtAl2017.json` by
`scripts/gen_experiments.py`. Do not edit by hand: edit the JSON and re-run the generator.

A corpus count of two French interrogative requests and two eye-tracking studies in which
participants heard a sentence about a grid of shapes and either answered it with a yes/no (Study 1)
or true/false (Study 2) button or moved the shape it mentions. The response times are mixed-model
estimates with 95% confidence intervals; the interpretations table records the paper's verbal
findings, since the response proportions and fixation durations are only plotted, in figures this
manuscript does not contain. Page numbers are those of the authors' manuscript.

## Raw data
