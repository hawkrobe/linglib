# BeltramaSchwarz2024: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/BeltramaSchwarz2024.json` by
`scripts/gen_experiments.py`. Do not edit by hand: edit the JSON and re-run the generator.

Two experiments on American English round numerals, with the speaker described as Nerdy, as Chill,
or not at all (between subjects), crossed with Screen Fit (within subjects): the number on a visible
phone screen matched the uttered one, diverged from it largely, or diverged slightly (Imprecise).
Experiment 1 (Covered Screen) asked which phone the speaker was looking at, a covered choice
rejecting the visible one; Experiment 2 (Truth Value Judgment) showed the screen the speaker looked
at and asked whether the answer was right. Rejection is a covered choice or a wrong judgment.
