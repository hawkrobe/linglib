# AbramskySadrzadeh2014: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/AbramskySadrzadeh2014.json` by
`scripts/gen_experiments.py`. Do not edit by hand: edit the JSON and re-run the generator.

The corpus frequencies behind the paper's probabilistic anaphora example (John gave the bananas to
the monkeys. They were ripe. They were cheeky.): the British News corpus counts of the four
adjective-noun patterns, and the printed distribution over the four candidate gluings. Locations are
sections of the arXiv preprint (1403.3351v1).
