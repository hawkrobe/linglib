# DegenTonhauser2022: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/DegenTonhauser2022.json` by

Six experiments on the content of the clausal complement of twenty English clause-embedding
predicates, crossing three diagnostics with two response tasks: projection by the certain-that
diagnostic on polar questions (Experiments 1a and 1b), and entailment by the inference diagnostic on
true statements (2a and 2b) and by the contradictoriness diagnostic on utterances that go on to deny
the complement (3a and 3b). The by-predicate means are plotted, not tabulated; for each experiment
the paper prints which predicates a Bayesian mixed-effects regression did not distinguish from the
reference controls.

## Raw data

* <https://github.com/judith-tonhauser/projective-probability>: materials, trial-level data and
  analysis code of all six experiments (footnote 14); the means are recomputed from
  results/5-projectivity-no-fact/data/cd.csv (1a) and results/8-projectivity-no-fact-
  binary/data/cd.csv (1b), which already apply the paper's participant exclusions
