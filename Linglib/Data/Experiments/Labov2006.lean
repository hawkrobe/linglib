# Labov2006: experimental results (generated)

Auto-generated from `Linglib/Data/Experiments/Labov2006.json` by `scripts/gen_experiments.py`.
Do not edit by hand: edit the JSON and re-run the generator.

Labov's printed tables from the second edition of the New York City survey: (r) and stops in
*fourth* in the department store survey, the class stratification of the five phonological variables
by class group and contextual style, the distributions in apparent time of /ʌy/, (r), (æh), (oh),
(th) and (dh) by age and class or ethnic group, and the (ing) index by age, social class and style.
