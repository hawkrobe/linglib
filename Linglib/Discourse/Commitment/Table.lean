# The Table

This file defines the context structure of [farkas-bruce-2010]: the participants' discourse
commitments, the common ground, and the Table, a stack of the issues under discussion with the
most recent on top. A declarative raises its proposition as an issue, `Question.ofSet p`, and a
polar interrogative raises `Question.polar p`; the complete answers of an issue are its
alternatives, `Question.alt`, the interrogative denotation of [karttunen-1977], and a common
ground decides an issue when it entails one of them. Each issue on the Table projects the common
grounds that would decide it, and the projected set is derived from the common ground and the
stack. The moves of the paper are functions on the structure, and the file proves what each does
to the projected set, the commitment lists, and the Table. Parenthesized numbers are the paper's
example and definition numbers.

A Table is a discourse state in both projections: its common ground is the `commonGround`
coordinate (`HasCommonGround`) and its current issue is the top of the stack
(`Discourse.HasIssue`). It is not a `HasAssertion` instance under its own `assert`, which leaves
the common ground alone and moves only the projected set.

## Main definitions

* `Question.DecidedBy P f`: the common ground `f` entails a complete answer of the issue `P`.
* `Commitment.Table A W`: the context structure, with `Table.discourseCommitments a` the
  propositions `a` has publicly committed to and `Table.projectedSet` the projected set, the
  fold of the paper's `ps ∪ P` over the stack.
* `Table.IsStable`: the Table is empty.
* `Table.InCrisis`: the common ground is inconsistent or no projected common ground is.
* `Table.Shared`: every participant is committed to the proposition.
* `Table.assert`, `Table.polarQuestion`, `Table.settle`, `Table.agreeToDisagree`: the
  default assertion (9), which commits its author as in [gunlogson-2001], the default polar
  question (12), the common-ground increasing operation M' (17), and agreeing to disagree (23).
  Assertion confirmation (16) is `Table.commit` of the proposition on top of the Table, and
  total denial (22) is `assert` of its negation.

## Main results

* `Table.le_commonGround_of_mem_projectedSet`, `Table.decidedBy_of_mem_projectedSet_of_mem_stack`: a
  projected common ground refines the current one and decides every issue on the Table.
* `Table.inCrisis_iff`: with the projected set derived, crisis is having no consistent
  projected common ground; the inconsistent-common-ground clause is subsumed.
* `Table.projectedSet_assert_assert_compl`, `Table.inCrisis_assert_assert_compl`: a denied
  assertion projects nothing consistent (21) and leaves the conversation in crisis.
* `Table.settle_push_of_decidedBy`, `Table.settle_assert_self`,
  `Table.discourseCommitments_settle`: M' pops the issues the new common ground decides and
  strips the shared proposition from every commitment list.
* `Table.agreeToDisagree_assert_assert`, `Table.inCrisis_agreeToDisagree_assert_assert`:
  agreeing to disagree keeps the commitments, restores the Table, and restores the crisis
  status of the input context (23).

## Implementation notes

* The paper notes that the projected set can always be rebuilt from the common ground and the
  Table, so it is derived rather than stored.
* A common ground is a filter of propositions, so a proposition follows from it when it belongs
  to the filter. This is the intersection-based entailment the paper's footnote 8 sets aside as
  too coarse-grained: here every necessary proposition is decided by every common ground, and
  `Question.decidedBy_top` records that the trivial issue is always decided.
* M' (17) applies in the paper only once the proposition is on every commitment list;
  `Table.settle` is the operation itself, and the trigger is a hypothesis on the caller,
  `Table.Shared`. Its popping clause is read as "pop from the top while decided", which
  follows the stack wording of (17) and agrees with the paper's examples; the gloss after
  (17) can also be read as removing every decided item from anywhere in the stack, and the
  clause pops on an entailed complete answer where the gloss says a decided one, which differ
  for a declarative whose negation the new common ground entails. Whether a common ground
  entails a complete answer is not decidable, so `Table.settle` is classical and
  noncomputable.
* Agreeing to disagree requires a denial on top of the assertion it denies, which is where
  total denial (22) leaves the Table, and removes both; `Table.agreeToDisagree` pops twice and
  does not check the precondition.
