# Rising and falling declaratives

[gunlogson-2001] represents a two-party context as the pair of the participants' commitment
sets, the worlds compatible with each one's public beliefs (60), and reads a declarative's
intonation as choosing whose commitment set its content updates: falling for the speaker's,
rising for the addressee's (77), (78). Which participant is committed to what defines the
statuses of a proposition — a commitment of a participant, a joint commitment, resolved,
controversial — and the bias of a context toward it (63)–(68). [gunlogson-2008] refines the
addressee's commitment under a rising declarative as attributed by the speaker rather than
self-generated, the `Commitment.Source` coordinate.

## Main definitions

* `Commitment.commitmentSet` — `cs_X` (60).
* `Commitment.falling`, `Commitment.rising` — (78), (77).
* `Commitment.IsCommitmentOf`, `IsJoint`, `IsResolved`, `IsControversial`, `IsBiased`,
  `IsNeutral` — (63)–(68).

## Main results

* `Commitment.commitmentSet_falling`, `Commitment.commitmentSet_rising` — each intonation
  narrows exactly one commitment set.
* `Commitment.isBiased_falling`, `Commitment.isBiased_rising` — a declarative in a neutral,
  unresolved context biases it toward its content.
* `Commitment.IsResolved.isNeutral` — a resolved context is neutral under (68), since (66) makes
  a resolved proposition controversial for no one.
