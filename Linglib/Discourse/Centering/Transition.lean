# Centering theory: transitions

Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein classify the move from one utterance to the next by whether the
backward-looking center is kept and, if so, whether it is the preferred center: continuation,
retaining, or shifting. Rule 2 orders the three, continuation first, and prefers sequences of
earlier transitions to sequences of later ones. This file classifies a pair of utterances from
its centers, scans a discourse for the centers and transitions of each utterance after the
first, and carries Rule 2's order as the `LinearOrder` on `Transition`.

## Main declarations

* `Discourse.Centering.Transition`: the three transition types, linearly ordered by Rule 2.
* `Transition.ofCenters`: the transition determined by the prior center, the current center, and
  the current preferred center.
* `Discourse.Centering.transition`: the transition into an utterance from the previous one,
  given the prior center.
* `Discourse.Centering.cbs` and `transitions`: the centers and transitions along a discourse.

## Implementation notes

The paper's definitions presuppose a prior backward-looking center. When there is none, as for
the second utterance of a segment, the center counts as kept, so the utterance continues or
retains according to whether its center is its preferred center: the proposal of Walker, Iida,
and Cote that [poesio-stevenson-eugenio-hitzeman-2004] reports, on which the first utterance's
center is underspecified until the second is processed. An utterance with no backward-looking
center shifts, as the paper's shifting clause reads when the center is undefined.

Rule 2 prefers sequences of continuations to sequences of retentions and those to sequences of
shifts, and in particular prefers a pair of continuations to a pair of retentions. The order on
`Transition` is its content on single transitions; a study compares sequences by that order
pointwise.
