# Forward- and backward-looking centers

Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein's centering theory tracks the entities an utterance is about. An
utterance realizes entities in grammatical roles; its forward-looking centers are those entities
ranked by role, the first of them its preferred center, and its backward-looking center is the
highest-ranked forward-looking center of the previous utterance that it realizes. Rule 1 says
that if the utterance pronominalizes any forward-looking center of the previous one, it
pronominalizes its backward-looking center.

## Main declarations

* `Discourse.Centering.Realization` and `Discourse.Centering.Utterance`: a noun phrase realizing
  an entity in a role, by a pronoun or not, and an utterance as its realizations in surface
  order. `e ∈ u` says that `u` realizes `e`.
* `Utterance.ranked`, `Utterance.cf`, `Utterance.cp`: the realizations in rank order, the
  forward-looking centers, and the preferred center.
* `Discourse.Centering.cb`: the backward-looking center, for any current utterance with
  decidable membership, characterized by `cb_eq_some_iff` and `role_le_of_cb`.
* `Discourse.Centering.PronominalizationConstraint` and `CbPronominalized`: Rule 1 and Gordon,
  Grosz, and Gilliom's unconditional strengthening of it.

## Implementation notes

The ranking of forward-looking centers is a `LinearOrder` on the role type, higher meaning more
prominent; two realizations in the same role tie, and the sort is stable, so ties keep surface
order. An entity realized twice is listed twice among the forward-looking centers, which leaves
the backward-looking center, the preferred center, and Rule 1 unaffected.

The current utterance of `cb` is any type with decidable entity membership, so that a study can
let an utterance realize an entity indirectly, as in [poesio-stevenson-eugenio-hitzeman-2004].
