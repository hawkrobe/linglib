# Centering theory: ranking by grammatical role

The ranking of forward-looking centers that centering theory assumes for English: the subject
outranks the object, which outranks every other role. Kameyama argued for grammatical role over
Sidner's focus-based ranking, Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein adopt it in their examples, and Gordon,
Grosz, and Gilliom's repeated-name penalty experiments support it.

## Main declarations

* `Discourse.Centering.GrammaticalRole`: subject, object, and other, linearly ordered in that
  order of prominence.
* `GrammaticalRole.ofArgumentRole`: the role of a comparative coding slot under an accusative
  alignment, the hom from `ArgumentRole` that connects the ranking to the clause
  vocabulary.
