# Coherence relations

This file defines the coherence relations of [kehler-2002], the ways two adjacent discourse
segments are understood to connect, and their classification into the three kinds of connection
between ideas Hume distinguished: resemblance, cause–effect, and contiguity. The classes differ in
the inference that establishes the relation. A resemblance relation aligns the predicates and
arguments of the two segments and compares them; a cause–effect relation infers a proposition from
each segment and connects the two by an implication; a contiguity relation reads the second
segment's eventuality as continuing from the end state of the first. A cause–effect relation is
oriented by which segment supplies the cause, and the orientation is defined on exactly that
class (`Relation.causalDirection_isSome_iff`), so Explanation is Result with the segments
exchanged, and Denial of Preventer is Violated Expectation with the segments exchanged.

## Main definitions

* `Discourse.Coherence.Class`: resemblance, cause–effect, or contiguity.
* `Discourse.Coherence.Relation`: the eleven relations, with `Relation.toClass`.
* `Discourse.Coherence.Direction`, `Relation.causalDirection`: which segment a cause–effect
  relation takes as the cause.
