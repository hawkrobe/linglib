# Speech acts

This file defines the illocutionary force of an utterance and the preparatory conditions of a
request for information. The force is the act an utterance performs, the F in F(p): asserting,
asking, commanding, promising or exclaiming. Each sentence type conventionally performs one
force, `Clause.SentenceType.force`, the three interrogatives all asking, and a form used for
another act, a rising declarative that asks or an interrogative that requests, is a mismatch
between that pairing and the act. Lakoff assigns each force the participant with epistemic
authority over its content, the addressee for a question and the speaker otherwise. A speech
act is felicitous only if its preparatory conditions hold, as Searle observes; for a request,
that the addressee is able to do what is requested. The preparatory conditions of a request for
information, in the inventory of Francik and Clark, are the obstacles a speaker may see to
getting the information, partially ordered by specificity.

## Main definitions

* `Discourse.SpeechAct.Force`, `Discourse.SpeechAct.Force.authority`: the forces and Lakoff's
  epistemic authority.
* `Clause.SentenceType.force`: the force a sentence type conventionally performs.
* `Discourse.SpeechAct.PreparatoryCondition`, with its `PartialOrder`.
