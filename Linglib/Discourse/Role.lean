# Discourse roles

This file defines the two discourse roles, speaker and addressee, the participants a speech-act
context distinguishes ([kaplan-1989]) and the agents of a two-party commitment model
([gunlogson-2001], [farkas-bruce-2010]). A role's counterpart is the other participant
(`Discourse.Role.other`), an involution without fixed points, so a statement about every role
is a statement about a role and its counterpart (`Discourse.Role.forall_role'`), and the roles
form a nontrivial type.

## Main definitions

* `Discourse.Role` — speaker or addressee.
* `Discourse.Role.other` — the other participant.

## References

* [kaplan-1989]
* [gunlogson-2001]
