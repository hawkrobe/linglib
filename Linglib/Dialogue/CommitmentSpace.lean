# Commitment Space Semantics

[krifka-2015] [cohen-krifka-2014]

Krifka's commitment-space framework: the discourse state is a tree — the
root (√C) is the current CommonGround holding speaker-indexed commitments `S⊢φ`,
and continuations are proposed future states from questions.

- Assertion narrows every state with `commit speaker φ`.
- Monopolar questions add a `commit addressee φ` continuation.
- Bipolar questions add two non-contradictory sibling continuations
  (`commit addressee φ` and `commit addressee ¬φ`).
- High-negation questions (`Didn't I win?`) add a `refuse addressee φ`
  continuation, distinct from low-negation (`Did I not win?`) which adds
  `commit addressee ¬φ`.

Per-agent commitment slates track individual public commitments, enabling
the commitment/belief separation (lying, hedging).

## Speaker indexing

The paper's central primitive is the Frege turnstile `S⊢φ` (p. 332):
assertion is responsibility-undertaking, so what enters the CommonGround is
"speaker S is committed to the truth of φ", not bare φ. The substrate uses
`Discourse.Commitment.IndexedCommitment` to model this — the root
holds indexed commitments, projected to a flat context set via
`IndexedCommitment.toCommitment` for the CommonGround-as-set view.

## Sibling files

`Dialogue/LayeredAssertion.lean` houses Krifka 2020's
TP/JP/ComP/ActP layered-clause framework. The two files are independent
(neither imports the other); study files target whichever fits.

## Substrate scope

The substrate is **two-role discourse with doxastic/preferential force**.
Out of scope (would need substrate extensions):

- **Brandom-style scorecards** (Brandom 1994): commitment indexed by both a
  *keeper* and a *scorer* (per-keeper-per-scorer scoring). The substrate's
  single `committer : DiscourseRole` is keeper-only.
- **Searle's full 5-force taxonomy** (assertive, directive, commissive,
  expressive, declaration): collapsed here to doxastic/preferential per
  the [lauer-2013] duality. Expressives (wishes, exclamatives) and
  declarations (performatives) are not modelled.
- **Time-indexed commitments** (Lauer 2013 PB/PEP carry a `t` index): the
  substrate has no time index; `rejectFirst` is the closest proxy for
  rescission. True time-indexed commitment dynamics need a separate layer.
- **Anderson 2021 distributional CommonGround**: requires `weight_nonneg` on the
  per-world weight. Hosting Anderson via `CommitmentSpace W ℝ` would need
  an `[OrderedAddCommMonoid G]` constraint or an Anderson wrapper —
  current substrate does not enforce non-negativity.

/-- A commitment space ([krifka-2015], eq. (2), p. 329).

    A set of commitment states organized as root + continuations:

    - **root** (√C): the current commitment state — a list of speaker-indexed
      commitments `S⊢φ` (`IndexedCommitment.commit`) or refusals `¬S⊢φ`
      (`IndexedCommitment.refuse`). All worlds compatible with the
      `commit`-projected propositions are "live".
    - **continuations**: proposed future states, each extending the root
      with additional commitments. Added by questions, resolved by acceptance
      (one becomes the new root) or rejection (one is pruned).

    ## Correspondence to Krifka's set-theoretic model

    Krifka's eq. (2) p. 329: `C is a commitment space if C is a set of
    commitment states, ∩C ≠ ∅ and ∩C ∈ C`. The set of states represented
    by this structure is `root :: continuations` — `root` IS √C (= ∩C,
    always present as a state in C), and `continuations` are the
    additional non-root states. Krifka's `{√C} ∪ X` operands in eqs. (23)
    and (27) correspond to keeping `root` as the always-present floor
    while unioning state-sets into `continuations`. The `rejectFirst`
    operation realises Krifka's ℜ retraction (eq. 10, p. 331): pruning a
    proposed continuation leaves √C as the only remaining floor, which is
    exactly the `{√C}` disjunct.

    ## Krifka's key operations

    - Assert `C + S⊢φ` (eq. (1) and (3), p. 329): adds `commit S φ` to root
      and continuations, narrowing every state.
    - Monopolar question `C + ?φ` (eq. (27), p. 336):
      `{√C} ∪ (C + S₂⊢φ)` — preserve root, propose addressee committing to φ.
    - Bipolar question (eq. (23), p. 335):
      `{√C} ∪ (C + S₂⊢φ) ∪ (C + S₂⊢¬φ)` — two non-contradictory siblings.
    - Accept: take a continuation as the new root.
    - Reject: prune a continuation (= return to `{√C}` disjunct).

    The tree structure captures the assertion/question asymmetry:
    assertions modify the root (the CommonGround changes), while questions only
    add continuations (the CommonGround is preserved until acceptance). -/
structure CommitmentSpace (W : Type*) (G : Type*) where
  /-- Root commitment state √C: indexed commitments currently in the CommonGround.
      The grade type `G` lets the same shape host binary (G = Prop),
      distributional (G = ℝ), or credence-bounded (G = ℚ) commitments. -/
  root : List (IndexedWeightedCommitment W G)
  /-- Proposed future states. Questions add these; acceptance promotes
      one to root. Each continuation is a list of indexed commitments
      that extends (narrows) the root. -/

/-- Assert weight `weight` on behalf of `committer`
    ([krifka-2015], eq. (1) and (3), p. 329).

    `C + S⊢φ`: adds `commit committer force weight` to the root and to
    every continuation. Any accepted continuation will also entail the
    weight (with the speaker index recorded). The `force` defaults to
    `.doxastic` (Krifka's standard declarative case); pass `.preferential`
    for the [lauer-2013] imperative-as-PEP case. -/

    `weight` ([krifka-2015], eq. (27), p. 336).

    `C + ?φ = {√C} ∪ (C + S₂⊢φ)`

    The root stays unchanged (CommonGround preserved). A new continuation is added
    where the addressee has committed to `weight`. Existing continuations
    are also extended by the addressee-commitment. The committer is
    hardcoded to `.addressee` per Krifka's discussion of (30), p. 337:
    "the ? head identifies the committer as S₂". -/
def monopolarQuestion (cs : CommitmentSpace W G) (weight : W → G)

/-- High-negation polar question ([krifka-2015], §4 around eq. (39), p. 340).

    `Didn't I win?` = monopolar question with negation at the ComP layer
    (denegation of the addressee's commitment to φ). Proposes that the
    addressee NOT commit to φ — pragmatically weaker than committing to ¬φ.

    Polymorphic in `G`: the `refuse` constructor's content is always
    `W → Prop` (a meta-fact about the agent's slate, not a graded weight),
    so this operator works for any grade type.

    Per [krifka-2015] p. 340: "adding ¬S₂⊢φ to the commitment space
    precludes commitment to φ, but is compatible with commitment to ¬φ.
    Hence ¬S₂⊢φ is pragmatically weaker than S₂⊢¬φ." -/

/-- The space has no open continuations (no unresolved proposals).

    Renamed from `isSettled` — Krifka has no stability/settledness notion
    in the paper; questions just "restrict legal continuations" (p. 335).

/-- Denegate a speech act `~A`. Originally introduced by
    [cohen-krifka-2014] §2 (around eq. (26), p. 51, with full
    development through eqs. 31–38, pp. 52–53); inherited by
    [krifka-2015] eq. (5), p. 330.

    `C + ~A = C — [C + A]`: the result keeps √C and prunes the legal
    continuations that would arise from performing the act `A`. The
    caller supplies a Prop-valued predicate `actMarker` identifying the
    commitment that `A` would add to continuations, plus a
    `DecidablePred` instance for the filter. We keep continuations
    that do NOT contain a matching commitment.

    Concrete example: `denegate cs (fun ic => ic matches ASSERT(speaker, doxastic, φ))`
    is `~ASSERT(φ)` — the GRANT(¬φ) of [cohen-krifka-2014] eq. (38).

    Polymorphic in `G`. The predicate-based formulation avoids the
    soundness issue of trying to decide equality on `W → G` (generally
    undecidable for infinite W). -/

/-! ### Polymorphic operators via `[CommitmentGrade G]`

The following operators are polymorphic in `G` via the
`CommitmentGrade` typeclass (`Discourse/Commitment.lean` §4):
`bipolarQuestion` and `negatedQuestionLow` use `complement` to
construct the "no" branch; `toContextSet` and the force-aware variants
use `support` to project per-world weights to `Prop`.

Instances are provided for `G = Prop` (`complement := Not`,
`support := id`) and `G = Bool` (`complement := !`,
`support := (· = true)`). For other `G` (ℚ, ℝ), provide the instance
at the consumer's site.

/-- Commitment Closure: assertion immediately narrows the commitment space.
    The root after asserting φ on behalf of `committer` is the original root
    with the indexed `commit committer φ` prepended.

    commitment to all nodes including the root. -/

    This connects the two modes of updating: direct assertion (committer

    by committing themselves). The roots match because both produce

/-- The two discourse roles in a speech act.

    Every speech act has an **actor** (who performs the act) and a
    **committer** (who undertakes the commitment). These can diverge:

    - Assertion: actor = speaker, committer = speaker
    - Monopolar question: actor = speaker, committer = addressee
      (the speaker proposes that the addressee commit)

    Per [krifka-2015] p. 337 around eq. (30): the `?` ActP head
    identifies the committer as `S₂`, the addressee; the actor of the
    speech act itself remains `S₁`. -/

    approximation when there are no anaphoric ties. We compose sequentially.

    For `.disj a b`: speech-act disjunction (eq. (7), p. 330) is
    `[C + 𝔄] ∪ [C + 𝔅]` on commitment-space sets; the union of two
    list-shaped continuation structures is non-trivial and may produce
    a non-rooted space (per Krifka's prose on Figure 5, p. 330). Left
    as `sorry` to avoid silently returning a wrong answer. Reverse-tag
    worked examples are blocked on this; the structural theorem
    `reverse_tag_is_disjunction` does not depend on `applyComplex`. -/
