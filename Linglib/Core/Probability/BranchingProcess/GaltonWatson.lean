# Multitype Galton–Watson processes

A multitype Galton–Watson process with types `ι` is an offspring kernel `ξ : Kernel ι (List ι)`:
an individual of type `i` has offspring drawn from `ξ i`, an ordered list of types, each of which
founds an independent copy of the process. The family tree of an individual is the plane tree of
[neveu-1986], a `RoseTree ι`; its law on finite trees is the least fixed point of the
one-generation operator on the Giry monad, and the missing mass is the probability of surviving
forever.

A probabilistic context-free grammar is the instance whose types are the symbols: a terminal has
no offspring, and a nonterminal's offspring is the right-hand side of a rule chosen with its
weight; see `PCFG.galtonWatson`.

## Main definitions

* `GaltonWatson.PartialTree`: family trees with holes, the states of the generation chain.
* `GaltonWatson.fill`: the kernel filling the holes of a partial tree with independent draws
  from a family of laws, and `GaltonWatson.generation`: the kernel expanding every hole by one
  generation.
* `GaltonWatson.expand`: one generation from a single hole followed by filling, and
  `GaltonWatson.law`: its least fixed point, the law of the finite family tree at each type.
* `GaltonWatson.weight`: the probability of a finite family tree, the product over its nodes of
  the offspring probability there.
* `GaltonWatson.extinctionProb`: the total mass of `law`, the probability that the family tree
  is finite.
* `GaltonWatson.chainKernel`, `GaltonWatson.trajectory`: with Markov offspring, the generation
  chain in Ionescu–Tulcea form and, through `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.traj`, the law of its
  whole trajectory.

## Main results

* `GaltonWatson.law_eq_iSup_iterate`: the law is the supremum of the Kleene iterates of
  `expand` from the zero kernel.
* `GaltonWatson.law_singleton`: a finite tree rooted at type `i` has probability `weight` under
  the law at `i`, and trees rooted elsewhere have probability `0`.
* `GaltonWatson.law_univ_le_one`: with sub-probability offspring the law is a sub-probability
  kernel.
* `GaltonWatson.fill_expand`: filling with one more generation is one generation followed by
  filling, so `GaltonWatson.fill_iterate` identifies the Kleene iterates with the completed part
  of the generation chain and `GaltonWatson.law_eq_iSup_generation` expresses the law as their
  supremum.
* `GaltonWatson.trajectory_map_eval`: at time `n` the trajectory is distributed as `n`
  generations, so the Kleene iterates are the marginals of the trajectory measure.

## Implementation notes

Trees and lists carry the discrete σ-algebra `⊤`, so every function out of them is measurable
and, with `ι` countable, every measure on them is s-finite and every kernel between them is an
s-finite kernel; Fubini then needs no finiteness hypotheses. Partial trees are
`RoseTree (ι ⊕ ι)`, a hole of type `i` being a leaf `Sum.inl i` and an expanded individual a node
`Sum.inr i`. The offspring kernel is not required to be Markov: sub-probability offspring model
killing, and the grammar instance produces the zero measure at a nonterminal no rule expands. The
extinction probability is the least fixed point of the offspring generating function and equals
one exactly when the mean matrix is subcritical or critical ([athreya-ney-1972]); that theorem is
not proved here.
