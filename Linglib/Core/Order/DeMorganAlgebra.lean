# De Morgan algebras and Kleene algebras

`LatticeWithInvolution` is a bounded lattice with an involutive antitone complement `ᶜ` —
the common reduct of `OrthocomplementedLattice` (which adds the complementation laws) and
`DeMorganAlgebra` (which adds distributivity instead). The De Morgan laws are proved once
here, from involution and antitonicity alone. An `Order.KleeneAlgebra` is a De Morgan
algebra satisfying the Kleene law `a ⊓ aᶜ ≤ b ⊔ bᶜ`: every `BooleanAlgebra` qualifies
(the law degenerates through `⊥`), and the three-element chain `Trivalent` is the
canonical non-Boolean example. These are the involution branch between mathlib's
`DistribLattice` and `BooleanAlgebra`, beside the existing pseudocomplement branch
(`HeytingAlgebra`).

Naming follows the literature exactly ("De Morgan algebra", "Kleene algebra" — the
lattice notion, not the regular-expression star-semiring that holds mathlib's root
`KleeneAlgebra`), disambiguated by namespace on the `Order.Frame` precedent. De Morgan
algebras are here bounded, as in Balbes-Dwinger (the nLab entry defines the unbounded
variant). `[UPSTREAM]` candidate for `Mathlib/Order/DeMorganAlgebra.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `LatticeWithInvolution` — bounded lattice + involutive antitone `ᶜ`; De Morgan
  (`compl_sup`/`compl_inf`), `compl_bot`/`compl_top`, and the injectivity/order lemmas
  are derived here.
* `DeMorganAlgebra` — a distributive `LatticeWithInvolution`.
* `Order.KleeneAlgebra` — a `DeMorganAlgebra` with the Kleene law
  (`inf_compl_le_sup_compl`); every `BooleanAlgebra` is an instance.
