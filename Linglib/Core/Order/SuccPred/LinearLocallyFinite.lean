# Locally finite linear orders embed in the integers

`[UPSTREAM]` candidate for `Mathlib/Order/SuccPred/LinearLocallyFinite.lean`. A locally finite
linear order embeds in `ℤ` by numbering its elements from a base point, `toZ`, once it is given
the successor and predecessor structure of a locally finite order.
