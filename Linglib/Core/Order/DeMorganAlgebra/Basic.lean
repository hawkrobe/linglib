# De Morgan and Kleene algebras

This file defines Kleene's law for lattices with an involutive complement. A *De Morgan algebra*
is a bounded distributive lattice with an involutive complement, written
`[DistribLattice α] [BoundedOrder α] [InvolutiveCompl α]` and needing no class of its own. A
*Kleene algebra* adds Kleene's law `a ⊓ aᶜ ≤ b ⊔ bᶜ`, that contradictions lie below excluded
middles; Kalman's "normal" lattices with involution are the distributive lattices satisfying it,
with or without bounds. Every Boolean algebra is a Kleene algebra, the law degenerating through
`⊥`, and the three-element chain `Trivalent` is the canonical non-Boolean example.

"Kleene algebra" here is the lattice notion, not the regular-expression star-semiring of
mathlib's root `KleeneAlgebra`. Kalman's construction of Kleene algebras from distributive
lattices is in `Core/Order/DeMorganAlgebra/Kalman.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `IsKleene`: the Kleene law, a Prop mixin over `[Lattice α] [InvolutiveCompl α]`.

## Main results

* `BooleanAlgebra.toIsKleene`: every Boolean algebra is a Kleene algebra.
* `Prod` and `Pi` instances of `IsKleene`.

## References
