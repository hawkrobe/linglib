# Heyting implication of lower sets

[UPSTREAM] Lower sets of a preorder form a completely distributive lattice, hence a Heyting
algebra, in mathlib. This file characterizes membership in the Heyting implication: `a` lies in
`P ⇨ Q` when every element below `a` that lies in `P` lies in `Q`. This is the support clause of
intuitionistic and inquisitive implication, whose propositions are lower sets of information
states.

## Main results

* `LowerSet.mem_himp`: membership in `P ⇨ Q`.
