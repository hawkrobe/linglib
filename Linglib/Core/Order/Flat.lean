# The flat order

`Flat α` is `Option α` with the flat order: `⊥` below everything, distinct
values incomparable. It is the lift of the discrete order on `α` — the order
of partial values under extension — and is mathlib's order on `Part α`
carried on its decidable twin `Option` (`le_iff_ofOption_le`), where it
supports `DecidableEq`, `DecidableLE`, `#eval`, and constructor
pattern-matching. "Flat domain" is the domain-theory name for this poset
([winskel-1993]; the `flat` class of Isabelle/HOLCF).

The flat order is bounded-complete but not a lattice: meets are total
(`SemilatticeInf`), joins partial (`PartialUnify`). It is ω-complete
(`OmegaCompletePartialOrder`), every chain being eventually constant.
Linguistically it is one atomic feature slot, ordered by [shieber-1986]'s and
[carpenter-1992]'s subsumption; `Flat Bool` is the knowledge order of Kleene
three-valued logic. Feature bundles arise via the `Pi` `PartialUnify`
instance, with `Compat` as consistency.

The order skeleton follows the `WithBot` mold (`Mathlib/Order/TypeTags.lean`,
`Mathlib/Order/WithBot.lean`) and is an `[UPSTREAM]` candidate for
`Mathlib/Order/Flat.lean`, coexisting with the namespaced `Module.Flat` and
`ConvexCone.Flat`. The `PartialUnify` instance and `compat_iff` stay here.

## Main declarations

* `Flat` — the order-carrying alias, with coercion `↑ : α → Flat α`, and
  `PartialOrder`, `OrderBot`, `SemilatticeInf`, `OmegaCompletePartialOrder`,
  and `PartialUnify` instances
* `Flat.coe_le_coe`, `Flat.not_coe_le_bot` — the order, characterized
* `Flat.or` — left-biased total merge, with `le_or_left`/`or_le`
* `Flat.ωSup_mem_range` — chains attain their supremum (the domain has height ≤ 2)
* `Flat.ωScottContinuous_of_monotone` — monotone maps out of `Flat` are continuous
* `Flat.liftEquiv` — the free-domain universal property: functions `α → D` are
  exactly strict continuous maps `Flat α →𝒄 D`
* `Flat.compat_iff` — slot compatibility (`Compat`), characterized
* `Flat.unify_distinct_eq_none` — distinct atoms do not unify (the
  non-distributivity witness)

## TODO

The free-domain universal property is now `liftEquiv` (with its enabling lemma
`ωScottContinuous_of_monotone`). The remaining domain-theoretic program:

* **Categorical freeness.** Package `liftEquiv` as a free–forgetful adjunction
  between `Type` and the pointed `ωCPO` category — `Flat ⊣ U` (template:
  mathlib's `latToBddLatForgetAdjunction`, the free bounded lattice via
  `WithBot`).
* **Lifting monad.** Give `Flat` (= `Option`) its ω-CPO monad structure — the
  partiality/lifting monad — whose Kleisli arrows `α → Flat β` are partial
  continuous functions; `PartialUnify.unify` is one, which is why it composes
  through `Option.bind` (`unify_assoc`). (mathlib has this for `Part`.)
* **Algebraicity / bounded-completeness.** Every element of `Flat α` is compact,
  making it an algebraic (finite-height) bounded-complete domain — the
  Scott-domain packaging of the partial join `PartialUnify` provides.
* **Three-valued logic.** `Flat Bool` is the knowledge order of Kleene
  three-valued logic; the strong-Kleene connectives are exactly its continuous
  maps. Connects this substrate to the trivalence/presupposition layer.
* An inductive `Flat.LT` in the `WithBot.LT` mold, for upstreaming.

The flat order is not distributive: three distinct atoms (with a top
adjoined) form the diamond M₃ — [carpenter-1992] takes subsumption orders
to be neither distributive nor modular in general. `Flat` carries only the
partial join (`PartialUnify`), so the distributive law cannot even be
*stated* on it directly; `unify_distinct_eq_none` is the witness — distinct
atoms have no upper bound, so the join the law would require is undefined. -/
