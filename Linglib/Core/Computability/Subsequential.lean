# Subsequential functions and finite-state transducers

A subsequential transducer is a sequential transducer — a deterministic state machine
emitting a block of output for each input symbol, which is a `Mealy` machine over the
output alphabet `List β` — together with a final block determined by the ending state
[schutzenberger-1977] [mohri-1997]. The functions so computed — *subsequential*, with
left- and right-scan variants — form a proper subclass of the rational functions
[filiot-reynier-2016].

We show that each class is closed under composition, that the two are isomorphic under
reverse-conjugation, that both contain the Mealy-computable functions, and that
left-subsequential functions pull back regular languages; a subsequential function
withholds at most a bounded stretch of output (`bounded_delay`).

Like `DFA`, this definition allows for machines with infinite states; the
classification predicates require a `Fintype` instance.

## Main definitions

* `SubsequentialTransducer σ α β`: transducer over alphabets `α`, `β` and states `σ`
* `SubsequentialTransducer.run` / `SubsequentialTransducer.runRight`: the two passes
* `SubsequentialTransducer.comp`: the machine computing the composite function
* `SubsequentialTransducer.ofWindow`: the sliding-window transducer
* `DFA.comapSubsequential`: pulls an acceptor back along a transducer
* `IsLeftSubsequential f`, `IsRightSubsequential f`, `IsSubsequential d f`: some
  finite-state transducer computes `f` in the given scan direction

## Main theorems

* `isLeftSubsequential_iff`, `isRightSubsequential_iff`: the universe-polymorphic
  characterizations
* `IsLeftSubsequential.comp`, `IsRightSubsequential.comp`: closure under composition
* `IsMealyComputable.isLeftSubsequential`: Mealy-computable functions are
  left-subsequential
* `isLeftSubsequential_windowRun`: a window recursion over a finite window alphabet is
  left-subsequential
* `IsLeftSubsequential.isRegular_preimage`, `IsRightSubsequential.isRegular_preimage`:
  subsequential functions pull back regular languages
* `IsLeftSubsequential.bounded_delay`, `IsRightSubsequential.bounded_delay`: all but
  boundedly many symbols of `f u` survive extending the input on the far side

## Implementation notes

The name follows [choffrut-1977] and [mohri-1997]: *sequential* without state-final
output, *subsequential* with. [sakarovitch-2009] calls this class *sequential* (and
the empty-flush case *pure sequential*), flagging his usage as unconventional (cf.
[bruyere-reutenauer-1999]); we keep the Choffrut spelling. `Mealy` is the
letter-to-letter case.

`step` is total, so only the *total* subsequential functions are modelled — a sink
state does not recover partiality — and the initial-output function of
[sakarovitch-2009] is omitted. The state run `stateAfter` and its lemmas are those of
the underlying `Mealy` machine. There are two disjoint sets of simp lemmas, one for
`run` and another for `runFrom`; switch from the former to the latter via `simp [run]`.

## TODO

* Choffrut's theorem [choffrut-1977]: a rational function is subsequential iff it has
  bounded variation, decidably via twinning; `bounded_delay` is far weaker.
* Canonical forms and minimization; two-way transducers; p-subsequential functions.

all but the last `N` symbols of `f u` are a prefix of `f (u ++ v)`. Much weaker than

own extensions. -/
