# Side-determinacy: myopia and unbounded circumambience

Locality predicates on string functions, used to classify phonological maps in the
function-level subregular hierarchy. The kernel `OutputDependsOn f i K` says output
coordinate `i` of `f` is fixed by the input positions in `K`.

The two phonological notions both papers in this line center are instances:

* **Myopia** ([wilson-2006]; the "no look-ahead" generalisation): a side's influence
  on the output is *bounded*.
* **Unbounded circumambience** ([mccollum-bakovic-mai-meinhardt-2020] def. 13): some
  target depends on input *arbitrarily far on both sides at once*.

## Main definitions

* `OutputDependsOn` — output coord `i` determined by input positions in `K`.
* `UnboundedDependence f s` — for every distance `d`, some output flips under a
  perturbation strictly beyond `d` on side `s`.
* `IsMyopicTowards f s` — the negation: dependence on side `s` is bounded.
* `IsUnboundedCircumambient` — co-located form of def. 13: for every `d`, ONE base
  word with a target that flips under both a far-left and a far-right perturbation.

## Implementation notes

The predicates are **distance-based** (`∀ d, ∃ word + target`), not fixed-index. A
fixed target index has only finitely many positions to its left, so a fixed-index
"unbounded left dependence" is unsatisfiable; the unbounded distance must be witnessed
by ever-longer words. The co-located `IsUnboundedCircumambient` keeps both
perturbations on a single shared base (so any computing automaton hits one context
where neither side alone fixes the output) — the hook for the deferred
"circumambient ⟹ non-deterministic" classification.

## Todo

* The machine-level `IsUnboundedCircumambient f → ¬ IsWeaklyDeterministic f` theorem
  (the bridge to `Function/WeaklyDeterministic.lean`; needs bimachine substrate, with
  the co-located base as its automaton-context witness).
