# Strictly local languages (SL_k)

A language `L` is **strictly `k`-local** when membership is determined by the
length-`k` substrings of the boundary-augmented input: a grammar is a set `G` of
permitted `k`-factors, and `w ∈ L` iff every `k`-factor of `boundary k w` lies in
`G`. The forbidden-factor dual (`G = Fᶜ`) is finite even over an infinite alphabet.

## Main definitions

* `Subregular.SLGrammar α`: a grammar is just a set of permitted factors over
  `Augmented α`; the locality width `k` is supplied to `language`, not baked in.
* `Subregular.SLGrammar.language k`: the `Language α` it generates at width `k`.
* `Subregular.SLGrammar.ofForbidden`: the grammar of a forbidden-factor set (its
  complement).
* `Language.IsStrictlyLocal L k`: `L` is strictly `k`-local.
* `Language.SuffixSubstitutionClosed L k`: members sharing a length-`(k − 1)` window
  admit suffix crossover.

## Main results

* `Language.isStrictlyLocal_iff_suffixSubstitutionClosed`: for `k ≥ 2`, strict
  `k`-locality is exactly closure under suffix substitution: the crossover's factors
  split into the two members' shared parts, and conversely the canonical grammar of
  licensed factors regenerates the language by stitching a member window-by-window.

/-! ### Count-vector characterisation

Membership in a forbidden-factor SL language is a zero-test of a single
linear functional of the word's `k`-factor count vector — the total count of
forbidden factors — with unit margin on nonmembers. Strict locality is thus
linearly detectable on the factor-count (cue) representation. -/
