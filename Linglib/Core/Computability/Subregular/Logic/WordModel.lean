# Word models

The model-theoretic representation underlying logical characterizations of subregular
functions: a string viewed as a finite labeled linear order. A **word model** is the
relational signature `⟨D, L, R⟩` — a domain `D` of positions, unary labels `L`, and the
binary immediate-successor relation `R`; general precedence is the (FO-definable) transitive
closure of successor and is not part of the quantifier-free fragment.

The carrier is `List α` itself: a string *is* its word model. This is deliberately where
mathlib stops — it has strings (`List`/`FreeMonoid`) and automata (`DFA`, `MyhillNerode`)
but no model-theoretic word structure — and it keeps the logic layer directly composable
with `Subregular`'s string functions (`Subregular.IsInputStrictlyLocal`, `SFST`).

## Main definitions

* `Subregular.Logic.WordModel` — a string over `α`, viewed as `⟨D, label, succ⟩`.
* `WordModel.label?` — the unary label (symbol) at a position, `none` off the edge.
* `WordModel.Mem` — domain membership of a position.
* `WordModel.succ?` / `WordModel.pred?` — successor/predecessor as partial functions.

## Implementation notes

Positions are `ℕ` indices; a position is in-domain iff below `length`. Successor and
predecessor are *partial functions* (`Option ℕ`) rather than relations — this is what lets
the quantifier-free term language (`Logic/QFLogic.lean`) reach a bounded neighbourhood via
`succ`/`pred` chains without quantifiers, the syntactic source of strict locality.
