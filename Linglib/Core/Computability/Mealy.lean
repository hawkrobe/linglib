# Mealy machines

A Mealy machine [mealy-1955] is a deterministic transducer which reads its input left to
right and emits exactly one output symbol per input symbol, so the function it computes
is length-preserving by construction. Output coordinate `i` of the run is the output
at the state reached after the length-`i` input prefix (`Mealy.getElem?_run`),
so the output is prefix-determined at every coordinate.

Note that this definition allows for machines with infinite states; a `Fintype`
instance must be supplied for the finite-state class `IsMealyComputable`.

## Main definitions

* `Mealy σ α β`: transducer with states `σ`, input alphabet `α`, output alphabet `β`
* `Mealy.run`, `Mealy.runRight`: the left-to-right and right-to-left passes
* `Mealy.comp`: the cascade connection, computing the composite function
* `Mealy.ofFn`: the single-state machine applying a fixed symbol map letter-wise
* `Mealy.ofFlag`: the one-bit machine tracking whether an earlier symbol satisfies `p`
* `Mealy.map`: transport along an equivalence on states
* `IsMealyComputable f`: `f` is computed by some finite-state `Mealy`
* `DFA.comapMealy`: pulls an acceptor back along a transducer

## Main theorems

* `Mealy.getElem?_run`: output coordinate `i` is the output at the state reached
  after the length-`i` input prefix
* `Mealy.getElem?_ofFlag_run`, `Mealy.getElem?_ofFlag_runRight`: each coordinate of a
  flag machine sees the flag over its strict prefix (its strict suffix, for the
  right-to-left pass)
* `isMealyComputable_iff`: the universe-polymorphic characterization
* `IsMealyComputable.comp`: closure under composition
* `IsMealyComputable.isRegular_preimage`: Mealy-computable maps pull back regular
  languages

## Implementation notes

The functions computed by Mealy machines are the *sequential functions* of algebraic
automata theory [holcombe-1982]. `SubsequentialTransducer` generalizes to word-block
outputs and a state-final output [mohri-1997]; `Mealy.toSubsequentialTransducer`
exhibits a Mealy machine as the singleton-output, empty-flush case.

[UPSTREAM] candidate: `Mathlib.Computability.Mealy`.

The Myhill–Nerode characterization of the Mealy-computable functions by their
residuals is in `Core/Computability/MyhillNerode.lean`.

## TODO

* Mealy machine homomorphisms [holcombe-1982], with `map` at an equivalence as the
  isomorphism case.
* The right-scan mirror via reverse conjugation.
* Moore machines (state-determined output) and the Mealy–Moore equivalence: same
  states one way, `σ × β` states the other, so the computable classes coincide.
* The graph view: the zipped graph of a Mealy-computable map is a regular language
  over `α × β` (the synchronous rational relations). Residuals of the map correspond
  to left quotients of the graph, so this would derive `isMealyComputable_iff_residual`
  from the language Myhill–Nerode theorem.
