# The derivation measure of a probabilistic context-free grammar

A PCFG is a multitype Galton–Watson process whose types are the symbols: a terminal has no
offspring, and a nonterminal's offspring is the right-hand side of a rule at it chosen with its
weight. The law of the family tree is the law of the derivation tree, and the product of rule
weights `PCFG.derivProb` is the Galton–Watson weight of the tree, so it is derived from the
generation process rather than stipulated. Total mass one is tightness in the sense of
[booth-thompson-1973] and [chi-1999], consistency in older terminology: the grammar almost surely
produces a finite derivation from every symbol.

## Main definitions

* `PCFG.galtonWatson`: the offspring kernel of a PCFG.
* `PCFG.derivationMeasure`: the law of the derivation tree at each symbol, as a kernel.
* `PCFG.IsTight`: total mass one at every symbol.

## Main results

* `PCFG.galtonWatson_weight`: the Galton–Watson weight of a tree is `derivProb`.
* `PCFG.isMarkovKernel_galtonWatson`: when every nonterminal has a rule, the offspring kernel is
  Markov.
* `PCFG.derivationMeasure_singleton`: a tree rooted at `s` has probability `derivProb` under the
  derivation measure at `s`, and trees rooted elsewhere have probability `0`.
* `PCFG.derivationMeasure_apply_univ_le_one`: the derivation measure is a sub-probability
  kernel; `PCFG.isTight_iff` says it is Markov exactly when the grammar is tight.
