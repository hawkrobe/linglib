# Semiring view of deterministic decoders

When the noise kernel is `dirac` (no noise), aggregating scores across
a finite candidate set is itself an algebraic operation — the additive
operation in a tropical or max-plus semiring. This is the bridge from
the RUM/decoder picture to the parsing-theoretic semiring picture
([goodman-1999]; [eisner-2002]; [mohri-2002]).

| Decoder            | Underlying algebraic structure                    |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `argminDecoder`    | min-plus tropical semiring `Tropical R`           |
| `argmaxDecoder`    | max-plus semiring (= tropical over `OrderDual R`) |
| `softmaxDecoder α` | log-sum-exp ("warped") semiring on `ℝ`            |

In each row, the *additive* identity of the semiring is the "maximizer/minimizer
takes all" choice operation across alternatives, and the *multiplicative*
identity is the per-candidate score-combination operation. The decoder's
job is then to identify which candidates realise the additive identity.

## What this file proves

The bridge to mathlib's `Tropical R` (a min-plus semiring): the tropical
sum of `trop`-tagged scores is `trop` of their `inf`. Specialised to a
Finset of candidates, this says that choosing the additive identity in
the tropical semiring picks out exactly the score that `argminDecoder`
distributes its mass over — making the algebraic and operational views
of lex-min coincide.

The max-plus dual follows by replacing `R` with `OrderDual R`: argmax is then the same algebraic operation in the dual semiring.

## The dequantized bridge

§ 4 connects `lseFinset` (the warped semiring's additive operator at
finite temperature, in `Dequantization/LogSumExp/Basic.lean`) to argmax
via the `α → ∞` limit (`lseFinset_tendsto_sup'` in
`Dequantization/LogSumExp/Limit.lean`):
a candidate is an argmax optimum exactly when its score equals
`lim_{α → ∞} lseFinset α cands score`. This is the semiring-level
statement of the softmax → argmax limit: as the inverse temperature sweeps to its
limit, the soft "log-sum-exp aggregator" deforms to the hard "max
aggregator", and "this candidate's score equals the aggregate" is
exactly the argmax condition.

## Max-plus semiring

The max-plus semiring on `R` is the tropical semiring on `OrderDual R`:
addition is `max` (= `min` in the dual order), multiplication is the
underlying `+`. For real-valued real-valued scores, the relevant
structure is max-plus on `WithBot ℝ` (with `-∞` as the additive identity).

The argmax decoder is the max-plus analogue of `argminDecoder`:
`argmaxDecoder` picks the candidate(s) realising the max-plus sum of
all candidate scores, i.e., the maximum.

Stating this via the existing tropical machinery requires going through
`OrderDual` plus `WithTop` instances; for our purposes the concrete
`argminDecoder ↔ trop_sum` bridge above is the main statement, and the
argmax case is its dual.

/-- A candidate `c ∈ cands` is an argmax winner exactly when its score
    equals the `α → ∞` limit of `lseFinset α cands score`.

    This is the dequantized analogue of `argmin_winner_iff_trop_sum`:
    the operational notion of "winner" (achieves the maximum) coincides
    with the algebraic notion (score realises the additive identity of
    the dequantized warped semiring, i.e., the limit of the soft
    aggregator). The forward direction uses
    `lseFinset_tendsto_sup'` (`Dequantization/LogSumExp/Limit.lean`),
    and the algebraic
    characterisation reduces to `score c = cands.sup' hne score`. -/
