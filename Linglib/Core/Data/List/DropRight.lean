# Lemmas about `List.rtake` and `List.rdrop`

`Mathlib/Data/List/DropRight.lean` defines `List.rtake l n` and `List.rdrop l n`, the last `n`
elements of `l` and `l` without them, and proves only their `nil`, `zero`, `concat`, and reverse
characterizations, plus a few `rdrop`-of-append facts. This file supplies the tail mirrors of the
`List.take` and `List.drop` API in `Init/Data/List/Nat/TakeDrop.lean`, each proved by reducing to
its front counterpart through `List.rtake_eq_reverse_take_reverse` or
`List.rdrop_eq_reverse_drop_reverse`. [UPSTREAM] candidates for `Mathlib/Data/List/DropRight.lean`.

## Main results

* `List.length_rtake`, `List.length_rtake_le`, `List.rtake_of_length_le`, and their `rdrop`
  twins `List.length_rdrop` and `List.rdrop_of_length_le`: lengths and saturation on a short
  list, mirroring `List.length_take`, `List.length_take_le`, `List.take_of_length_le`,
  `List.length_drop`, and `List.drop_of_length_le`.
* `List.getElem?_rtake`, `List.getElem?_rdrop`, `List.getLast?_rtake`: indexing into a tail-take
  or tail-drop, mirroring `List.getElem?_drop`, `List.getElem?_take`, and `List.head?_take`.
* `List.rtake_rtake`, `List.rtake_append`, `List.rdrop_append`: nested tail-takes and the
  tail-take or tail-drop of an append, mirroring `List.take_take`, `List.take_append`, and
  `List.drop_append`. `List.rtake_append_of_le_length`, `List.rtake_append_length`, and
  `List.rtake_append_length_add` are the corollaries mirroring `List.take_append_of_le_length`
  and mathlib's `List.rdrop_append_length` and `List.rdrop_append_length_add`.
* `List.rdrop_append_rtake`: the tail analog of `List.take_append_drop`.
* `List.rtake_append_rtake` and `List.rtake_append_append_of_le_length`: the last `n` elements
  are a sufficient state, so truncating before appending, or prepending anything to a block of
  length at least `n`, leaves the tail-take unchanged.
