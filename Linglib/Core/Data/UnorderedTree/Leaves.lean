# Leaf projections of an unordered tree

`RoseTree.leavesWithDepth` and `RoseTree.leaves` are `Perm`-invariant, so they descend to the
quotient, and the leaf statistics by predicate descend with them.

## Main definitions

* `UnorderedTree.leavesWithDepth`, `UnorderedTree.leaves`: the projections.

## Main results

* `UnorderedTree.card_leaves`: the projection has `numLeaves` elements.
* `UnorderedTree.countP_leaves_lt_numNodes_of_not_root`: when the root fails the predicate,
  the counted leaves are among the non-root vertices.
