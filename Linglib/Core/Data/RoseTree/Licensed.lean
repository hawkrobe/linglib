# Licensed trees

A relation `R a ks` says that a node labelled `a` may have daughters labelled `ks`, in order: it
is a set of local trees, each a node's label with its daughters' labels. `R` licenses a tree when
every subtree of the tree satisfies it at its root, and the trees `R` licenses form a local tree
language. The derivation trees of a context-free grammar are the trees its rules license, and any
well-formedness condition on a node and its daughters' labels takes the same form; a condition on
the root alone is a separate conjunct, and a condition that reads the daughters' subtrees is not
of this form. A tree is licensed exactly when each of its local trees is
(`licensed_iff_forall_mem_localTrees`), which decides licensing.

## Main definitions

* `RoseTree.Licensed R t`: every subtree of `t` satisfies `R` at its root.

## Main results

* `RoseTree.licensed_node_iff`: a tree is licensed when its root's local tree satisfies `R` and
  its children are licensed; `RoseTree.Licensed.induction` is the induction principle.
* `RoseTree.Licensed.of_subtreeAt`: licensing passes to subtrees.
* `RoseTree.Licensed.replaceAt`: replacing a subtree by a licensed tree with the same root value
  keeps the tree licensed.
* `RoseTree.licensed_of_perm`: a relation that ignores the order of the children licenses
  permuted trees alike, so it licenses unordered trees.
