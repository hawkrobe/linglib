# Rose trees under Gorn addresses

A **Gorn address** is a `List ℕ` path of child indices from the root, and `subtreeAt` navigates a
rose tree by one. The addresses inside a tree are its positions (`validPaths`), a prefix-closed set
of `TreePath`s, and the subtrees are the trees reached by descending through children
(`IsSubtree`). Navigation recurses on the address, not on the tree. This file also shows that
relabelling commutes with navigation, that a subtree is no larger than its tree and that a tree of
height above `k` descends `k` steps. It defines `vertices`, which enumerates the addresses, and
`replaceAt`, which replaces the subtree at an address.

Unlike `BinaryTree.get` (indexed by a `PosNum` left/right path) there is no `indexOf`: that is
a binary-search-tree lookup, which has no analogue for a general rose tree.

## Main declarations

* `RoseTree.subtreeAt`, `RoseTree.validPaths`: the subtree at an address, and the addresses
  inside a tree, prefix-closed (`validPaths_prefix_closed`).
* `RoseTree.IsSubtree`: the subtree relation, the subtrees being the values of `subtreeAt`
  (`isSubtree_iff_exists_subtreeAt`). It is a partial order (`IsSubtree.antisymm`).
* `RoseTree.subtrees`: the subtrees in preorder, exactly those of `IsSubtree` (`mem_subtrees`),
  which decides it.
* `RoseTree.subtreeAt_map`: relabelling commutes with navigation.
* `RoseTree.exists_subtreeAt_height_sub`: a maximal descent from a tree of height above `k`.
* `RoseTree.numNodes_le_of_subtreeAt`: a subtree is no larger than its tree.
* `RoseTree.vertices`: the addresses in preorder, one per vertex (`length_vertices`,
  `nodup_vertices`) and exactly those inside the tree (`mem_vertices`).
* `RoseTree.positionedLeaves`: the leaves with their addresses, exactly the leaf addresses
  (`subtreeAt_of_mem_positionedLeaves`, `mem_positionedLeaves_of_subtreeAt`) in the order of the
  frontier (`map_snd_positionedLeaves`), which is precedence (`pairwise_precedes_positionedLeaves`).
* `RoseTree.replaceAt`: replacement at an address, leaving the subtrees away from it unchanged
  (`subtreeAt_replaceAt_of_not_prefix`) and those above it holding the replacement
  (`subtreeAt_replaceAt_of_prefix`), splitting the frontier (`leafList_replaceAt`) and shrinking
  the tree when the new subtree is smaller (`numNodes_replaceAt_lt`).
