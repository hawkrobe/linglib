# Leaf projections of a rose tree

`leavesWithDepth` collects the leaves of a rose tree as a multiset of
`(label, root-distance)` pairs; `leaves` forgets the depths. Leaf statistics are then
`Multiset` computations: a count of the leaves satisfying a predicate is `Multiset.countP`
on `leaves`, their depth-weighted count is the sum of `Prod.snd` over the filtered
`leavesWithDepth`, and bounds are inherited from `Multiset.countP_le_card`.

## Main definitions

* `RoseTree.leavesWithDepth`, `RoseTree.leaves`: the projections.

## Main results

* `RoseTree.card_leavesWithDepth`: the projection has `numLeaves` elements.
* `RoseTree.numLeaves_le_numNodes`: a leaf is a vertex.
* `RoseTree.countP_leaves_lt_numNodes_of_not`: when the root fails the predicate, the
  counted leaves are among the non-root vertices.
* `RoseTree.leavesWithDepth_perm`, `RoseTree.leaves_perm`: both projections are
  `Perm`-invariant.
