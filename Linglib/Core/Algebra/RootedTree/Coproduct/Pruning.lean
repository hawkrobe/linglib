# Δ^ρ (admissible-cut, root-component pruning) coproduct on `RoseTree α`
[marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025] [foissy-introduction-hopf-algebras-trees]

The **admissible-cut, root-component pruning** variant of the
Connes-Kreimer coproduct on ordered (planar) n-ary rooted trees `RoseTree α`.
For a tree T:

  Δ^ρ(T) = T ⊗ 1 + Σ_{(F, R) ∈ cutSummandsP T} of' F ⊗ ofTree R

where the empty cut's summand is `1 ⊗ T` (its forest is empty).

**Naming.** Linglib's "Δ^ρ" corresponds to MCB Definition 1.2.6's
**Δ^ρ** (book p. 31) — the admissible-cut coproduct whose right channel
is the root component `ρ_C(T)` after pruning the cut subtrees from the
parent's children list. The result lives in *at-most-n-ary* trees
(Lemma 1.2.11, book p. 38). Per MCB Remark 1.2.9 (book p. 34), this Δ^ρ
coproduct corresponds to the **Foissy Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of
(not-necessarily-binary) rooted trees**, where the right channel can
contain rooted trees that are not binary.

NOT MCB's **Δ^d** (Definition 1.2.5, p. 31), which is "deletion +
rebinarization" — Δ^d additionally contracts edges to recover binarity.
Δ^d is the closest to PF Externalization and would be derived from this
Δ^ρ (or built independently) when a consumer needs it. See sibling
`Coproduct/Deletion.lean` (FUTURE) for that.

For the trace variant **Δ^c** (T/^c F_v, parent arity preserved via
trace leaves; MCB Definition 1.2.4, book p. 30), see sibling
`Coproduct/Trace.lean`. MCB Δ^c on binary nonplanar = restriction of
the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs (a different, related
Hopf algebra; Remark 1.2.9, p. 34). Used at the C-I (semantic)
interface for FormCopy.

## Relation to the generic cut enumeration

The bespoke `cutSummandsP`/`cutListSummandsP`/`augActionP` block below is
the deletion (Δ^ρ) sibling of the extraction-policy-parameterized
`cutSummandsG` in `Coproduct/Defs.lean`. It is NOT re-expressed as
`cutSummandsG (fun _ => some [])` because the downstream coassoc proof
(`Coproduct/PruningNonplanar.lean`) is written against the `Option`
remainder encoding used here — deletion is `Option.none`, a surviving
child is `Option.some r` — whereas `cutSummandsG` carries `List`
remainders (deletion `[]`, survival `[r]`). Folding onto `cutSummandsG`
would change the public return type of `augActionP` (Option → List) and
the shapes of `augActionP_eq`/`cutListSummandsP_cons`, all of which
`PruningNonplanar.lean` consumes; so the two enumerations coexist.
(Δ^c in `Trace.lean` *does* derive from `cutSummandsG`, since it was
written against the `List` encoding.)

## Foissy clean coassoc

Δ^ρ satisfies the Hochschild 1-cocycle condition with B+ (graft as
new root):

  Δ^ρ ∘ B+_a = B+_a ⊗ 1 + (id ⊗ B+_a) ∘ Δ^ρ

The B+ operator only well-defines on `Multiset (Nonplanar α) → Nonplanar α`
(unordered children of a new root). On `RoseTree α` with `Multiset`
forests, B+ would need a canonical ordering. Hence the sorry-free
coassoc proof for Δ^ρ lives in `Coproduct/PruningNonplanar.lean` on
`RootedTree.Nonplanar α`. (Note: this Foissy clean coassoc strategy
does NOT generalize to Δ^c — B+ is not a Hochschild 1-cocycle for the
trace variant. Δ^c coassoc uses Grossman-Larson duality instead; see
the GL substrate when it lands.)

## Status

`[UPSTREAM]` candidate. cutSummands recursive definition; full
Bialgebra structure (descent + coassoc + counit + Hopf antipode) lives
in `Coproduct/PruningNonplanar.lean` and `HopfAlgebraNonplanar.lean`.

/-! ### cutSummandsP — multiset of (cut forest, deletion remainder) pairs

Recursive enumeration of cut summands. For a leaf, the only cut is the
empty cut. For a node, sum over all per-child decisions: each child can
either be extracted whole (contributes to cut forest, drops from
remainder) OR recurse with a smaller cut (contributes whatever its cut
extracts, leaves its deletion-remainder in the remainder list). -/
