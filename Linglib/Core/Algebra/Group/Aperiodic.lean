# Aperiodic monoids

A monoid is **aperiodic** (group-free) when some power stabilises every element:
`∃ n, ∀ x, x ^ (n + 1) = x ^ n`. [schutzenberger-1965] introduced these as the monoids
with only trivial subgroups (his condition `γ fⁿ = γ fⁿ⁺¹`); they are the algebraic side
of the star-free / counter-free / `FO[<]`-definable languages ([pin-mfa],
[mcnaughton-papert-1971]).

`[UPSTREAM]`: mathlib has `Monoid.IsTorsion` but no aperiodicity notion; this is a
candidate for `Mathlib/Algebra/Group/`.

## Main results

* `Monoid.IsAperiodic.of_subsingleton` — subsingleton monoids are aperiodic.
* `Monoid.pow_succ_stabilizes` — once a stabilising power is reached, all higher
  powers stabilise too.
* `Monoid.IsAperiodic.of_surjective` — aperiodicity passes along surjective homs.
* `Monoid.IsAperiodic.of_injective` — aperiodicity is inherited by submonoids.
* `Monoid.IsAperiodic.prod` — a product of aperiodic monoids is aperiodic.
* `Monoid.IsAperiodic.of_mulEquiv` — aperiodicity transports across isomorphisms.
