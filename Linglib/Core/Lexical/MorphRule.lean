# Morphological Infrastructure
@cite{bybee-1985} @cite{champollion-2017} @cite{link-1983} @cite{zwicky-pullum-1983}

Framework-agnostic types for morphological analysis and compositional
morphological rules.

## Typological Classification

- `AttachmentSide`: prefix, suffix, infix, circumfix
- `SelectionDegree`: how restrictive a morpheme's host selection is
- `MorphStatus`: free word / simple clitic / special clitic / affix
- `ParadigmCell`: one cell in a morphological paradigm (form + features)

## @cite{bybee-1985} Relevance Hierarchy

`MorphCategory` classifies morpheme functional categories ordered by
semantic relevance to the stem:

  stem < derivation < valence < voice < aspect < tense < mood < negation < agreement

## Compositional Rules

- `MorphRule σ`: a morphological rule carrying formal AND semantic effects
- `Stem σ`: a lexical stem with its inflectional paradigm

A `MorphRule σ` transforms a stem's surface form, morphosyntactic features,
and meaning of type `σ` simultaneously. Rules where the semantic effect is
`id` (e.g., verb agreement) are marked `isVacuous := true`.

-- §1: Attachment Side
-- ============================================================================

/-- Side on which a bound morpheme attaches to its host. -/
inductive AttachmentSide where
  | prefix     -- attaches before stem (English *un-*, *re-*)
  | suffix     -- attaches after stem (English *-ed*, *-s*, *-n't*)
  | infix      -- inserts within stem (Tagalog *-um-*)
  | circumfix  -- wraps around stem (German *ge-...-t*)
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- Typological position classification for formatives.
    @cite{bickel-nichols-2001} Table 2.

    Superset of `AttachmentSide`: adds simulfixation (process morphology),
    detached formatives (Wackernagel clitics, free auxiliaries), and
    endoclisis (clitic insertion inside a word). -/
inductive FormativePosition where
  | praefixed     -- formative precedes host (= `AttachmentSide.prefix`)
  | postfixed     -- formative follows host (= `AttachmentSide.suffix`)
  | infixed       -- formative inserted within host (= `AttachmentSide.infix`)
  | circumfixed   -- formative wraps host (= `AttachmentSide.circumfix`)
  | simultaneous  -- non-segmental: ablaut, umlaut, tonal change, reduplication
  | detached      -- syntactically free formative (auxiliary, Wackernagel clitic)
  | endoclitic    -- clitic inserted inside a word (Udi, European Portuguese)

-- §2: Selection Degree
-- ============================================================================

/-- How restrictive a morpheme is about what it can attach to.

@cite{zwicky-pullum-1983} criterion A: clitics exhibit low selection
(attach to virtually any word), while affixes exhibit high selection
(attach only to specific stems or categories). -/
inductive SelectionDegree where
  /-- Attaches to words of virtually any category (prepositions, verbs,
      adjectives, adverbs). Characteristic of simple clitics. -/
  | low
  /-- Attaches to words of a single major category (e.g., past tense
      *-ed* to verbs, plural *-s* to nouns). Characteristic of
      inflectional affixes. -/
  | singleCategory
  /-- Attaches only to a closed list of stems (e.g., *-n't* only to
      finite auxiliaries). Maximally selective. -/

-- ============================================================================
-- §3: Morpheme Status
-- ============================================================================

/-- Morphological status of a linguistic form.

Classifies forms by their degree of syntactic independence and
mode of combination. The clitic–affix boundary is the central
question of @cite{zwicky-pullum-1983}: the criteria A–F serve to
locate a given morpheme on this scale. -/
inductive MorphStatus where
  /-- Syntactically independent word. -/
  | freeWord
  /-- Simple clitic: phonologically bound form that can attach to
      hosts of virtually any syntactic category.
      @cite{bickel-nichols-2001}: defined primarily by low selectivity
      (categorical freedom) + phonological dependence, not necessarily
      by being a reduced variant of a free word. Many simple clitics
      have no free-word counterpart (Latin *-que*). English contracted
      auxiliaries (*'s*, *'ve*, *'d*) are a subcase where a free variant
      exists. -/
  | simpleClitic
  /-- Special clitic: either no corresponding free word
      exists, or the distribution differs from the free word.
      Romance pronominal clitics, Latin *-que*. -/
  | specialClitic
  /-- Inflectional affix: paradigmatic, category-preserving, highly
      selective, with possible gaps and idiosyncrasies.
      English *-ed*, *-s*, *-est*, *-n't*. -/
  | inflAffix
  /-- Derivational affix: potentially category-changing, often
      productive but may show lexical restrictions.
      English *-ness*, *un-*, *-ize*. -/
  | derivAffix
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- Is this form bound (i.e., not a free word)? -/

-- ============================================================================
-- §4: Paradigm Cells
-- ============================================================================

/-- A single cell in a morphological paradigm: one form of a lexeme
in a particular morphosyntactic context.

The type parameter `F` is the feature bundle type (e.g., `UD.MorphFeatures`
for a full UD specification, or a simpler domain-specific type). -/

  /-- The morphosyntactic features selecting this cell. -/
  features : F
  /-- The surface form, or `none` for a paradigm gap. -/
  form : Option String
  /-- Is this form predictable from the stem by regular rule? -/
  regular : Bool := true
  deriving Repr, BEq

/-- Does this cell represent a paradigm gap? -/

  !c.regular && c.form.isSome

-- ============================================================================
-- §5: @cite{bybee-1985} Relevance Hierarchy
-- ============================================================================

/-- Morpheme functional category.

Categories are ordered by semantic relevance to the verb stem:
more relevant categories appear closer to the stem in suffixal
morphology. -/
inductive MorphCategory where
  | stem
  | derivation    -- derives verbs from other categories (e.g., *suru*)
  | valence       -- causative, applicative, reciprocal
  | voice         -- passive, potential
  | aspect        -- perfective, imperfective
  | tense         -- past, future, present
  | mood          -- desiderative, subjunctive, imperative
  | negation      -- negation markers
  | agreement     -- subject/object agreement, politeness
  | nonfinite     -- nonfinite markers, interrogative/relative
  | number        -- number marking on nouns (not verb agreement)
  | degree        -- comparative/superlative on adjectives
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq

/-- Relevance rank: lower = closer to the stem.

Stem = 0 (most relevant to verb meaning).
Derivation = 1 (changes verb category).
...
Agreement = 8 (least relevant to verb meaning).

`number` on nouns is ranked 3 (same as voice): Bybee's
relevance hierarchy predicts number is stem-adjacent in noun
morphology (stem < number < case), consistent with cross-linguistic
suffixing order. The semantic motivation via @cite{link-1983}
algebraic closure is a linglib extension, not Bybee's argument.

`degree` on adjectives is ranked 5 (same as tense on verbs).
Note: Bybee's hierarchy is stated for verbs; the extension to
adjectival degree is a linglib analogy (comparative/superlative
morphology modifies the adjective's interpretation analogously
to how tense modifies temporal reference), not a claim from
@cite{bybee-1985}. -/

-- §6: Morphological Rules with Semantic Effects
-- ============================================================================

/-- A morphological rule: carries formal AND semantic effects.

    The type parameter `σ` is the meaning type, so this works uniformly
    across `Bool`/`Frac`/`Float` semantic backends.

    Design principle: `semEffect` can be `id` for semantically vacuous
    morphology (e.g., verb agreement `-s`), making it explicit which
    inflections carry semantic content and which don't. -/

/-- Distribution of inflectional categories between two elements of a
    periphrastic construction (e.g., auxiliary and lexical verb in an AVC).
    @cite{anderson-2006} @cite{bybee-1985}

    In an aux-headed AVC, `onLex` is minimal (stem only or empty).
    In a lex-headed AVC, `onAux` is empty.
    In a split AVC, `onAux` and `onLex` host different category types.
    In a doubled AVC, `onAux` and `onLex` overlap. -/
