# Interlaced bilattices (abstract)
[avron-1996]

An *interlaced bilattice* ([avron-1996] Def 2.1) is one carrier with two bounded
lattice orders — a **truth** order `≤_t` and a **knowledge** order `≤_k` — such
that all four lattice operations are monotone with respect to *both* orders.

To carry two lattice structures on one carrier without an instance clash, we use
the `OrderDual`-style trick: the truth lattice is the carrier's own
`[Lattice B] [BoundedOrder B]`, while the knowledge lattice lives on a type
synonym `Know B` (a distinct type head, so `[Lattice (Know B)]` is a separate
instance). The truth meet/join are `⊓`/`⊔`; the knowledge meet/join (consensus
`⊗`, gullibility `⊕`) are written through the synonym.

This file sets up the synonym, the interlacing mixin, and proves the **general
representation theorem** ([avron-1996] Thm 4.3): every interlaced bilattice is the
twist product of the knowledge-order principal ideals of its truth bounds. Unlike
`Core.Logic.Bilattice.Representation` (which handles the distributive special case
via whole-lattice distributivity), this holds for *any* interlaced bilattice — the
key identities (Cor 3.5, Cor 3.8) are derived from interlacing alone, by
truth-antisymmetry and a fiber lemma rather than Avron's interval argument.

## Main definitions / results

* `Bilattice.Know` — the knowledge-order synonym; `toKnow`/`ofKnow` the casts
* `Bilattice.kInf`/`kSup` — knowledge meet `⊗` / join `⊕` (scoped `⊗`/`⊕`)
* `Bilattice.kLE` — knowledge order `≤_k` (scoped `≤ₖ`)
* `Bilattice.Interlaced` — the four interlacing laws (mixin, [avron-1996] Def 2.1)
* `Bilattice.inf_kT_sup_inf_kF` — Cor 3.8: `X = (X ⊗ t) ⊕ (X ⊗ f)`
* `Bilattice.isCompl_truthBounds` — Cor 3.5: `t`, `f` are knowledge-complementary
* `Bilattice.decompose` — Thm 4.3: `Know B ≃o Iic t × Iic f`

The converse of the twist product: every interlaced bilattice is isomorphic to
the twist product `(Iic t) ⊙ (Iic f)` of the knowledge-order principal ideals of
its truth bounds `t = ⊤`, `f = ⊥`. Proved here at the knowledge lattice via the
decomposition `X ↦ (X ⊓ t, X ⊓ f)`, inverse `(a, b) ↦ a ⊔ b` ([avron-1996] Thm
4.3). The two helper lemmas are [avron-1996]'s Cor 3.5 and Cor 3.8, derived from
interlacing (Prop 3.2 → 3.6 → 3.7 → 3.8). -/
