# Partition as Inquiry — Setoid → Issue embedding
@cite{ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018} @cite{theiler-etal-2018}
@cite{puncochar-2019}

The faithful embedding of partition-based inquiry (`Setoid W` — what
`POSWQ.inquiry` carries) into the more general inquisitive-content
representation (`Issue W` — downward-closed nonempty
families of information states).

## Architectural placement

This file implements the embedding direction prescribed in the
"Architectural note: Setoid vs. Issue" section of
`POSWQ.lean` (added 0.229.922): we keep `inquiry : Setoid W` as the
field of `POSWQ` (partitions are the right shape for the propositional-
discourse use cases that currently exist), and provide a *one-way*
embedding `Setoid → Issue`. The embedding goes this way
and not the other because every Setoid-based partition can be expressed
as an Issue (each equivalence class becomes a maximal
proposition / alternative), but the reverse fails — mention-some,
intermediate-exhaustive, and conditional question alternatives are
non-disjoint or non-exhaustive and so are not representable as the
classes of any equivalence relation (see @cite{theiler-etal-2018}).

This mirrors mathlib's `Set.toFinset` / `Filter.principal` /
`UniformSpace.toTopologicalSpace` pattern: the "less general" structure
sits inside the "more general" one via a faithful but not surjective
forgetful map.

## What this gives us

- `fromSetoid r : Issue W` — the inquisitive content whose
  alternatives are the equivalence classes of `r`. Concretely,
  `props = {q | q = ∅ ∨ ∃ c ∈ r.classes, q ⊆ c}`: a non-empty information
  state `q` resolves the issue iff it is contained in some equivalence
  class (i.e., everything in `q` is `r`-equivalent).
- `info_fromSetoid` — informative content is `Set.univ`. Setoid-based
  inquiry is **non-informative**: it raises an issue but supplies no
  information. (This matches the standard partition-semantics view.)
- `isInquisitive_fromSetoid_of_two_classes` — if `r` has at least two
  distinct equivalence classes, the resulting content is inquisitive
  (in `Issue`'s sense: `info ∉ props`). The trivial
  partition (one class) yields a declarative.

namespace Issue

universe u
variable {W : Type u}

/-- The Issue associated with a setoid `r` on `W`: a
    proposition `q` resolves the issue iff `q = ∅` or `q` is contained
    in some `r`-equivalence class (i.e., everything in `q` agrees on the
    `r`-question). The maximal such propositions are the equivalence
    classes themselves. -/

/-- The informative content of a partition-based inquiry is the whole
    universe: every world is in some equivalence class, so every world
    appears in some resolving proposition. Setoid-derived inquisitive
    contents are **non-informative** — they raise issues but provide no
    information. -/
theorem info_fromSetoid (r : Setoid W) : (fromSetoid r).info = Set.univ := by

/-- If a setoid has two distinct equivalence classes, the resulting

    any single equivalence class (it would have to coincide with both),
    so `info ∉ props`. -/

/-! ### Setoid–Issue bridge: refinement = entailment

The `fromSetoid` embedding is **monotone** in mathlib's lattice order on
`Setoid` (where `r₁ ≤ r₂` iff `r₁` is *finer*: `r₁.Rel x y → r₂.Rel x y`)
and the entailment order on `Issue` (`P ≤ Q` iff `P.props ⊆ Q.props`).
The bridge is moreover a **lattice embedding**: `≤` is reflected back.

This is the Set-based form of Groenendijk–Stokhof's "partition refinement
= question entailment", formulated as a one-liner over `Setoid` and
`Core.Issue` with no `worlds : List W` quantifier and no `isPartition`
precondition. -/

/-- The `Setoid → Issue` embedding **reflects** the order: a setoid is
    finer than another iff its inquisitive content is entailed by the
    other's. The forward direction is monotonicity; the backward
    direction uses the fact that `r`-equivalent pairs are resolved by
    the two-element state `{x, y}`, which any cell-membership theorem
    can recover. -/

/-! ### Equivalence classes are alternatives -/

/-- Conversely, every alternative of `fromSetoid r` is either the empty
    state or an equivalence class of `r`. The empty case can only occur
    when `W` is empty (otherwise some class is in `props` and strictly
    contains `∅`, displacing it from maximality). -/
theorem alt_fromSetoid_subset_classes (r : Setoid W) {p : Set W}
    (hp : p ∈ alt (fromSetoid r)) : p = ∅ ∨ p ∈ r.classes := by
  obtain ⟨hp_props, hmax⟩ := hp
  rcases hp_props with hempty | ⟨c, hc, hpc⟩
  · exact Or.inl hempty
  · -- p ⊆ c, but c is itself in props (Or.inr ⟨c, hc, subset_rfl⟩),
    -- so by maximality p = c, hence p is the class c.

      Or.inr ⟨c, hc, subset_rfl⟩
    have heq : p = c := hmax c hc_props hpc
    exact Or.inr (heq ▸ hc)

/-- Each equivalence class of `r` is a maximal element (alternative) of
    `fromSetoid r`. The proof uses (i) classes are nonempty (so they
    aren't displaced by `∅`), and (ii) classes are pairwise disjoint or
    equal — so a class can only be properly contained in itself. -/

    rw [hempty] at hcq
    exact (hcq hv).elim
  · -- q ⊆ c'; since {x | r x v} ⊆ q ⊆ c', the two classes coincide

/-! ## POSWQ bridge

Lift the partition-based inquiry component of a `POSWQ` to its full
`Issue`. This makes every existing POSWQ-using study
automatically a consumer of the inquisitive-content API: `info`,
`alt`, `isInquisitive`, the lattice operations, and the
mention-some/IE-question forcing arguments all become available
without rewriting the underlying state. -/
