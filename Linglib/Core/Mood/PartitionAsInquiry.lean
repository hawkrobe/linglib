# Partition as Inquiry — Setoid → InquisitiveContent embedding
@cite{ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018} @cite{theiler-etal-2018}
@cite{puncochar-2019}

The faithful embedding of partition-based inquiry (`Setoid W` — what
`POSWQ.inquiry` carries) into the more general inquisitive-content
representation (`InquisitiveContent W` — downward-closed nonempty
families of information states).

## Architectural placement

This file implements the embedding direction prescribed in the
"Architectural note: Setoid vs. InquisitiveContent" section of
`POSWQ.lean` (added 0.229.922): we keep `inquiry : Setoid W` as the
field of `POSWQ` (partitions are the right shape for the propositional-
discourse use cases that currently exist), and provide a *one-way*
embedding `Setoid → InquisitiveContent`. The embedding goes this way
and not the other because every Setoid-based partition can be expressed
as an InquisitiveContent (each equivalence class becomes a maximal
proposition / alternative), but the reverse fails — mention-some,
intermediate-exhaustive, and conditional question alternatives are
non-disjoint or non-exhaustive and so are not representable as the
classes of any equivalence relation (see @cite{theiler-etal-2018}).

This mirrors mathlib's `Set.toFinset` / `Filter.principal` /
`UniformSpace.toTopologicalSpace` pattern: the "less general" structure
sits inside the "more general" one via a faithful but not surjective
forgetful map.

## What this gives us

- `fromSetoid r : InquisitiveContent W` — the inquisitive content whose
  alternatives are the equivalence classes of `r`. Concretely,
  `props = {q | q = ∅ ∨ ∃ c ∈ r.classes, q ⊆ c}`: a non-empty information
  state `q` resolves the issue iff it is contained in some equivalence
  class (i.e., everything in `q` is `r`-equivalent).
- `info_fromSetoid` — informative content is `Set.univ`. Setoid-based
  inquiry is **non-informative**: it raises an issue but supplies no
  information. (This matches the standard partition-semantics view.)
- `isInquisitive_fromSetoid_of_two_classes` — if `r` has at least two
  distinct equivalence classes, the resulting content is inquisitive
  (in `InquisitiveContent`'s sense: `info ∉ props`). The trivial
  partition (one class) yields a declarative.

/-- The InquisitiveContent associated with a setoid `r` on `W`: a
    proposition `q` resolves the issue iff `q = ∅` or `q` is contained
    in some `r`-equivalence class (i.e., everything in `q` agrees on the
    `r`-question). The maximal such propositions are the equivalence
    classes themselves. -/

/-- The informative content of a partition-based inquiry is the whole
    universe: every world is in some equivalence class, so every world
    appears in some resolving proposition. Setoid-derived inquisitive
    contents are **non-informative** — they raise issues but provide no
    information. -/

/-- If a setoid has two distinct equivalence classes, the resulting
    inquisitive content is inquisitive: `Set.univ` is not contained in
    any single equivalence class (it would have to coincide with both),
    so `info ∉ props`. -/
