# Monotonicity and ω-continuity of the Giry monad

`Measure.bind` is monotone in both arguments and commutes with suprema of monotone sequences in
both arguments. Together with the complete lattice structure on `Measure α`, this makes an
operator built from `bind` ω-Scott-continuous, so its least fixed point is the supremum of its
Kleene iterates (`fixedPoints.lfp_eq_sSup_iterate`). This is the least-fixed-point semantics of
recursive probabilistic programs of [kozen-1981], stated on the monad of [giry-1982].
`[UPSTREAM]` candidate for `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Measure/GiryMonad.lean`.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.bind_mono`: `bind` is monotone in the measure and in the kernel.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.iSup_apply_of_monotone`: the supremum of a monotone sequence of measures
  is computed pointwise on measurable sets.
* `MeasureTheory.lintegral_iSup_measure_of_monotone`: Lebesgue integrals commute with monotone
  suprema of measures.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.iSup_bind_of_monotone`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.bind_iSup_of_monotone`:
  `bind` commutes with monotone suprema in each argument.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.bind_map`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_bind`,
  `MeasureTheory.Measure.bind_comm`: `bind` and `map` interchange, and two independent `bind`s
  commute (Fubini).
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.ωScottContinuous_bind`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.ωScottContinuous_map`,
  `MeasureTheory.Measure.ωScottContinuous_prod`: `bind` is ω-Scott-continuous jointly in the
  measure and the kernel, `map` in the measure and `prod` in both factors, so operators built
  from them have Kleene least fixed points.

## Implementation notes

`Measure α` is an ω-complete partial order through its complete lattice, while a Pi type of
measures also carries the product ω-CPO instance; the two agree but not reducibly, so continuity
proofs are pinned to explicit suprema through `CompleteLattice.ωSup_eq_iSup` and
`Pi.ωSup_eq_iSup` rather than to `ωSup`.
