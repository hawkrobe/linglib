# Dirac measures and their finite sums

A Dirac measure is a zero-one measure, and a probability measure almost surely equal to a point
is the Dirac measure at it. On a finite type with measurable singletons, `∑ b, w b • dirac b`
gives a set the total weight of its points; `Measure.ofWeights w` names it. With nonnegative real
weights its real values are sums of those weights, and it is a probability measure when they sum
to one. `[UPSTREAM]` candidate for `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Measure/Dirac.lean`.
