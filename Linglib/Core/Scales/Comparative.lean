# Core/Scales/Comparative.lean — ComparativeScale + AdditiveScale
@cite{krantz-1971} @cite{holliday-icard-2013}

Root algebraic structures for the category of scales.

`ComparativeScale α` — a preorder with boundedness classification.
All scale-based reasoning factors through this structure.

`AdditiveScale α` — comparative scale enriched with join and finite
additivity (FA). Two independent linglib instances:
- Mereological: `ExtMeasure.additive`
- Epistemic: `EpistemicSystemFA` + `FinAddMeasure` (@cite{holliday-icard-2013})

This file is part of the Phase A decomposition of the legacy
`Core/Scales/Scale.lean` dumping ground (master plan v4).

/-- A comparative scale: a boundedness classification on a preorder.
    This is the root object in the category of scales. All scale-based
    reasoning in linglib (degree semantics, mereological measurement,
    epistemic comparison) factors through this structure.

    The ordering comes from the ambient `[Preorder α]` — no redundant
    `le`/`le_refl`/`le_trans` fields. Morphisms are Mathlib's `Monotone`.

    @cite{krantz-1971}: a comparative scale is an ordered set with
    enough structure to support qualitative comparison. -/
@[ont_sort] structure ComparativeScale (α : Type*) [Preorder α] where
  /-- Scale boundedness classification -/
  boundedness : Boundedness

/-- An additive scale: a comparative scale enriched with join and finite
    additivity (FA). Two independent instances exist in linglib:
    - Mereological: `ExtMeasure.additive`
    - Epistemic: probability FA

    The FA axiom says disjoint augmentation preserves order: if z is
    disjoint from both x and y, then x ≤ y ↔ x ⊔ z ≤ y ⊔ z. This
    is the qualitative content of additive representation. -/
structure AdditiveScale (α : Type*) [SemilatticeSup α] extends ComparativeScale α where
  /-- Disjointness predicate -/
  disjoint : α → α → Prop
  /-- Finite additivity: disjoint augmentation preserves order.
      Both `≤` and `⊔` come from the ambient `SemilatticeSup`. -/
  fa : ∀ (x y z : α), disjoint x z → disjoint y z →
    (x ≤ y ↔ x ⊔ z ≤ y ⊔ z)
