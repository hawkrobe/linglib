# Admissible Cuts on Trees @cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025}

Per @cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025} Definition 1.2.6, an
**admissible cut** of a binary rooted tree T is a removal of a
collection of edges of T such that no two lie on the same root-to-leaf
path. Equivalently (Lemma 1.2.7), the data of an admissible cut on T
is the same as a forest F_v = T_{v₁} ⊔ ⋯ ⊔ T_{vₙ} of disjoint
accessible terms of T.

## Trees with scalar trace labels

This file defines `CutShape` on `TraceTree α β` (not on `DecoratedTree α`).
The `TraceTree` carrier has scalar trace labels (`.trace (b : β)`)
rather than recursive subtree data. This is the carrier the bialgebra
of @cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025} Lemma 1.2.10 actually inhabits;
see `Decorated.lean` for the rationale: per @cite{marcolli-skigin-2025}
§10.1 (clarifying the brief discussion in M-C-B §1.3), trace labels
are elements of a disjoint marked copy `̄SO₀` of the leaf alphabet,
NOT recursive subtrees, for the bialgebra structure to be well-formed.

For the bialgebra layer, `β = Unit` (no informative trace label) — the
minimal instance, sufficient for coassoc but a strict simplification
of M-S. For the linguistic layer (CI interpretation, FormCopy), a
richer `β` plus a head-function-transparent extractor realizes
@cite{marcolli-skigin-2025} Definition 10.3 (head function projects
each contracted subtree to its head leaf's struck-through label).

This file is **[UPSTREAM]** — generic over `α : Type*` and `β : Type*`.

## Crucial M-C-B reading: leaves ARE accessible terms

Per @cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025} Definition 1.2.2, accessible
terms are subtrees `T_v` for `v ∈ V_int(T) := V(T) \ {root of T}`.
M-C-B's "internal" excludes the root vertex but **includes leaves** —
so leaves of `T` are accessible terms. (Verified against the worked
example on book p. 35, inline in §1.2 just before §1.2.1.)

## Representation: 5-constructor enum

A `CutShape T` for `T : TraceTree α β` records cut choices position-
by-position. Leaves admit only the trivial pass-through (no edges to
cut); nodes have four choices based on (cut left edge?) × (cut right
edge?). The antichain condition (M-C-B Def 1.2.6: no two cuts on the
same root-leaf path) is baked in by construction.

## Layer status

`Mathlib.Combinatorics.HopfAlgebra.ConnesKreimer.AdmissibleCut`. This
file is part of the Stage 0.5 hoist out of `Theories/Syntax/Minimalist/Hopf/`

upstream reuse this construction over arbitrary leaf-and-trace-label types. -/

/-- An admissible cut on a tree `T : TraceTree α β`.

    **Trace-extraction restriction (substrate fix for coassoc).** The cuts that
    EXTRACT a child subtree (`bothCut`, `onlyLeftCut`, `onlyRightCut`) require
    that child to NOT be a `.trace` marker (`IsNotTrace`). Without this
    restriction, iterated cuts on the remainder of an outer cut would
    accumulate `.trace`-of-`.trace` nesting, breaking the cuts-of-cuts bijection
    (M-C-B Lemma 1.2.10 / Foissy 2002 §2). With scalar trace labels (β not
    DecoratedTree), this nesting is what causes the basis cardinality to blow
    up; the `IsNotTrace` constraint prevents it.

    The `bothRecurse` constructor — which doesn't extract anything at this node —
    has no restriction; it composes recursively into the children's CutShapes.

/-! ## §4: Pruned forest `F_v` and remainder `T/^c F_v`

For an admissible cut `c : CutShape T`:
- `cutForest c : TraceForest α β` is the multiset of subtrees being extracted
  (M-C-B's F_v in Def 1.2.4 / Lemma 1.2.7)
- `remainder c : TraceTree α β` is the tree obtained by replacing
  each cut subtree with a `.trace` leaf labelled with what was cut
  (M-C-B's T/^c F_v in Def 1.2.4)

The trace label is a SCALAR `β` (not a recursive subtree). For `β = Unit`,
the trace marker carries no information; for `β = α`, it carries a head
label per @cite{marcolli-skigin-2025} Definition 10.3. -/

    T with each cut subtree replaced by a `.trace` leaf. The trace label
    is `default : β` from `[Inhabited β]` (e.g., `()` for the bialgebra
    layer with `β = Unit`). For richer trace labels (head function, etc.),
    use a different projection at the bialgebra boundary; this default
    suffices for `Hc R α := AddMonoidAlgebra R (TraceForest α Unit)`.

    children getting wrapped with `.trace` here are guaranteed to NOT already
    be `.trace` markers. -/

    that linguistic Merge uses, per M-C-B Definition 1.3.4 p. 42:
    "consider the coproduct Δ = Δ^d of (1.2.8)").

    Returns `Option (TraceTree α β)` because cutting both children of a
    node leaves a vertex with no children — neither a leaf nor a binary
    node. Such a vertex collapses (returns `None`); upstream binders absorb
    the collapse via edge contraction:

    - At a node, if BOTH children's deletion-remainder collapse, the
      node itself collapses.
    - At a node, if ONE child collapses, the other becomes the
      remainder (the parent's edge to the survivor is "contracted",
      effectively absorbing the parent into the survivor).

    This handling is faithful to M-C-B Def 1.2.5's "unique maximal
    binary rooted tree obtainable via contraction." -/

/-! ## §6: Position vs. value: cutForest is NOT injective (and that's correct)

A natural question: is `cutForest : CutShape T → TraceForest α β` injective
(per M-C-B Lemma 1.2.7's bijection)? The answer is **no in general**,
and that's actually consistent with M-C-B.

Counterexample: take `T = .node X X` (same subtree X on both sides).
Then `bothRecurse cl cr` and `bothRecurse cr cl` are syntactically
distinct `CutShape T` values but produce identical `cutForest`
multisets (multiset addition is commutative). More generally,
whenever subtrees on the left and right have shared substructure,
swapping cut choices gives the same value-level multiset but distinct
positional cut data.

This is consistent with M-C-B because Eq (1.2.8)'s `Σ_{F_v}` ranges
over **positional** subforests of disjoint accessible terms (per
M-C-B's "disjoint in T" qualifier in Lemma 1.2.7), not over value-
deduplicated multisets. Two positionally-distinct cuts that happen to
extract the same value-multiset CONTRIBUTE TWO TERMS to the sum.

Our `Σ c : CutShape T` correctly enumerates positionally — `CutShape T`
is the **positional cut data**. The map `cutForest` then projects
position to value; non-injectivity here corresponds to
multiplicities in the value-multiset projection of the sum, which is
exactly what M-C-B's sum is supposed to track.

**Bottom line**: don't try to prove `cutForest` injective; the sum
over CutShape is the right semantics, and value-level collisions are
genuine multiplicity contributions. -/

/-! ## §7: `IsNotTrace` is preserved by `remainder`

For `cl : CutShape l`, `remainder cl` has the same top-level constructor as `l`
(modulo `.trace` markers introduced for extracted children). In particular,
`IsNotTrace l` holds iff `IsNotTrace (remainder cl)` holds — the only `.trace`-
shaped tree's only CutShape is `atTrace`, whose remainder is the same `.trace`. -/
