# Contracting unary vertices of a rose tree

`contractUnary` collapses every unary vertex (one with exactly one child) into that
child — the series reduction normalizing a rooted tree to one with no unary vertices.
Each contracted vertex disappears whole, so the vertex count drops by exactly the
number of unary vertices.

## Main definitions

* `RoseTree.contractUnary`, `RoseTree.numUnary`: the contraction and the unary-vertex
  count, with descents to the `Nonplanar` quotient.

## Main results

* `RoseTree.numUnary_contractUnary`: the result has no unary vertices.
* `RoseTree.contractUnary_eq_self_iff`: the fixed points are exactly the unary-free
  trees; hence `contractUnary_idem`.
* `RoseTree.numNodes_contractUnary_add_numUnary`: each contraction removes one vertex.

`[UPSTREAM]` candidate alongside the `RoseTree` carrier.
