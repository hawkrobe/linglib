# ⚠️ LEGACY — RESTORED SHIM (2026-05-13)

This file was deleted at commit `e0876460` (0.230.913 — "MCB substrate Phase A.5-A.6
+ hard delete of legacy CK substrate") and restored on 2026-05-13 because the
consumer migration that was supposed to follow the deletion never happened.
Merge stack files (`Theories/Syntax/Minimalist/Merge/*`) and downstream consumers
broke on clean build for ~weeks; this restoration unblocks them.

**Will be re-deleted when Phase D lands** per `scratch/mcb_full_architecture.md`:
general n-ary Δ^c via cuts-of-cuts on `RootedTree α [Inhabited α]`, with consumers
migrated to use `RootedTree.ConnesKreimer R T` + `comulCAlgHomP` / `Planar (α ⊕ β)`.

**Do not extend, do not add new consumers, do not deepen the parallel substrate.**
The new substrate at `Linglib/Core/Algebra/RootedTree/` and `Linglib/Core/Combinatorics/RootedTree/`
is the canonical destination.

# Decorated Binary Rooted Trees @cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025} @cite{foissy-2002}

The decorated binary rooted tree carrier of the Connes-Kreimer-style
Hopf algebra of (binary nonplanar) decorated forests, parameterized
over a leaf type `α : Type*`.

## Substrate choice

`DecoratedTree α` is a single inductive with three constructors:

- `leaf  : α → DecoratedTree α`
- `trace : DecoratedTree α → DecoratedTree α`
- `node  : DecoratedTree α → DecoratedTree α → DecoratedTree α`

Mathematically this is the free term algebra over the signature
`{leaf : α → 1, trace : 1 → 1, node : 1 × 1 → 1}`. The carrier shape
is the standard one for *decorated* Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebras
(cf. @cite{foissy-2002} on planar decorated rooted-tree Hopf algebras
H^D_{P,R} — generalizing the non-planar Connes-Kreimer H^D_R). Note:
M-C-B themselves do not cite Foissy directly; they appeal to the
Connes-Kreimer-Feynman-graph proof for coassociativity (book p. 38
references). The Foissy attribution here is the formaliser's reading
of the closest mathematical predecessor for the *decorated* binary
case. The `Mul (DecoratedTree α)` instance (via `node`) recovers
`FreeMagma`-style `*` notation; the recursor `recOnMul` mirrors
`FreeMagma.recOnMul`.

## Two faithfulness gaps re. M-C-B Definition 1.1.1

@cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025} Definition 1.1.1 says the
abstract syntactic-object set is a free non-associative *commutative*
magma `Magma_{na,c}(SO_0, M)`. mathlib's `FreeMagma α` is the
non-commutative version. Two distinct gaps relative to mathlib
infrastructure:

**Gap 1 — Planar vs nonplanar.** `DecoratedTree α` inherits the
planar structure: `node l r ≠ node r l` as an equality. A faithful
encoding would `Quotient` by `node l r ~ node r l`. Proofs that need
the abstract identification require that quotient; this file does
not develop it (see CHANGELOG 0.230.655's note on the in-flight
`FreeCommMagma` work). M-C-B handle this gap implicitly via
equivalence-class drawings — book p. 23 example shows
α∧β∧γ = α∧γ∧β as the same nonplanar tree.

**Gap 2 — Set vs multiset (the singleton-collapse).** M-C-B p. 25
§1.1.3.1's "very mild" remark refers SPECIFICALLY to the
set-vs-multiset clash for syntactic objects: since trees are binary
(not n-ary for n ≥ 3), repeated-label ambiguity at a single node is
limited, and they explicitly identify {a, a} with {a} for binary
nodes. (This is the `idem` axiom the comm-quotient does NOT add by
default.) NOT to be confused with Gap 1 — this is a separate concern.

For workspaces (`Forest α := Multiset (DecoratedTree α)`), the
multiset structure handles the analogous gap at the workspace level
automatically. Both gaps remain open at the *intra-tree* level until
the comm-quotient + singleton-collapse are wired in (Stage 4a/4b per
`scratch/mcb_stage1_plan.md`).

## Trace constructor and self-reference

Per @cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025} Definition 1.2.4, the
contraction quotient T/^c T_v carries a trace label *T_v* that holds
the contracted subtree as data. The recursive `.trace t` constructor
here is retained for **CI-side / FormCopy** consumers — operations
that need to inspect the original moved subtree at the
Conceptual-Intensional interface. Per @cite{marcolli-skigin-2025}
§10.1 (which clarifies and disambiguates the brief discussion in
M-C-B's §1.3), the recursive payload is **not** required for the
bialgebra structure itself: M-S Lemma 10.4 proves coassociativity of
Δ^c with scalar trace labels (see `TraceTree α β` below). The
recursive `DecoratedTree α → DecoratedTree α` shape is kept here
because FormCopy and similar linguistic operations consume the
contracted subtree as data; the bialgebra carrier (`Hc R α`) projects
through `.anon` to a scalar-trace `TraceTree α Unit`.

    - `trace t` — a trace leaf carrying a subtree `t` as data
      (treated as a leaf for tree-traversal; `t` is metadata)
    - `node l r` — a binary internal vertex with children `l` and `r`

    The `trace` constructor enables nested decorations (a trace can
    contain trace-bearing trees), which is essential for iterated

For Connes-Kreimer coassociativity to hold (M-C-B Lemma 1.2.10), cuts that
extract a child subtree (`bothCut`, `onlyLeftCut`, `onlyRightCut` on `.node`)
must NOT be allowed when the relevant child is a `.trace` marker. Without this
restriction, iterated cuts on the remainder accumulate `.trace (.trace _)`
nesting, breaking the cuts-of-cuts bijection — see `scratch/mcb_stage1_plan.md`
or `Linglib/Scratch/CoassocCheck.lean` for the full analysis.

/-! ## TraceTree — trace label as a first-class scalar

The `.trace t` constructor of `DecoratedTree α` carries the contracted
subtree `t` as metadata, motivated by the linguistic FormCopy operation
(@cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025} Definition 1.2.4). However, the
Hopf algebra coassociativity proof in the M-C-B book Lemma 1.2.10 appeals
to @cite{connes-kreimer-1998} for the Feynman-graph CK Hopf algebra,
where contraction markers carry no recursive payload. Treating `.trace t`
literally as a data-carrying basis element of `Hc R α` would break
coassociativity: iterated coproducts produce `.trace _` markers whose
contents differ between the two iteration orders, even though the
underlying combinatorial "3-coloring" structures match. (A concrete
counterexample for `T = .node l (.node a b)` is verified kernel-checked
in `scratch/SlotThreeMismatch.lean`.)

@cite{marcolli-skigin-2025} §10.1 ("Labels of traces of movement")
explicitly addresses this. M-S frame their §10 as clarifying and
disambiguating M-C-B's §1.3, observing: the trace label "in fact does
not have to retain the full structure of T_v as a syntactic object …
the extracted term T_v is still present, on the other side of the
coproduct, so that information is not lost." Their Definition 10.3
redefines the trace label as a scalar `α̅_{h_T(v)}` — the *struck-through*
head label, an element of `̄SO₀ := {̄α | α ∈ SO₀}` (a **disjoint marked
copy** of the leaf alphabet, NOT just an element of `SO₀`). The leaf
alphabet is enlarged to the disjoint union `SO₀ ⊔ ̄SO₀`. M-S Lemma 10.4
proves Δ^c coassociativity under this scheme via **head-function
transparency**: `h_{T_v}(w) = h_T(w)` for `w ∈ T_v`, so iterated traces
all resolve to the same label as the original subtree.

`TraceTree α β` realizes the disjoint-leaf-and-trace shape with a
polymorphic trace-label type `β`:
- `.leaf (a : α)`: a leaf carrying a label of type `α`.
- `.trace (b : β)`: a trace marker carrying a scalar label of type `β`
  (NOT a recursive subtree). The constructor distinction encodes the
  disjoint-copy structure of `SO₀ ⊔ ̄SO₀`: even when `β = α`, the
  `.trace`-vs-`.leaf` distinction marks the struck-through copy.
- `.node l r`: an internal binary vertex.

`Hc R α` is fixed to `Multiset (TraceTree α Unit)` — the **simplest**
realization, where trace labels carry no information at all. This is
sufficient for coassociativity (M-S Lemma 10.4 holds vacuously when the
extractor is constant) but is a strict simplification of M-S, who use a
non-trivial scalar label via the head function. The polymorphism stays
available so linguistic-layer code can use `TraceTree α α` (M-S aligned)
or richer label types when head-function infrastructure lands.

The projection `DecoratedTree.anon (h : DecoratedTree α → β)` takes an
extractor function for the trace label. For `Hc`-level coassoc to behave,
`h` must be **transparent under contraction**: `h (.trace t) = h t`.
This is an explicit hypothesis on theorems that need it (mathlib idiom:
unbundled function plus side-condition, since trace-label choice is not
canonical). Examples of transparent extractors:
- `fun _ => ()` (trivial) — used by `Hc R α` itself.
- `DecoratedTree.leftmostLeaf` (when defined) — recursive descent through
  `.trace`, picking the leftmost actual leaf label.
- The M-S head function (when head-function infrastructure lands).

The labelled `.trace t` data remains available at the `DecoratedTree`
level for linguistic operations (FormCopy, cancellation-of-deeper-copies). -/

/-! ### Migration bridge to `FreeCommMagma`

The planar `TraceTree α β` is being migrated to the nonplanar
`FreeCommMagma (α ⊕ β)` per the M-C-B (2025) Definition 1.1.1
"free, non-associative, **commutative** magma" identification of
syntactic objects (book p. 22, Remark 1.1.2). Linguistically-essential
operations like phonological yield and head projection move to a
separate Linearization theory; the `TraceTree` carrier becomes a
"chosen planar embedding" rather than the primary representation.

The coercion below is a **one-way bridge** (planar → nonplanar):
`TraceTree.toFreeCommMagma` forgets the left/right child order at
each `.node`, mapping it onto the unordered `FreeCommMagma.mul`. The
reverse direction requires a linearization choice (Phase 2 of the
migration) and is not single-valued. -/

/-- **Migration bridge**: forget the planar order. Maps `TraceTree α β`
    into `FreeCommMagma (α ⊕ β)` by sending `.leaf a` to `of (.inl a)`,

    * r.toFreeCommMagma` (multiplication is commutative on the target,
    so the planar choice is forgotten).

    This is a one-way coercion intended for the migration window: the
    nonplanar carrier is the canonical M-C-B-aligned representation;
    the planar `TraceTree` survives only as a chosen planar embedding
    consumed by Linearization. -/

/-! ## §6: Forest size measures (b₀, α, σ)
@cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025} §1.2 + §1.6.1

Three counting functions on a `TraceForest α β`, parallel to `degForest`
and `sizeForest` above:

- **`b₀(F)` — number of components**: cardinality of `F` as a multiset.
- **`α(F)` — accessible terms**: per MCB Def 1.2.2 (the "more precise
  discussion" of the §1.1 prose-definition on book p. 21: "the accessible
  terms of a syntactic object T are the subtrees T_v, with v a non-root
  vertex of T"), `α(F) = Σ_T #Acc(T)`. For a `TraceTree`, every vertex
  is the root of some subtree, so `#Acc(T) = #V(T) - 1 = T.size - 1`.
- **`σ(F) = b₀(F) + α(F)`** (MCB §1.6.1).

Lemma 1.6.3 (book §1.6.2) supplies counting identities for these under
`merge` (the `.node` constructor); the merge-side identities matching MCB
eq. 1.6.5 / 1.6.6 are proven below. The cut-quotient identities (eq. 1.6.7-
1.6.10) need substrate from `AdmissibleCut.lean` and live in
`Theories/Syntax/Minimalist/Merge/MinimalYield.lean`.

/-! ## §7: Δ^c-aware forest measures (αᶜ, σᶜ)
@cite{marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025} §1.6.2

Trace-aware analogs of `accCount` and `sigma` for the Δ^c counting (MCB
Lemma 1.6.3 eq. 1.6.8 and 1.6.10). These count trace markers as zero
contribution to "accessible terms" — implementing MCB's "cancellation of
the deeper copy" principle (book p. 65-66). For trace-free trees,
`accCountC = accCount`; the difference shows up only in contraction-
quotient trees.

Distinction from `accCount`:
- `accCount T = T.size - 1` (every non-root vertex counted)
- `accCountC T = T.nonTraceSize - 1` (only non-trace non-root vertices)

For trace-free trees `nonTraceSize = size`, so `accCountC = accCount`.
The two measures diverge on `T/^c T_v` (a trace marker for the cancelled
copy), which is exactly where MCB's eq. 1.6.8/1.6.10 use them. -/
