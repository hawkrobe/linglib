# Erotetic reasoning with alternatives

The erotetic theory of reasoning of Koralus and Mascarenhas treats the premises of a deductive
task asymmetrically: a disjunction-like first premise raises a set of alternatives, a question;
the second premise is a hint toward an answer; the reasoner selects the alternative the hint
bears on and reads conclusions off the selected alternative, a mental-models analog of
conjunction elimination. A `Problem` is the alternative set with its hint; a conclusion is
`Illusory` under a selection rule when some selected alternative yields it although it does not
follow from the premises' classical content. The selection rule is a parameter: `Matches` is
the exact content overlap of the mental-models and erotetic literature, the alternative
carrying the hint's content, and `Overlaps` is bare consistency with the hint; probabilistic
rules such as selection by confirmation are study-specific refinements. The schema `indirect`
covers the classical illusory inference from disjunction as the special case where the hint is
the first conjunct itself (`disjunction_eq_indirect`), and matching provably undergenerates
the indirect case while certifying the classical one.

The generators formalized with the schema are the three the literature has established:
disjunction, indefinites (one alternative per witness), and the epistemic modal *might*, whose
attentive content is the alternative pair of the prejacent with the tautology.

Consumers: `Studies/SableMeyerMascarenhas2022` (the indirect schema, the selection-rule
contrast, and selection by confirmation) and `Studies/BadeEtAl2022` (the modal instances and
the experiment-facing anatomy). The full Koralus–Mascarenhas deduction system over truth-maker
semantics is not formalized.

## Implementation notes

* Alternatives are bare `Set W` propositions; `Matches p := p ⊆ hint` renders exact content
  overlap semantically, with no syntactic conjunct structure.
* Under the weak `Overlaps` rule the symmetric conclusion of the classical schema is also
  certified (`disjunction_illusory_overlaps_right`): the rule records attention, not the
  asymmetry, which comes from the selection theory.

Conditioning a measure on the schema's premises cannot separate the attractive conclusion from
the symmetric one: the premises distribute, and the two posteriors agree exactly when the
