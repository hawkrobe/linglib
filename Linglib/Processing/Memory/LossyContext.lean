# Memory processes

This file defines the memory process of [futrell-gibson-levy-2020]'s lossy-context surprisal. A
memory process encodes a context as a distribution over memory representations and predicts the
next word from the representation alone, so that the representation mediates all information
flow from the context to the prediction. The difficulty of a word in a context is its expected
surprisal over the representations the context can produce, and the average difficulty of the
process under a language model and a context prior averages it over contexts and the words they
predict.

A process whose encoder is deterministic and whose predictor, read through the encoder, is a
language model loses no information, and its difficulty is that model's surprisal: surprisal
theory is the lossless special case.

## Main definitions

* `MemoryProcess`: an encoder `Kernel C R` and a predictor `Kernel R W`.
* `MemoryProcess.expectedSurprisal`, `MemoryProcess.averageDifficulty`.
* `MemoryProcess.IsLosslessFor`: the process realizes a language model through a deterministic
  summary of the context.

## Main results

* `MemoryProcess.expectedSurprisal_of_dirac`, `MemoryProcess.expectedSurprisal_of_bernoulli`:
  expected surprisal under a point-mass and under a two-point encoder.
* `MemoryProcess.expectedSurprisal_eq_surprisal_of_lossless`.
