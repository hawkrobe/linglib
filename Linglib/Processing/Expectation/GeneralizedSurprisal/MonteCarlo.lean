# Monte Carlo estimation of generalized surprisal

Generalized surprisal warps an expectation over the alternatives a language model samples, and
[giulianelli-opedal-cotterell-2024] estimate it by warping the mean score of finitely many sampled
alternatives. The estimator is consistent when the warping is continuous: by the strong law of
large numbers the mean score converges almost surely to the expected score
(`ae_tendsto_mcEstimate`). With the identity warping it is also unbiased
(`integral_mcEstimate_id`).

## Main definitions

* `mcEstimate`: the warped mean score of the first `N` alternatives.

## Main results

* `ae_tendsto_mcEstimate`: consistency for a warping continuous at the expected score.
* `integral_mcEstimate_id`: unbiasedness for the identity warping.

## Implementation notes

* The alternatives are random variables on a probability space, each distributed as the
  language model in the context; the paper draws them by ancestral sampling. Consistency assumes
  them pairwise independent, the hypothesis of mathlib's strong law.
* Consistency needs the warping continuous only at the expected score, where the paper assumes
  it continuous.
