# Form and meaning coding for the discriminative lexicon

This file defines how linguistic objects enter the discriminative lexicon, following chapters 4
and 5 of Heitmeier, Chuang and Baayen.

A form is a string of symbols. Its cues are the `n`-grams of the string padded with one
boundary symbol on each side (`#a aa ap p#`, `#aa aap ap#`), and its row of the form matrix `C`
is the indicator of those cues over the cue inventory, so `C` holds only ones and zeros. The
padding is one boundary symbol whatever the width, unlike the `k − 1` symbols of strictly local
grammars (`boundary`), so the model's trigrams are not the 3-factors of subregular phonology. A
meaning is a multiset of atomic semantic primitives, a lexeme together with its inflectional
functions, and conceptualization builds its vector as the sum of the primitives' vectors, so
that a novel inflected word is conceptualized from known primitives. Conceptualization is
additive in the multiset by construction, which is what makes a linear mapping respect
proportional analogy (`Studies/HeitmeierChuangBaayen2026`).

## Main definitions

* `cues k w`: the `k`-gram cues of the string `w`.
* `multiHot inv p`: the indicator row over an inventory `inv` of the units satisfying `p`.
* `cueVector k inv w`: the row of `C` for `w`.
* `conceptualize emb`: the additive map from primitive multisets to meaning vectors.
* `imputed σ ε`: the meaning of a lexeme at a cell, the lexeme's vector plus the cell's.
