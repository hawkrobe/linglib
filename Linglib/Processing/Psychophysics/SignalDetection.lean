# Signal detection theory

Signal detection theory accounts for a yes-no judgment as a criterion on a noisy decision variable
([macmillan-creelman-2005]). A trial holds a signal or only noise, the observer receives an
observation whose law depends on which, and it responds "yes" when the observation exceeds a
criterion `k`. The experiment is a kernel `P : Kernel Bool ℝ` from the state of the trial to the
law of the observation, and the observer's response rates are the masses its two laws give to
`(k, ∞)`: the hit rate on signal trials and the false-alarm rate on noise trials. In a
forced-choice task one interval holds the signal and the rest noise, and the observer picks the
interval with the largest observation, so the proportion correct is the choice probability of
the signal interval in the random utility model of the intervals' laws (`forcedChoice`).

The models [macmillan-creelman-2005] compare are location experiments (`locationExperiment`): a
noise law `ν` shifted by `δ / 2` on signal trials and by `-(δ / 2)` on noise trials, the
sensitivity `δ` being the distance between the two laws. The normal model takes `ν` standard
normal, and the Choice Theory of [luce-1959] takes it logistic ([macmillan-creelman-2005], ch. 4,
p. 98). In every location experiment the hit rate of a criterion is the false-alarm rate of the
criterion lower by `δ` (`hitRate_eq_falseAlarmRate_sub`). For a symmetric `ν`, such as both of
these, the receiver operating characteristic on axes transformed by the quantile function of `ν` is
therefore a line of unit slope, `δ` above the chance line. In the normal model the axes are
z-scores: whatever the criterion `k`, the sensitivity is `d' = z(H) - z(F)` and
`k = -(z(H) + z(F)) / 2` (`probit_hitRate_sub_probit_falseAlarmRate`,
`probit_hitRate_add_probit_falseAlarmRate`). The likelihood ratio of signal to noise at an
observation `x` is `exp (d' * x)` (`likelihoodRatio_gaussianReal`), and the two-alternative forced
choice is the binary probit rule, with proportion correct `Φ (d' / √2)`
(`forcedChoice_one_gaussianReal`).

## Main definitions

* `SignalDetection.hitRate`, `SignalDetection.falseAlarmRate`: the response rates of a criterion.
* `SignalDetection.forcedChoice`: the proportion correct of a forced-choice task.
* `SignalDetection.locationExperiment`: the experiment of a noise law at a sensitivity.

## Main results

* `SignalDetection.hitRate_eq_falseAlarmRate_sub`: in a location experiment the hit rate of `k` is
  the false-alarm rate of `k - δ`.
* `SignalDetection.falseAlarmRate_lt_hitRate`: at positive sensitivity the receiver operating
  characteristic lies above the chance line.
* `SignalDetection.probit_hitRate_sub_probit_falseAlarmRate`: in the normal model
  `z(H) = z(F) + d'`, [macmillan-creelman-2005]'s eq. (1.8).
* `SignalDetection.probit_hitRate_add_probit_falseAlarmRate`: in the normal model the criterion is
  `c = -(z(H) + z(F)) / 2`, [macmillan-creelman-2005]'s eq. (2.1).
* `SignalDetection.likelihoodRatio_gaussianReal`: the likelihood ratio of the normal model.
* `SignalDetection.forcedChoice_one_gaussianReal`: the two-alternative forced choice of the normal
  model.

## TODO

* The slope of the receiver operating characteristic at a criterion is the likelihood ratio there
  ([macmillan-creelman-2005], ch. 2); for the normal model this needs the derivative of `Φ`.
* The optimal criterion is the Bayes estimator of the experiment under 0-1 loss, and a larger
  sensitivity gives a more informative experiment in the order of
  `Linglib/Core/Probability/Decision/Blackwell.lean`.
* Choice Theory's logistic model needs the logistic distribution, and its yes-no and
  forced-choice predictions are [luce-1959]'s section 2.E.
