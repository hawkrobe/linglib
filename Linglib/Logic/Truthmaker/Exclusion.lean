# Exclusion

This file defines exclusion between states and what it determines in unilateral truthmaker
semantics. Given an exclusion relation, two states conflict when a part of one excludes a part of
the other, and a state is possible when it does not conflict with itself. Plebani, Rosella and
Saitta, and independently Champollion and Bernard, derive possibility in this way, while Fine
takes the possible states as given. Fine constrains exclusion by three conditions and negates a
proposition `P` by fusing states that together exclude its verifiers. This gives the exclusive
negation `−P`, and its regular closure, the exclusionary negation `∼P`.

## Main definitions

* `Truthmaker.Conflict excl s t`: some part of `s` excludes some part of `t`.
* `Truthmaker.possible excl`: the states that do not conflict with themselves.
* `Truthmaker.PossibleFusion excl`: two possible states that do not conflict have a possible
  fusion.
* `Truthmaker.UpwardExclusion`, `Truthmaker.DownwardExclusion`, `Truthmaker.NullExclusion`:
  Fine's conditions on exclusion.
* `Truthmaker.Excludes excl Q P`: every verifier of `Q` excludes a verifier of `P`, and every
  verifier of `P` is excluded by a verifier of `Q`.
* `Truthmaker.exclusiveNeg`, `Truthmaker.exclusionaryNeg`: Fine's negations `−P` and `∼P`.
* `Truthmaker.ClassicalExclusion excl P`: Fine's classical exclusion over the possible states `P`.

## Main results

* `Truthmaker.isConjunctivePart_iff_excludes`: containment is exclusion with parthood in place of
  exclusion.
* `Truthmaker.mem_possible_iff_forall`: a state is possible exactly when no two of its parts
  conflict.
* `Truthmaker.coe_upperClosure_exclusionaryNeg`: under Upward Exclusion, the states containing a
  verifier of `∼P` are those that conflict with every verifier of `P`, the polar of `P` under
  conflict.
* `Truthmaker.sSup_exclusiveNeg`: the subject-matter of `−P` is the fusion of the excluders of
  verifiers of `P`.
* `Truthmaker.forall_exists_conflict_iff`: the half of Downward Exclusion that rules out emergent
  exclusion says that a state conflicting with a fusion conflicts with one of its members.
* `Truthmaker.exclusionaryNeg_singleton`: the negation of a single state is the regular closure of
  its excluders.
* `Truthmaker.exclusionaryNeg_regularClosure`: negation does not see regular closure.
* `Truthmaker.exclusionaryNeg_regularClosure_iUnion`, `Truthmaker.exclusionaryNeg_iSups`: the de
  Morgan laws for the exclusionary negation.
* `Truthmaker.exclusionaryNeg_exclusionaryNeg`: double negation holds of every regular proposition
  if it holds of every single state.
* `Truthmaker.ClassicalExclusion.exclusive`, `Truthmaker.ClassicalExclusion.exhaustive`: under
  classical exclusion a single state paired with its negation is exclusive and exhaustive.
* `Truthmaker.Canonical.possible_excl`: in the canonical space, where a literal excludes its mirror
  image, the derived possibility is Fine's consistency.
* `Truthmaker.RedBlueGreen.exclusionaryNeg_exclusionaryNeg_ne`: double negation can fail.

## Implementation notes

Fine's published Downward Exclusion condition omits the regular closure of the excluders, which
Champollion and Bernard report as a typo. It is stated here with the closure. The de Morgan laws
are proved by computing the inexact verifiers and the subject-matter of each side, which determine
a regular proposition (`Truthmaker.regularClosure_eq_iff`). Fine states that negation does not see
regular closure for regular propositions only and his de Morgan laws for regular ones, but they
hold without regularity. The law for conjunctions needs no distributivity, only that the conjuncts
have verifiers and that the null state verifies none of them.
