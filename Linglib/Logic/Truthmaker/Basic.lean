# Truthmaker content

This file defines conjunctive parthood, the containment relation of Kit Fine's theory of
truthmaker content. States are ordered by parthood, with fusion as join, and a unilateral
proposition is the set of states that exactly verify it, so a proposition over states `S` is a
`Set S`. Conjunction is the pointwise fusion `s ⊻ t`, disjunction is the union `s ∪ t`, and
Fine's entailment of `t` by `s` is the inclusion `s ⊆ t`.

A state inexactly verifies `s` when some part of it exactly verifies `s`, that is, when it lies
in `upperClosure s`. Inexact verification obeys the classical clauses: `upperClosure_sups` and
`upperClosure_union` say that the inexact verifiers of `s ⊻ t` and `s ∪ t` are the common and the
pooled inexact verifiers of `s` and `t`.

## Main definitions

* `Truthmaker.IsConjunctivePart t s`: every verifier of `s` contains a verifier of `t`, and every
  verifier of `t` is part of a verifier of `s`.
* `Truthmaker.regularClosure`: the closure operator sending `s` to the states that contain a
  verifier of `s` and are part of the fusion of its verifiers. Its closed sets are Fine's regular
  propositions, and the regular closure of `s ∪ t` is his disjunction in a regular domain.

## Main results

* `Truthmaker.isConjunctivePart_iff`: conjunctive parthood compares upper and lower closures.
* `Truthmaker.IsConjunctivePart.antisymm`: conjunctive parthood is antisymmetric on convex
  propositions.
* `Truthmaker.isConjunctivePart_singleton_right_iff`: parts of a single state are its parts.
* `Truthmaker.isConjunctivePart_sups_left`: a conjunct is a conjunctive part of a conjunction.
* `Truthmaker.isConjunctivePart_union_left_iff`: `s` contains `s ∨ t` only when every verifier of
  `t` is part of a verifier of `s`, so disjunction introduction fails for containment.
* `Truthmaker.isConjunctivePart_iff_sups_eq`: a closed convex proposition contains `t` exactly
  when conjoining `t` leaves it unchanged.
* `Truthmaker.isClosed_regularClosure_iff`: the regular propositions are those closed under
  nonempty fusions and convex.
* `Truthmaker.isConjunctivePart_regularClosure_iff`: regular closure does not change containment.
* `Truthmaker.regularClosure_sups`: in a distributive space, regular closure distributes over
  conjunction.
* `Truthmaker.regularClosure_union_sups`: disjunction distributes over conjunction in a regular
  domain.

## Implementation notes

Fine defines conjunctive parthood only between propositions with a verifier. The relation here is
total, and the empty proposition is a conjunctive part only of itself. Fine's closure condition
asks for closure under arbitrary nonempty fusions, which `isClosed_regularClosure_iff` states and
of which `SupClosed` is the finitary version. Fine states the distribution of regular closure over conjunction, and the distribution of
disjunction over conjunction, for regular propositions, but his proofs apply them to unions and
to sets of excluders that need not be regular. They are stated here for arbitrary nonempty
propositions. His distributivity assumption is mathlib's `Order.Frame`.
