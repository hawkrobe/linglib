# Qualitative probability

Comparative probability reads a relation `r a b` on a Boolean algebra `α` as "`a` is at
least as likely as `b`". This file states the axioms of the subject as unbundled mixin
classes on such a relation, in the style of `IsTrans`, and collects de Finetti's system, the
standard base of comparative probability that Kraft, Pratt and Seidenberg and Scott build
on, as the class `IsQualitativeProbability`: a monotone, non-trivial and qualitatively
additive (`a ≿ b ↔ a \ b ≿ b \ a`) total preorder.

A likelihood order also defines *probably*: `△a` holds when `a` is strictly more likely than
its complement, as in the logics of comparative probability that Holliday and Icard compare.
Over a monotone order the contradiction is never probable and, when the order is non-trivial,
the tautology always is; over a monotone transitive order *probably* is upward closed.
`RightUnion` is Halpern's union property `J`.

## Main definitions

* `IsLikelihoodMono`, `IsQualitativeAdditive`, `IsNontrivial`, `IsComplementReversing`: the
  axiom mixins on a relation; `Strict r` is its asymmetric part `a ≻ b`, which a transitive
  `r` absorbs on either side (`strict_of_strict_of_rel`, `strict_of_rel_of_strict`).
* `IsQualitativeProbability`: de Finetti's axioms on a relation.
* `Probably`, `RightUnion`: *probably* and Halpern's union property.

## Main statements

* `instComplementReversingOfQualitativeAdditive`: qualitative additivity implies complement
  reversal, via `bᶜ \ aᶜ = a \ b` (`compl_sdiff_compl`).

/-! ### Qualitative probabilities -/

/-- A **qualitative probability** on a Boolean algebra `α` is a relation `r`, read "`a` is at
least as likely as `b`", that is a monotone, non-trivial and qualitatively additive total
preorder: de Finetti's axioms, the base system of comparative probability. Every qualitative
probability on a finite carrier is represented by a qualitatively additive measure
(`exists_qualAddMeasure_repr`), but by a probability measure only below five atoms (Kraft,
Pratt and Seidenberg; `Completeness.lean`). -/
