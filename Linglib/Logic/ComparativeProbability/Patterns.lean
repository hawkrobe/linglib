# Validity patterns for comparative probability

Yalcin assesses semantics for *probably* and the comparative *at least as likely as* against
inference patterns: the intuitively valid V1–V12, the invalid I1–I3, and the questionable
Conjunctivitis E1. Holliday and Icard's Figure 1 keeps his labels for V1–V7, V11, V12 and
I1–I3, leaves out the conditional patterns V8–V10 and E1, and adds V13, which Lassiter defends
against symmetric fuzzy measures. Each pattern is a predicate on a likelihood relation `r` on a
Boolean algebra, with the account's modals (V6, V7) and conditional (V8–V10) as parameters; I1
is `RightUnion`. Each valid pattern is derived once from the axioms in `Defs.lean`, so a model
discharges it by instance resolution.

## Main statements

* `mustToProbably_eq_top_iff`, `probablyToMight_ne_bot_iff`: for the quantifiers `a = ⊤` and
  `a ≠ ⊥` over the epistemic space, V6 says that the tautology is probable and V7 that the
  contradiction is not.
* `strictDisjunctionIntro_iff`: over a monotone order, V13 says that an event at least as
  likely as a disjunction it is part of leaves the rest no more likely than `⊥`.
* `chancyModusTollens_iff`: V9 is V8 by contraposition, whatever the conditional.
* `equiprobabilityCollapse_of_rightUnion`, `hamblinCollapse_of_equiprobabilityCollapse`,
  `complementTransfer_of_equiprobabilityCollapse`: I1 gives I2, as Yalcin derives it, and I2
  gives I3 and V12. This is why Holliday and Icard's Fact 1 finds V12 valid for the l-lifting
  although Yalcin counts it among the failures of Kratzer's account.
