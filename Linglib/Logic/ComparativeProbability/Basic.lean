# Basic API for qualitative probabilities

On any Boolean algebra the axioms let a disjoint common context cancel and let disjoint
comparisons merge. On sets, a qualitative probability pulls back along preimages
(`Set.preimage f ⁻¹'o r`) and, when the range is not null, along images of an injection.

## Main statements

* `rel_sup_sup_right_iff`, `rel_sup_sup_right`, `rel_sup_sup`: context cancellation and
  merging.
* `isQualitativeProbability_image`: pulling back along the image of an injection.
* `not_isQualitativeProbability_of_isEmpty`: an empty carrier has no qualitative probability.
* `exists_not_rel_empty_singleton`: a finite carrier has a non-null atom.
