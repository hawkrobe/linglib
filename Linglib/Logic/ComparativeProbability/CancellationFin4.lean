/-! # Cancellation on at most four atoms

Every qualitative probability order on at most four atoms satisfies Scott cancellation, hence is
representable by a probability measure, as Kraft, Pratt and Seidenberg showed.

## Main declarations

* `ComparativeProbability.no_null_cancellation`: cancellation on `Fin 4` with no null atoms.
* `ComparativeProbability.extendLex`: the extension by a dominant world.
* `ComparativeProbability.cancellation_of_le_four`: every qualitative probability on at most four
  atoms satisfies cancellation.
* `ComparativeProbability.representable_of_le_four`: every qualitative probability on at most
  four atoms is representable.

## Implementation notes

On `Fin 4` with no null atom the proof is the merge reduction: a valid family of comparisons
whose integer sum is a single sign vector proves that comparison (`merge_to_single`), by a
four-rule recursion whose stuck case is discharged through the sign-vector core
(`Balanced.exists_antiDominating`) via `v1_tailored`. Comparisons are `Scott.lean`'s sign
vectors; two comparisons with no shared nonzero coordinate *merge* into the sign of their sum
(`merge`). Smaller sizes reach this case by the lexicographic extension, and a null atom drops
to one atom fewer, so a single induction covers every size up to four.

/-! ### Fewer atoms by lexicographic extension

A qualitative probability on `Fin n` with no null atom extends to `Fin (n + 1)` by adding a
*dominant* world: comparisons are decided first by membership of the new world, then by the
restriction to the original ones. The extension preserves the axioms and the absence of null
atoms, and reflects cancellation, so iterating it carries the no-null case of every size up to
four to `no_null_cancellation`; a null atom reduces to one atom fewer. -/

/-- `extendLex r` extends a relation on `Fin n` to `Fin (n + 1)` by a new world `Fin.last n`
    that dominates: an event holding at the new world is more likely than one that does not, and
