# Scott's theorem

Scott's representation theorem for qualitative probability on a finite set says that an order
on the subsets of a finite `W` is represented by a finitely additive probability measure iff it
satisfies finite cancellation. A comparison `A ≿ B` between disjoint sets is a **sign vector**
`v : W → SignType`, `A` its positive support and `B` its negative support, and cancellation
(`Cancellation`) says that whenever a multiset of valid comparisons sums to zero as integer
vectors, every comparison in it also holds reversed. This is equivalent to the balanced-sequence
form `FiniteCancellation` of `Cancellation.lean` (`cancellation_iff_finiteCancellation`).

The hard direction is linear-programming duality over `ℚ` (`Matrix.farkas`),
on `Fin n` and transported along `Fintype.equivFin`: the weight vectors
representing the order form a polyhedron, which is nonempty unless a Farkas
certificate exists, and a certificate is a nonnegative weighting of valid
comparisons that sums to zero yet weights a strict one. Clearing denominators
turns it into a multiset violating `Cancellation`.

## Main declarations

* `posSupport`, `negSupport`, `comparisonSum`: the sign-vector vocabulary.
* `Cancellation`: Scott's condition in sign-vector form.
* `FiniteCancellation.cancellation`, `Cancellation.finiteCancellation`,
  `cancellation_iff_finiteCancellation`: the two forms agree.
* `Cancellation.transport`: cancellation along an equivalence of carriers.
* `cancellation_implies_representable`: the Farkas direction.
* `representable_iff_cancellation`, `representable_iff_finiteCancellation`: Scott's theorem.
* `cancellation_of_null_atom`: a null atom reduces cancellation to representability one atom
  down.
