# Measures, qualitatively additive contents, and the orders they induce

A probability measure `μ` on a space in which every event is measurable orders events by
`A ≿ B ↔ μ B ≤ μ A` (`Measure.inducedGe`). A qualitatively additive measure (`QualAddMeasure`)
need not add over disjoint unions: it fixes the comparison of two events only through their
differences. A probability measure is a qualitatively additive measure through its real values
`μ.real` (`Measure.toQualAdd`), and each kind induces a qualitative probability order.

## Main definitions

* `QualAddMeasure`: qualitatively additive contents, applied as functions `m A`.
* `QualAddMeasure.ofRepr`: a normalized function representing a qualitative probability.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.inducedGe`: the order a measure induces.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.toQualAdd`: a probability measure as a qualitatively additive measure.

## Implementation notes

Events are arbitrary subsets, so the carrier is a `DiscreteMeasurableSpace`, as every finite
type with measurable singletons is. A qualitatively additive measure is not a measure, so it
stays a structure valued in an ordered field.

/-! ### Qualitatively additive measures -/

/-- A qualitatively additive measure on subsets of `W` need not add over disjoint unions; it
    satisfies only the weaker **qualitative additivity**
    `μ(A) ≥ μ(B) ↔ μ(A \ B) ≥ μ(B \ A)`. Every qualitative probability order on a finite
    carrier is represented by one (`exists_qualAddMeasure_repr`). -/
