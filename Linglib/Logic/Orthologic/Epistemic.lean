# Epistemic ortholattices

This file defines epistemic ortholattices, Holliday and Mandelkern's algebraic semantics for
`must` and `might`. A modal ortholattice is an ortholattice with a necessity operator `□`
preserving `⊓` and `⊤`, and its possibility operator `◇a = ¬□¬a` preserves `⊔` and `⊥`. It is
*T* when `□a ≤ a`, and *epistemic* when it is T and satisfies Wittgenstein's Law `¬a ∧ ◇a = 0`,
which makes "`p`, but it might be that not `p`" a contradiction.

The law is what forces ortholattices on the account. In a Boolean algebra it makes `◇¬a` entail
`¬a`, and with T it makes `□` the identity. In an ortholattice, where `a ⊓ b = ⊥` need not give
`b ≤ aᶜ`, it is compatible with a non-trivial `□`.

## Main definitions

* `Orthologic.diamondHom`: `◇a = ¬□¬a` as a map preserving `⊔` and `⊥`.
* `Orthologic.WittgensteinLaw`: `¬a ∧ ◇a = 0`.

## Main results

* `Orthologic.wittgensteinLaw_iff`: the law in the form `a ∧ ◇¬a = 0`.
* `Orthologic.wittgensteinLaw_iff_eq_bot`: with T, the law holds iff `□a = 0` implies `a = 0`.
* `Orthologic.WittgensteinLaw.disjoint_diamondHom_iterate`: with T, `a ∧ ◇ⁿ¬a = 0` for every `n`.
* `Orthologic.diamondHom_le_box_diamondHom`: 4 and `a ≤ □◇a` give 5, `◇a ≤ □◇a`.
* `Orthologic.wittgensteinLaw_iff_diamondHom_compl_le`, `Orthologic.WittgensteinLaw.eq_id`: the
  collapse in a Boolean algebra.

## Implementation notes

The paper's modal ortholattice is not a new structure: `□` is a bundled `InfTopHom L L`, since
one lattice carries many modalities, and T is the hypothesis `∀ a, box a ≤ a`. An epistemic
ortholattice is the conjunction of T and `WittgensteinLaw`. The frame semantics producing
epistemic ortholattices is `Logic/Orthologic/ModalFrame.lean`, and the logic they characterize
is `Logic/Orthologic/EpistemicOrthologic.lean`.
