# Intensional models of PIP

This file defines the models of PIP whose atoms are worlds and entities. A
world is the singleton plurality of its atom, and a family of world-relative
relations on atoms is lifted distributively to relation symbols: a symbol holds
of a world and nonempty pluralities iff it holds at that world of every tuple
of their members, and it holds of nothing whose world argument is not a world.

## Main definitions

* `Atom`, `world` — worlds and entities as atoms; a world as a plurality.
* `Model.intensional` — the distributive lifting of world-relative relations.

## Main statements

* `Model.intensional_apply₁`, `Model.intensional_apply₂` — the lifting on one
  and two arguments.
* `Term.realize_sigma_world_eq` — a summation over worlds whose body relates each
  world to the value of a local: the plurality of the worlds so related to some
  plurality; `Term.realize_sigma_world_eq_of_distributive` — for a body distributive
  in that local.

## Implementation notes

A plurality of worlds or of entities is the image `Sum.inl '' s` or `Sum.inr '' s` of a set
of them, so that the values of summations and the modal relations between them, overlap
and inclusion, reduce to relations between those sets through the injectivity of
`Sum.inl` and `Sum.inr`.
