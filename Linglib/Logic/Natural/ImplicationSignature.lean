# Implication signatures

A complement-taking operator such as *manage*, *force* or *refuse* implies something about its
complement in a positive context, in a negative context, or in both. Nairn, Condoravdi and Karttunen
classify these operators by their implication signature, the polarity of the complement each
context implies, if any: *manage* is `+/−`, since *managed to leave* implies *left* and *didn't
manage to leave* implies *didn't leave*; *force* is `+/◦`, *refuse* `−/◦`, *hesitate* `◦/+`, and a
propositional attitude such as *want* is `◦/◦`. MacCartney and Manning count nine signatures,
covering the two-way and one-way implicatives, the factives and the attitudes.

Each slot of a signature is a flat value, `◦` being `⊥`, so signatures are ordered by how much
they imply: *force*'s `+/◦` lies below *manage*'s `+/−`, and the attitudes' `◦/◦` is `⊥`.

## Main definitions

* `NaturalLogic.ImplicationSignature`: the complement's implied polarity in a positive and in a
  negative context
* `NaturalLogic.ImplicationSignature.implied`: the polarity implied in a context of a given
  polarity
