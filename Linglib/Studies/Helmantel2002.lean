# Helmantel 2002: interactions in the Dutch adpositional domain

Helmantel's dissertation sorts the core Dutch adpositions by the path specification in their
denotation. A narrow locative, *in*, *op*, *achter*, denotes a location with no path; a point
locative, *naar*, *tot*, *van*, denotes a point on a path and is inherently directional; an
extended locative, *door*, *langs*, *om*, denotes a location with extension along a path. Five
distributional tests separate the three classes, and the classification has a syntactic
correlate. Directionality sits in a functional projection above the adposition, the
directionality phrase, whose head the adposition moves to. An inherently directional adposition
checks the directionality itself and leaves its complement where the adposition selects it,
which is the prepositional order; any other adposition in a directional phrase moves its
complement to the specifier of the directionality phrase as well, which is the postpositional
order. The postpositional order is thus derived from the prepositional one, never the reverse,
and the adpositions with a postpositional use are a subset of the prepositions.

The complement in the specifier of the directionality phrase receives a path interpretation, and
that specifier is the one position from which an element leaves the phrase, Van Riemsdijk's
escape hatch. So the complement of a postpositional phrase is interpreted as the path travelled,
is extractable, and cannot be a bare mass noun, while the complement of a prepositional phrase
is a location, stays inside the phrase, and is unrestricted.

The classification is checked against the Dutch adposition fragment: the point locatives are the
grammar's inherently directional prepositions and have no postpositional use, the narrow
locatives are locational before their complement, and the grammar reads the path a narrow
locative's postposition denotes as a goal and an extended locative's as a route or a source, which
is the difference the length-modification test tracks. The two core adpositions the
classification leaves out, *met* and *zonder*, are the fragment's non-spatial ones.

## Main definitions

* `narrowLocatives`, `pointLocatives`, `extendedLocatives`: the classification of the core
  adpositions, over the fragment's entries.
* `DPRaises`, `linearization`: the complement's movement to the specifier of the directionality
  phrase, and the order of the adposition and its complement that results.

## Main results

* `linearization_eq_post_iff`, `linearization_eq_pre_of_inherent`: the postpositional order is
  a directional phrase whose adposition is not inherently directional.
* `dpRaises_iff_linearization_eq_post`: the complement is in the escape hatch, extractable and
  read as a path, exactly in the postpositional order.
* `pointLocative_linearization`, `pointLocative_directional`, `narrowLocative_locational`: the
  point locatives are the inherently directional prepositions and are never postpositional.
* `narrowLocative_direction_post`, `extendedLocative_direction_post`: the class predicts the
  path the postpositional use denotes.

## Implementation notes

* The classes are the dissertation's lists of core adpositions, as lists of fragment entries;
  the grammar's *over* 'across' is the one the dissertation classifies. The remaining, younger
  adpositions are left unclassified, as the dissertation leaves them.
* The directionality phrase is modelled by two parameters, whether it is projected and whether
  the adposition is inherently directional; the adposition's own movement to its head, the
  dimensionality requirement on the complement and its consequences for mass nouns, and the
  complex adpositional phrases of the second half of the dissertation are described here and not
  formalized.
