# Baker 1985: the Mirror Principle

[baker-1985]'s Mirror Principle (4): morphological derivations must directly reflect syntactic
derivations. Passive, causative, applicative and reciprocal formation each add an affix to the
verb and rearrange the grammatical functions of its arguments, so the order of the affixes
outward from the root is the order in which the syntactic components applied. Given the
independently known behaviour of each process, this explains why Chamorro's plural agreement
*fan-* registers the surface subject outside the passive marker, the semantic subject inside
the causative marker, and an intermediate subject between the two; why a reciprocal inside a
causative links the root's agent and patient while a causative inside a reciprocal links the
causer to the patient in Quechua but to the agent in Bemba, whose causative makes the old
subject the object; and why an applied argument becomes the passive subject only with the
applied affix inside the passive affix, so that the patient-subject reading is out in
Chi-Mwi:ni and in only in Kinyarwanda, whose passive reaches a second object independently.

Baker argues (§6) that the principle should not be stipulated but follow from an architecture
in which the morphological and the syntactic effect of a process are one thing. A
`Derivation` here is that one thing, a list of processes each with the affix it adds, from
which the word (`word`, a `Word.Tree` of morphs) and the grammatical functions (`outcomes`, a
run of `Voice` correspondences) are both read. The word determines the sequence of processes
(`word_injective`), and the universal restriction on agreement (27) holds by construction
(`registered_agree_apply`, `registered_apply_agree`).

## Main definitions

* `passiveAt`, `causativeChamorro`, `causativeQuechua`, `applicativeOf`, `reciprocalOf`: the
  GF-rules as the voice of each frame, Baker's schemas with the remaining material carried
  along.
* `Stage`: the substrate's `Voice.Stage` over the paper's participants.
* `Process`, `Grammar`, `outcomes`: the paper's processes, a language's settings, and the stages
  a sequence of processes reaches.
* `Derivation`, `word`: a derivation and the word it builds.
* `derivation`, `processes`, `initialOf`: a row's derivation, read off its segmentation.

## Main results

* `causativeChamorro_intransitive`, `reciprocalOf_np`, `passiveAt_fateOfRole`,
  `applicativeOf_isValencyIncreasing`: Baker's rules are the substrate's voices where the frames
  meet.
* `word_injective`: the morphological derivation determines the processes (§2.1).
* `registered_agree_apply`, `registered_apply_agree`: (27), an agreement morpheme inside a
  GF-rule morpheme references semantic and one outside it surface grammatical functions.
* `applied_subject_needs_applicative_first`, `applied_subject_of_applicative_first`: an applied
  argument becomes the subject only with the applied affix inside the passive affix (§4.2).
* `rows_word`, `rows_agreement`, `rows_links`, `rows_subject`: the paper's examples.

## Implementation notes

* A row's derivation is read off its segmentation: the prefixes from the root outward and then
  the suffixes, each a morph bound on its side (§2.1). The Chamorro passive *-in-* is an infix;
  the paper treats it as a prefix in a generalized sense (§3.1, §5) and the rows list it
  before the root, so it is a `Morph.pref` here.
* Baker's passive (12) keeps the demoted subject as an oblique where [creissels-2024]'s
  `Voice.passive` records it as implicit; the two agree on the fate of every core term
  (`passiveAt_fateOfRole`). His applicative (53) promotes an initial oblique where
  `Voice.applicative` introduces the applied participant.

/-! ### The universal restriction on agreement

Of the four combinations of an agreement morpheme's position relative to a GF-rule morpheme
with the level of grammatical functions it references, (27), only two occur: agreement inside
the GF-rule morpheme references semantic functions and agreement outside it surface functions.
With the morphological and the syntactic effect of a process one thing, the restriction holds
by construction ([baker-1985] §6): agreement attached before a GF-rule registers the subject
before the rule applied, and agreement attached after it the subject after. -/

/-- (27a): agreement inside the GF-rule morpheme registers the semantic subject. -/
