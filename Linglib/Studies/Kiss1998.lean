# É. Kiss (1998): Identificational Focus versus Information Focus

This file formalizes [kiss-1998]'s distinction between identificational focus, which in
Hungarian moves to the immediately preverbal position and expresses exhaustive identification,
and information focus, which stays in situ after the verb and merely marks its content as new.
Identificational focus exhaustifies the prejacent over the alternatives evoked by the
contextually given set, the `Exhaustification.exh` of [chierchia-2006], and information focus
asserts the bare prejacent. The paper's characterisation of exhaustive identification, that
the focus "is identified as the exhaustive subset of this set for which the predicate phrase
actually holds", is the theorem `exh_Ici`, and the coordination test and the dialogue test by
which the paper diagnoses exhaustivity come out as theorems on the hat-and-coat scenario of
its examples (`szabolcsi_test`, `farkas_test`). The distributional restrictions of §3 follow
from the same semantics, exhaustive identification being exclusion by identification. A
universal quantifier identifies without excluding (`exh_Ici_restrictor`), a *some*-phrase
excludes without identifying (`exh_nonempty_eq_empty`), and an additive *also* or *even*
phrase contradicts its own presupposition unless the given set has been narrowed by a prior
identification, the paper's (18) (`disjoint_exh_additive`, `additive_exh_of_notMem`).

## Implementation notes

* The scenario tracks only which of the given elements the predicate phrase holds of, so a
  world is a subset of the given set, the proposition that the predicate holds of a group
  `s` is the principal upper set `Set.Ici s`, and exhaustive identification over the given
  set `A` is the interval `Set.Icc s (s ∪ Aᶜ)`, exactly `s` among the given elements with the
  non-given ones unconstrained.
* *csak* 'only' phrases are obligatorily identificational because *csak* assigns the
  identificational focus feature (§8); the exclusion is the position's and *csak* adds an
  evaluative presupposition, which is outside this model.

## TODO

* §4 scope, §5.2 the cleft as the English realisation of identificational focus, §7 focus
  iteration and projection, and §9 the [+exhaustive] and [+contrastive] parametrisation
  across Italian, Romanian, Catalan, Greek, Arabic and Finnish.

/-! ### Distributional restrictions (§3)

Exhaustive identification is exclusion by identification. An identificational focus names
the given elements the predicate holds of and excludes the rest, and the constituents barred
from the identificational position, (17b–e), are those for which one half fails. -/
