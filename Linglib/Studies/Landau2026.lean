# Landau (2026): Silent Resumption: A New Test for Ellipsis

This file formalizes the ellipsis-internal resumption test of [landau-2026]. By the ban on vacuous
quantification ([chomsky-1982]) an Ā-operator binds into a null site only if the site has structure
at LF to host a resumptive variable, so a resumptive dependency into a null site diagnoses a surface
anaphor in the sense of [hankamer-sag-1976]. A failed extraction has two possible sources, the
paper's two reasons for the star: the site is a deep anaphor with no structure to host the
dependency, or it is a surface anaphor and ellipsis applied in the derivation bled the dependency.
An island around the site blocks extraction for a further reason, independent of ellipsis. Movement
is exposed to both of these confounds and agreement to the first; a resumptive dependency is formed
at LF and is exposed to neither. A test decides depth when the depth of a site factors through its
outcome, and a dependency decides depth exactly when it is exposed to no confound
(`Dependency.decides_iff`), so of the three only resumption does
(`Dependency.decides_iff_eq_resumption`). The paper's Hebrew nominal and prepositional ellipses,
whose domains are all islands, and its cross-linguistic mixed anaphors are rows of
`Data/Examples/Landau2026.json`. The resumption judgments are the test's predictions
(`eir_matches`), extraction fails on every Hebrew row (`hebrew_extraction_fails`), and the judgments
alone fix a deep anaphor and an ellipsis in each Hebrew domain (`hebrew_domains`) and the deep
status of the mixed anaphors (`mixed_anaphors_deep`).

## Implementation notes

A site is modelled by its depth and the confounds present at it, and a test by the dependency it
forms into the site. The paper does not say whether islands block agreement, and nothing below
depends on it: agreement fails to decide depth on the timing confound alone. The rows' texts and
judgments agree with the August 2025 preprint of the paper; the example numbers the rows carry run
two below the preprint's throughout and have not been checked against the published version. The
domain of a null site is the category of its head, `Minimalist.Cat`.

Every row is a resumptive dependency into a null site, and its judgment is the outcome of the EIR
test. The depth of the site, its domain, and whether the domain is an island are read from the
row's paper features. -/
