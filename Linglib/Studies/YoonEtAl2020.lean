# Yoon, Tessler, Goodman and Frank (2020): Polite Speech Emerges From Competing Social Goals

This file formalizes [yoon-etal-2020]'s Rational Speech Act model of polite speech, in which a
speaker trades off three goals: to be informative, to be kind, and to appear informative and
kind. In the experimental domain Ann rates Bob's poem on a scale of zero to three hearts and
answers with one of four adjectives, plain or negated. The literal listener updates a uniform
prior over states with the soft lexicon elicited in the norming experiment (`meaning`, `l0`);
the first-order speaker maximizes a mixture of informational and social utility minus cost,
`φ · ln P_L0(s | w) + (1 − φ) · E_L0[V(s)] − C(w)`, (5) (`util`, `speaker`); the pragmatic
listener infers the state and the speaker's goal weight jointly, (4) (`listener`); and the
second-order polite speaker adds presentational utility, the log probability the pragmatic
listener assigns to the projected goal weight, (3), inside the total utility (2)
(`s2Utility`, `s2Speaker`, (1)).

The first-order predictions of Figure 2 are theorems over the free parameters. A speaker with
no weight on informativity prefers "not terrible" to "terrible" exactly when the extra cost of
negation is below its social gain (`social_prefers_indirect_iff`), and prefers "amazing" to
"not amazing" at every cost (`social_prefers_positive`); a speaker with no weight on kindness
prefers the direct form at both ends of the scale (`informative_prefers_direct`,
`informative_prefers_direct_positive`), and never produces an utterance whose literal
probability at the true state is zero (`speaker_apply_eq_zero_of_meaning_eq_zero`).

## Implementation notes

* The lexicon is the acceptance count of each utterance at each state among the 49
  participants in the released norming data (`acceptance`); the paper's Bayesian data analysis
  places a Beta posterior on each acceptance probability instead. An utterance with zero
  acceptance at a state has literal probability zero there, and its score is `⊥` for every
  speaker with some weight on informativity, since the pure-social speaker alone ignores the
  literal probability.
* The listener's prior over the goal weight `φ` is uniform on the unit interval; it is
  discretized to five points (`Phi`) so that the joint prior is `uniformOn`.
* Cost is the paper's cost of negation `c` (Figure 4): a plain utterance costs 1 and a negated
  one `c`, and it sits inside the utility scaled by `α` as in (2); the released model realizes
  it as an utterance prior instead.
* Table 2's maximum a posteriori goal weights for the full model are recorded as data
  (`tableTwo`); the model comparison of Table 1 is outside the scope of the formalization.
