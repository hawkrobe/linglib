# Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995): Centering

This file formalizes the applications of centering in [grosz-joshi-weinstein-1995], "Centering:
a framework for modeling the local coherence of discourse", over the library's centering
substrate: the forward-looking centers of an utterance ranked by grammatical role, its
backward-looking center, the transitions of section 3, and the two rules of section 6. The
paper's discourses are rows of `Data.Examples.GroszJoshiWeinstein1995`; the study analyzes them
at the paper's own annotations and proves its claims about them. Section 2's contrast between
(1) and (2) comes out as continuations against retentions and a Rule 1 violation
(`coherence_contrast`); section 5 argues a single backward-looking center ranked by
grammatical role from the hamster variants (7) to (10), which Rule 1 separates into the
acceptable and the degraded (`rule1_separates_variants`), and from the subject preference of
(11) and (12) and the toy contrast of (13) and (14); section 7 applies the rules to the
violation in (15) and its repair by the shift in (16), the full noun phrase center of (17),
and the transitions annotated on (20); and section 9 compares centering with [sidner-1983] on
Sidner's example (34), where the centering account makes Jeff the center that the pronoun of
(34c) continues while Sidner's actor focus makes Carl its leading candidate
(`sidner_disagrees`).

## Implementation notes

Entities are an inductive for the paper's discourses and `Sidner1983.D34.Entity` for Sidner's;
a realization is by name or by pronoun, and grammatical roles are subject, object, and other,
ranked in that order, with embedded subjects counting as other. Under the definitions the
backward-looking center of (2) stays John throughout, so the paper's informal flipping of
aboutness surfaces as two retentions, a violation of Rule 1 at (2b), and a pronoun for an
entity outside the forward-looking centers at (2d). Rule 2 is
read through the substrate's sum of transition ranks; its restriction to pairs of utterances is
[brennan-friedman-pollard-1987]'s, as the paper's footnote notes, and its qualification of the
(15) to (16) contrast by [gordon-grosz-gilliom-1993] is recorded on the rows.

## TODO

The center of (19), realized but not directly realized, the value-free and value-loaded
interpretations of (25) to (31), and the referential uses of (32) and (33) in section 8 need a
realization relation richer than the substrate's list of directly realized entities.
