# Lassiter (2017): Graded Modality

This file formalizes chapters 4 to 8 of [lassiter-2017].

Chapters 4 to 6 place the epistemic adjectives and auxiliaries on one scale. *Likely* and
*probable* measure a proposition by its probability, on a scale bounded below by the likelihood
of a contradiction and above by that of a tautology (`likelihood_univ`, `ofOrder_probability`),
and they are relative adjectives on it. *Certain* takes the scale's maximum as its standard and
*possible* its minimum, so the three are [kennedy-2007]'s three positive forms on one closed
scale (`mem_likely_iff_relativePos`, `mem_certain_iff_maxStandardPos`,
`mem_possible_iff_minStandardPos`). A relative adjective on a closed scale is what Kennedy's
Interpretive Economy excludes, `Degree.Boundedness.Admits`, and what the book's own typology
(4.58) allows: *likely* is the counter-example of p. 82
(`coherent_and_not_admits_contextual_probability`). The distribution of *completely* and
*slightly*, which Kennedy reads off the scale, the book reads off the positive form (§4.2.9);
Kennedy's licensing is the book's quantified over the standards Interpretive Economy admits
(`licenses_iff_exists_admits`), so the two disagree exactly on adjectives like *likely*, which
license neither (`not_licensesPos_contextual`).

The auxiliaries are thresholds on the same scale (6.29), [lassiter-2015]'s `probMust` and
`probMight`, and at threshold one they are the adjectives *certain* and *possible*
(`mem_possible_iff_not_mem_certain_compl`). The ordering of the five thresholds of p. 152 makes
every item entail every weaker one (`antitone_pos`), and the strong theory, a *must* at
probability one, conflicts with that ordering (`not_strictMono_of_strong`), as does a *might* at
probability zero (`not_strictMono_of_might_zero`); with a positive threshold *might* is strictly
stronger than *possible* (`exists_mem_possible_not_mem_might`).

Chapters 7 and 8 give the scalar semantics of *good* and *ought*. Goodness is expected value, the
probability-weighted average of world values over a proposition
(`Desire.ExpectedValue.expectedValue`); it is an interval scale and intermediate on disjoint
unions. *Ought* is constrained rather than defined (`Constraints`): Sloman's Principle relates it
to goodness (an obligatory proposition is strictly better than each of its alternatives, after
[sloman-1970]), the Smith Principle restricts agglomeration to exhaustive pairs, and Weakening
closes obligation under disjunction. Sloman's Principle alone excludes conflicting oughts,
`ought φ` together with `ought ¬φ` (`Constraints.not_compl`), and the Smith Principle carries the
Smith argument from `ought (M ∨ S)` and `ought ¬M` to `ought S` (`Smith.ought_S`), on a sample
model that meets the Sloman requirements of all three. On [cariani-2016]'s four-world
counter-model to Weakening, where `A` and `B` each beat their negations in expected value but
`A ∨ B` ties with its negation, Sloman's Principle and Weakening together make `ought A` and
`ought B` incompatible (`Cariani.not_ought_and`). The scalar reading of *ought* as a threshold on
an intermediate scale derives Weakening and, given ought-exclusivity, the Smith Principle; both
derivations live with the expected-value substrate.

## Implementation notes

Probabilities are probability measures read on their real values, as in [lassiter-2015], and
the probability scale is the closed real unit interval. The p. 82 claim that the likelihood
scale, if connected, is isomorphic to a finitely additive probability holds of these measures by
construction; its measurement-theoretic direction, from the axioms listed on p. 97 to a measure,
is not formalized, and the tower's own representation theorem uses [scott-1964]'s cancellation
condition rather than those axioms. The book states the threshold ordering twice: strictly on
p. 152, θ_possible < θ_might < θ_likely < θ_must < θ_certain, which `StrictMono` records, and on
p. 156 with θ_possible = θ_might. That the Disjunctive Inference fails on the probability scale,
and that *more likely than* does not entail *might*, are [lassiter-2015]'s
`Lassiter2015.prob_refutes_rightUnion` and `Lassiter2015.weak_refutes_moreLikely_might`.

For chapters 7 and 8, the goodness scale and the alternative sets of the constraint set are
parameters; the consequences take the needed alternative memberships as hypotheses, the polar
sets `{φ, ¬φ}` being the book's weakest choice. The counter-model instantiates the scale by
expected value over an equiprobable domain of four worlds indexed by the truth values of `A` and
`B`.

## TODO

* The measurement-theoretic representation of p. 82 and p. 97, and its generalization to sets of
  measures when connectedness fails.
* The certainty scales of Analyses 2 and 3 (§5.1.6, §5.1.7), the first a half-open interval
  (`Degree.Boundedness.ofOrder_Ioc`) or a log transform.
* The experiment of §6.5 as `Data/Experiments`, and the modifier judgments of §4.2 as examples.
