# Pietraszko (2026): In Defense of the Clause-Internal Phase

This file formalizes the argument of [pietraszko-2026] that VoiceP in Zimbabwean Ndebele is
a phase, from its opacity to A-movement and φ-agreement rather than from footprints of
successive-cyclic movement. A subject may move to Spec,TP and control agreement on T (5), or
stay in situ under default agreement (6); of the three sources of a missing probe–goal
relation (8), the account is locality: T always bears EPP and φ, VoiceP is a phase under the
strong Phase Impenetrability Condition of [chomsky-2000], and Voice bears EPP optionally (9),
(10). A subject that reaches Spec,VoiceP is visible to every head above and, operations being
obligatory when possible with an unchecked EPP tolerated as in [preminger-2014], moves on to
Spec,TP; a subject left in the phase's complement is invisible to them all. Hence movement and
agreement go together (11)–(14) (`simple_clause`); auxiliary constructions agree on every head
or on none and admit no intermediate landing site (16)–(21) (`auxV_uniform`,
`auxV_no_partial`); a reduced clause whose highest head is Asp lets Asp attract the subject on
its own (34)–(42) (`reduced_clause`); a subject that leaves its VoiceP has agreed with T on the
way (25)–(28) (`agrees_of_lt_landing`); and hyperraising yields the four subject positions of
(77) from the EPP of the phase heads alone, the VP-internal one included (69), (76)
(`hyperraising_sites`). The general form is phase-delimited movement (79): movement within a
phase is obligatory (`phase_internal_obligatory`), and a phase head without EPP freezes the
subject below it (`cross_phasal_frozen`). The account with an optional [EPP, φ] on T of
[carstens-mletshe-2015] admits the unattested partial patterns (30), (31) and default
agreement on a T the subject has crossed (25) (`optional_T_overgenerates`), where the phasal
account excludes them.

## Implementation notes

A clause is the list of heads above the subject's base position, bottom-up, each with its
category and whether it bears EPP, a φ-probe, and heads a phase; one bottom-up pass computes
the subject's landing site and the heads it is accessible to: an EPP head attracts an
accessible subject to its specifier and a phase head without EPP freezes it in its complement
(`stateAt`, `landing`, `Accessible`). The rival account is the same derivation with Voice
non-phasal and [EPP, φ] optional on T and Asp. The expletive-pro account of [halpert-2015]
(§3.2), the antifocus account of [zeller-2015] (§4), the modification of [henderson-2006],
object dislocation (55) and the information-structural properties of the two orders are prose;
the substrate's tree-level `Phase.Impenetrable` is the same condition at the level of syntactic
objects.
