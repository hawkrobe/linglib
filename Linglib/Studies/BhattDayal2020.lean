# Bhatt and Dayal 2020: the polar question particle kya:

This file formalizes Bhatt and Dayal's analysis of Hindi-Urdu polar *kya:*. The particle is
not a clause-typing Q-morpheme of the Japanese *-ka* kind: it occurs in polar and
alternative questions but not in constituent questions, and it embeds under rogative
predicates and modified responsives but not under plain responsives — the quasi-subordinated
configuration, which the authors place in a projection above CP, ForceP, that only some
predicates select. Semantically *kya:* is the identity on its sister question, defined only
when that question's alternative set is a singleton; a polar question denotes the singleton
of its nucleus proposition, a constituent question a plural set. An alternative question is
the disjunction of two polar questions and so has two alternatives; *kya:* is licensed in it
by applying inside a disjunct, and fails when it scopes over the disjunction. That failure
rules out one parse of clause-final *kya:* with a disjunction (51); the paper leaves open why
the other parse, with *kya:* on the second disjunct (52), is unavailable.

## Main definitions

* `KyaDefined`: the domain of *kya:*, a sister with a single alternative (23).
* `altQ`: the alternative question *p or q* as the disjunction of two polar questions.
* `selectsForceP`: the embedding contexts whose selecting predicate takes a ForceP
  complement.

## Main results

* `kya_polar`, `kya_not_wh`: the presupposition holds of a polar question and fails on a
  constituent question with two answer cells.
* `altQ_not_kyaDefined`: *kya:* over an alternative question fails.
* `kyaDefined_iff_not_isInquisitive`: in the type-uniform setting the presupposition picks
  out exactly the non-inquisitive contents, declaratives included.
* `kya_licensed_iff_selectsForceP`, `kya_clause_types`: the fragment's embedding and
  clause-type distributions.

## Implementation notes

Questions are inquisitive contents, and the paper's Hamblin set is a content's set of
alternatives `alt`: the polar question `{p}` of (22b) is `ofSet p` and the constituent
question of (22a) is `which`. Inquisitive contents do not separate declaratives from
interrogatives, so the declarative *p* is `ofSet p` as well and meets the presupposition. The
paper keeps *kya:* off declaratives by a type distinction instead, and names highlighting in
the sense of [roelofsen-farkas-2015] as the replacement in theories without one; [xu-2017]
analyses *nandao* that way. `kyaDefined_iff_not_isInquisitive` states the collapse. The
paper's alternative question is the union `{p, q}` of the two disjuncts; the inquisitive
disjunction `altQ p q` has both as alternatives only when neither entails the other, which
the theorems about it assume.
