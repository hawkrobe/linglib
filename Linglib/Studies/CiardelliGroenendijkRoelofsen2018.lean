# [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]: Inquisitive Semantics
[frege-1918] [hintikka-1962] [stalnaker-1978] [hamblin-1973] [karttunen-1977] [groenendijk-stokhof-1984] [puncochar-2019]

Substrate-audit study file for [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]
*Inquisitive Semantics* (OUP, Oxford Surveys in Semantics and
Pragmatics 6). The substrate of `Semantics/Questions/` IS this paper's
formalisation: every CGR Chapter-2 and Chapter-3 definition has a
direct counterpart in `Question`. This file's job is to make the
correspondence explicit, by (a) docstring-mapping each CGR definition
to its substrate identifier and (b) re-proving the key CGR facts on
the substrate so that the substrate is verifiably faithful to CGR.

Unique among `Studies/` files: this is **not** a paper *replication*
(building the paper's machinery from scratch and showing it agrees
with the substrate) — it is a paper *audit* (confirming the substrate
already implements the paper).

## What this file does NOT cover

* **Ch 4** First-order syntax (the `InqB` logical language): the substrate
  is at the meaning side (`Question W`); the syntactic translation
  layer is not formalised here.
* **Ch 6** Disjunction, clause typing, intonation: partial coverage in
  `Semantics/Mood/` and the focus studies (`Studies/Rooth1992.lean`).
* **Ch 7** Conditionals: the substrate exposes `⇨` via the
  `HeytingAlgebra` instance; [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]
  Ch 7's full empirical analysis lives in
  `Semantics/Conditionals/` and study files there.
* **Ch 8** Inquisitive epistemic logic / `know` and `wonder`: see
  `Semantics/Attitudes/` and `Studies/TheilerRoelofsenAloni2018.lean`.
* **Ch 9** Comparison with alternative semantics, partition semantics,
  inquisitive indifference: covered piecemeal in
  `Studies/{Hamblin1973_TODO, GroenendijkStokhof1984}.lean`
  (alt and partition) and `Semantics/Questions/` (as topical
  bridges).

disjuncts under substrate names. -/

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 2.18 (i):
    non-inquisitive iff `info(P) ∈ P`. The substrate's
    `isDeclarative` IS this condition by definition. -/
theorem CGR_2_18_non_inquisitive_iff (P : Question W) :
    ¬ P.isInquisitive ↔ P.isDeclarative :=
  (isDeclarative_iff_not_isInquisitive P).symm

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 2.18 (ii):
    non-informative iff `info(P) = W`. The substrate's `isInformative`
    is "informative content excludes some world", so non-informative is

/-! ### §2.4.2 Fact 2.19 — Non-inquisitive characterizations

[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 2.19 lists four
equivalent characterizations of non-inquisitivity. The substrate has
the `isDeclarative_iff_eq_declarative_info` form (corresponding to
characterization 2 in the chain). The other directions follow. -/

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 2.19 (1↔2):
    non-inquisitive iff `P = ℘(info(P))` (the principal-ideal
    characterization). The substrate-level
    `isDeclarative_iff_eq_declarative_info` IS this. -/
theorem CGR_2_19_eq_declarative_info (P : Question W) :
    P.isDeclarative ↔ P = declarative P.info :=
  isDeclarative_iff_eq_declarative_info P

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 2.19 (4):
    non-inquisitive iff `P` is supported by `s` exactly when `P` is
    true at every world in `s` (truth-conditional support). Direct
    consequence of `truth_iff_singleton_support` + downward closure. -/

/-! ### §2.5 Contexts and update

[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Def 2.35: update is
`C[P] := C ∩ P` — the substrate's lattice meet `⊓`. Fact 2.36: when
both `C` and `P` are non-inquisitive (i.e., declaratives), the update
reduces to the standard intersection on informative content. -/

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Def 2.35: update IS the
    substrate meet operation. Tautology — substrate-`⊓` was defined
    pointwise on `props`. Stated as a theorem to anchor the
    substrate's `inf` to CGR's `[·]` notation. -/
theorem CGR_2_35_update_eq_inf (C P : Question W) :
    (C ⊓ P).props = C.props ∩ P.props := rfl

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 2.36 (Update
    without inquisitiveness reproduces standard results): if both `C`
    and `P` are non-inquisitive, then their update is again
    non-inquisitive, with informative content equal to the standard
    intersection of the inputs' informative contents. -/

/-! ### §3.1.2 Algebraic operations on inquisitive propositions

[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Facts 3.1, 3.2, 3.5 and
the projection-related Facts 3.13–3.15. The substrate already
provides these as `sInf`, `sSup`, `compl_eq`, `proj`, `nonInfo`, and
their respective theorems. The bridge theorems below give the CGR
formulations directly on the substrate's vocabulary. -/

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 3.1 (Meet):
    arbitrary meet has support iff every member supports.
    Substrate-side: `sInfContent` is defined this way; restate to
    expose the CGR membership iff. -/
theorem CGR_3_1_meet (S : Set (Question W)) (s : Set W) :
    s ∈ sInf S ↔ ∀ P ∈ S, s ∈ P := mem_sInf_props

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 3.2 (Join):
    arbitrary join has support iff some member supports (or `s = ∅`).
    The substrate-side `mem_sSup_props` exposes the disjunctive
    structure. The CGR formulation special-cases the empty family to
    `{∅} = ⊥`; the substrate gets this from the `s = ∅` clause. -/
theorem CGR_3_2_join (S : Set (Question W)) (s : Set W) :
    s ∈ sSup S ↔ s = ∅ ∨ ∃ P ∈ S, s ∈ P := mem_sSup_props

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 3.5 (Absolute
    pseudo-complement, alternative characterization): `P* = ℘(¬info(P))`.
    The substrate's `compl_eq` IS this — `Pᶜ = declarative (info P)ᶜ`,
    and `declarative q = ℘(q)` (principal ideal). -/
theorem CGR_3_5_pseudo_complement (P : Question W) :
    Pᶜ = declarative (P.info)ᶜ := compl_eq P

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Def 3.13 (Projection
    operators): `!P := ℘(info(P))` is the substrate's `proj`; `?P` is
    `nonInfo P := P ⊔ Pᶜ`. -/
theorem CGR_3_13_proj_eq (P : Question W) :
    P.proj = declarative P.info := rfl

theorem CGR_3_13_nonInfo_eq (P : Question W) :
    nonInfo P = P ⊔ Pᶜ := nonInfo_eq_sup_compl P

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 3.14 (Division):
    every proposition decomposes uniquely as the meet of its non-inquisitive
    projection and its non-informative projection. Substrate's
    `proj_inf_nonInfo`. -/
theorem CGR_3_14_division (P : Question W) :
    P = P.proj ⊓ nonInfo P :=
  (proj_inf_nonInfo P).symm

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] Fact 3.15 (Projection
    operators in algebraic terms): `!P = P**`. Substrate's
    `proj_eq_compl_compl`. -/
theorem CGR_3_15_proj_eq_compl_compl (P : Question W) :
    P.proj = Pᶜᶜ := proj_eq_compl_compl P

/-! ### §5.1 Polar questions

[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] §5.1: the polar question
`?Mab` (Is Alice married to Bob?) is the inquisitive disjunction of
the proposition `Mab` and its complement. The substrate primitive
`polar` IS this construction. -/

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] §5.1: substrate
    identification of the polar question. The substrate's `polar p`
    expands to `declarative p ⊔ declarative pᶜ`, matching CGR's
    definition `?p := p ∨ ¬p` since on declarative propositions `¬p`
    reduces to `declarative pᶜ`. -/
theorem CGR_5_1_polar_eq (p : Set W) :
    polar p = declarative p ⊔ declarative pᶜ := polar_eq_sup p

/-! ### §5.4 Wh-questions

[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] §5.4.2: the mention-some
wh-question `∃xLax` (What is something Alice likes?) is the
inquisitive disjunction (= Hamblin disjunction) of declaratives
`{|Lad| | d ∈ D}↓`. The substrate primitive `which D P` IS this
construction. -/

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] §5.4.2 substrate
    identification: the mention-some wh-question denotation `∃xLax`
    matches the substrate's `which D L` Hamblin disjunction. The
    `↓` notation in CGR is downward closure, which is automatic in
    the substrate (`Question` is a `LowerSet`). -/
theorem CGR_5_4_2_which_resolution
    {E : Type*} (D : Set E) (P : E → Set W) (s : Set W) :
    s ∈ which D P ↔ s = ∅ ∨ ∃ e ∈ D, s ⊆ P e := mem_which

/-! ### §5.5 Question coordination

[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] §5.5: question conjunction
and disjunction are uniformly the lattice meet and join, exactly as
they are for declaratives. The substrate's `⊓`/`⊔` IS this. The
identification is automatic — there's no separate "question conjunction"
operator. -/

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] §5.5.1: question
    conjunction reduces to substrate `⊓`. The CGR claim is that the
    InqB translation of "Q and Q'" is `μ ∧ μ'` — same operator as for
    declaratives. The substrate's `Question.conj = ⊓` IS this. -/
theorem CGR_5_5_1_conj_eq_inf (Q Q' : Question W) :
    Q ⊓ Q' = conj Q Q' := inf_eq_conj Q Q'

/-- [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018] §5.5.2: question
    disjunction reduces to substrate `⊔`. -/
theorem CGR_5_5_2_disj_eq_sup (Q Q' : Question W) :
    Q ⊔ Q' = inqDisj Q Q' := sup_eq_inqDisj Q Q'

/-! ### Closing observation

The substrate-side coverage of [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]
Chapters 2, 3, and 5 is essentially complete: every CGR primitive has
a direct substrate counterpart with matching semantics. The only
non-trivial added structure on the substrate side is the
`SetLike (Question W) (Set W)` instance and the
`CompleteDistribLattice` registration — both of which are mathlib-style
ergonomic upgrades that don't change the underlying mathematics.

This audit is **load-bearing**: it documents that the substrate's
`Question W = LowerSet (Set W)` design is the [ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2018]
inquisitive proposition, with the same algebraic and order-theoretic
structure. Future substrate refactors should preserve these
identifications. -/
