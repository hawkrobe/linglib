# Pasternak (2019): A Lot of Hatred and a Ton of Desire

Pasternak analyzes intensity as a monotonic measure function on mental states. *Ann hates Bill more
than Matt hates Jeff* is a verbal comparative of the same shape as Wellwood's *more snow* and *ran
more*: the comparative maximizes the intensity measure over the verb's eventualities with the given
experiencers and themes, and presupposes, as Schwarzschild's monotonicity requires of every such
construction, that the measure is monotonic on the salient part-whole relation among the verb's
states. The comparative entails the matrix positive but not the than-clause positive, which a zero
degree in the than-clause set secures, and under the presupposition it compares the maximal states.
Mental-state predicates are homogeneous, a state of Ann hating Bill having only such states as
parts.

## Main definitions

* `intensityComparative`: the intensity comparative.
* `Monotonic`: the monotonicity presupposition.
* `intensityComparativeZero`: the comparative with a zero degree in the than-clause set.

## Main results

* `intensityComparative_of_greatest`: under the presupposition the comparative compares the maximal
  states.
* `intensityComparativeZero_of_none`: the than-clause positive is not entailed.
* `div_iff`: mental-state homogeneity.

## Implementation notes

The reduction of a comparative to its greatest witnesses under a monotone measure is
`Degree.maxComparative_of_isGreatest`; the zero-degree amendment to the than-clause set is the
paper's own (`thanDegreesZero`); the part-whole order on eventualities is a partial order on the
event domain. The two-dimensional state ontology that grounds the salient part-whole relation, the
Mandarin data, and the desire predicates are not formalized.

## TODO

* Mandarin *duō* / *hěn duō (de)*, which needs Fragment entries.
* The two-dimensional state ontology with its vertical axis and the fineness ordering.
* The desire predicates *want*, *wish*, and *regret* over point-states.
