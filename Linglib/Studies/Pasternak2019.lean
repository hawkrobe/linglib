# [pasternak-2019]: Intensity in the Mereology of Mental States

[pasternak-2019]

Pasternak argues that intensity is a **monotonic measure function** on
mental states: a more intense psychological state is "bigger" along a
vertical part-whole dimension. This gives a uniform compositional
treatment of intensity comparatives (`Ann hates Bill more than Matt
hates Jeff`) under the same architecture as `more snow` and `ran more`:
all are Wellwood-style verbal comparatives with a measure function `μ`
satisfying the Schwarzschild Monotonicity Constraint (Pasternak (4)).

The substrate already hosts every primitive Pasternak's §1–§4 needs:
- Monotonicity = `Semantics.Gradability.StatesBased.admissibleMeasure`
  (`StrictMono` over a preorder; multi-tradition naming credits
  Schwarzschild, Wellwood, Krifka, CSW, Pasternak, LaBToM in one
  docstring).
- Comparative LF = `Wellwood2015.IsMaxDeg` over a than-clause degree
  set, with the `comparativeTruth_max` reduction lemma.
- Mental-state homogeneity = `Mereology.DIV` (downward-closure on the
  part-whole preorder; Pasternak (55) is the biconditional form, which
  reduces to `DIV` modulo preorder reflexivity).
- Neo-Davidsonian roles = `Semantics.ArgumentStructure.ThematicFrame`
  with `experiencer`, `theme`, `holder` fields.

This study file *consumes* those primitives and adds the paper-specific
content: the five-construction enumeration (§2), the LGH-shaped lexical
entry (§3), the intensity comparative LF allowing distinct themes per
side (§4), the (60)–(63) positive/non-entailment asymmetry (§4.4), and
the bridge connecting CSW's confidence ordering to Pasternak's
mental-state preorder (§6).

## Coverage

| —         | Bridge: CSW's `ConfidenceState` preorder hosts Pasternak's `μ_int`         |

LGH terminological note (Pasternak p.279, p.285): Pasternak introduces
the "lexical gradability hypothesis" (LGH) as a *counterproposal* to his
monotonic account, not as his preferred analysis. He shows it is
*compatible* with monotonicity (eq. (48b) is the LGH-shaped entry) but
prefers the non-LGH form (48a) for English, with `MUCH` introducing the
degree argument. The `MentalStateVerb` structure here adopts the LGH
*shape* (eq. (27)) for convenience as a working lexical entry; the
non-LGH route is equally compatible and the substrate is agnostic
between them.

## Out of scope (corrected substrate-availability claims)

The first-pass version of this file claimed several substrate gaps that
do not exist. Corrected:

- §4.2 two-dimensional ontology: a vertical-altitude axis would *extend*
  `Event.Mereology` (which already provides the
  `Preorder (Event Time)` instance Pasternak's part-whole relation
  consumes). Not a substrate gap; a refinement.
- §5 `want`/`wish`/`regret`: `Semantics/Attitudes/Desire.lean`
  already provides `wantVF` (von Fintel-style) and
  `worldSatisfactionOrdering`. The Pasternak §5 integration is a
  composition with the new `MentalStateHomogeneity` discipline, not
  fresh substrate.
- DOG (eq. 87): `Core.Order.PullbackPreorder.coarsen_via_monotone`
  provides the lattice operation Pasternak's fineness ordering needs.
- Mandarin `duo`/`hen duo (de)` (§3.2): requires Fragment entries in
  `Fragments/Mandarin/`; substrate side carries through unchanged.

/-! ## §1. Monotonicity (Pasternak (4))

Pasternak's def 4 (PDF p.272): `μ` is monotonic on `⊑^c` in `A` iff for
all `x, y ∈ A`, `x ⊏^c y` entails `μ(x) < μ(y)`.

The substrate's `StatesBased.admissibleMeasure` is `StrictMono` over a
preorder — exactly Pasternak's def with `⊑^c` realized as the ambient
`[Preorder S]` instance and the domain `A` implicit in the carrier
type. The substrate's docstring credits all six traditions
(Schwarzschild, Wellwood, Krifka, CSW, Pasternak, LaBToM); no
file-local alias is needed. -/

/-! ## §2. Five Monotonicity-Requiring Constructions (Pasternak §2)

Pasternak §2 enumerates five English measurement constructions, each
imposing a monotonicity requirement on its measure function:

| Construction                  | Pasternak ex. | PDF | Example                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------|-----|-------------------------------|
| Pseudopartitive               | (5)           | 272 | `twelve ounces of gold`       |
| `out the wazoo` / `in spades` | (10)–(11)     | 274 | `water out the wazoo`         |
| Adverbial measure phrase      | (12)          | 275 | `Mara swam a lot`             |
| Nominal comparative           | (15)          | 276 | `more snow than Williamstown` |
| Verbal comparative            | (1)           | 268 | `Dee ran more than Evan did`  |

Pasternak's §3 uses this enumeration to argue that intensity is also
monotonic: intensity comparatives appear in *all five* constructions
and pattern with the monotonic readings. -/

/-! ## §3. Mental State Verbs (Pasternak (27), (48b))

Pasternak's (27) (PDF p.278): `⟦hate⟧_deg = λx.λd.λe. hate(e) ∧ Thm(e, x)
∧ μ_int(e) ≥ d`. The verb's denotation includes the intensity measure
`μ_int` and a degree threshold. Theta-role assignment (`Thm`, `Exp`)
is supplied by a `ThematicFrame` at use sites (Pasternak follows
[kratzer-1996] severance: Voice/v introduces the experiencer,
not the verb).
-/

/-- A mental state verb on the LGH shape (Pasternak (27)). The verb
    contributes its lexical predicate and intensity measure; theme and
    experiencer roles come from a `ThematicFrame` at use sites. -/

  /-- The verb's lexical predicate on eventualities (e.g., `hate`, `love`) -/

  /-- Intensity measure function — Pasternak's `μ_int` -/
  μint : Event Time → ℚ

/-- Pasternak (27)/(48b): "α V x at degree d" — eventuality is in the
    verb's denotation, has experiencer α and theme x via the frame, and
    intensity at or above d. -/

    (v : MentalStateVerb Time) (frame : ThematicFrame Entity Time)
    (α x : Entity) (d : ℚ) (e : Event Time) : Prop :=
  v.predicate e ∧ frame.experiencer α e ∧ frame.theme x e ∧ v.μint e ≥ d

/-! ## §4. Intensity Comparative (Pasternak (53))

Pasternak (53) (PDF p.287) for `Ann hates Bill more than Matt hates Jeff`:

> ASSERTION: ∃e[Exp(e, ann) ∧ hate(e) ∧ Thm(e, bill) ∧ μ_int(e) >
>            max{d | ∃e'[Exp(e', matt) ∧ hate(e') ∧ Thm(e', jeff) ∧
>                         μ_int(e') ≥ d}]

Matrix and than-clause use the same verb (`hate`) but different themes
(`bill` vs `jeff`). Adjectival comparatives like `taller than` use the
same predicate on both sides; intensity comparatives don't. The
substrate's `Wellwood2015.comparativeTruthHetero` (newly added)
generalizes the comparative to allow distinct matrix/than predicates;
Pasternak's intensity case is one specialization. -/

/-- The themed predicate `fun e => v.predicate e ∧ frame.theme x e`:
    eventualities of verb `v` with theme `x`. Used to specialize
    Wellwood's `comparativeTruthHetero` for Pasternak's intensity case. -/

/-- The intensity comparative `α V x more than β V y` (Pasternak (53)):
    a specialization of `Wellwood2015.comparativeTruthHetero` with
    `role = frame.experiencer`, hetero matrix/than predicates differing
    in theme assignment, `extract = id` (states are measured directly),
    and `μ = v.μint`. The substrate's `IsMaxDeg`-based than-clause
    quantification handles the empty-than-clause case via Pasternak (62)
    structurally — no zero-degree disjunct needed at this level (see
    §4.1 below for the non-entailment witness). -/

/-! ### §4.1 Positive entailment asymmetry (Pasternak (60)–(63))

Pasternak's §4.4 prediction (PDF p.292–293): the comparative entails
the matrix positive form (there *is* a witness α-eventuality), but does
**not** entail the than-clause positive form. The non-entailment is
demonstrated by sentences like:

> Jack admires the chairman more than Jill does. In fact, Jill doesn't
> admire him at all. (Pasternak (63a))

To make the non-entailment derivable, Pasternak (62) (PDF p.293)
revises the than-clause to include a zero-degree disjunct, so the
`max` is well-defined even when no β-eventuality exists. This
augmentation is paper-specific (adjectival comparatives in
`Wellwood2015` don't need it); we expose it as a sister definition
`intensityComparativeAug62` and consume it in the non-entailment
theorem. -/

/-- Matrix entailment (Pasternak (60), PDF p.292): the comparative
    entails there is an α-eventuality of the verb with theme `x`.

    and the empty than-clause's max is `0`.

/-! ## §5.1 Intensity Comparative Max-Reduction

The Pasternak analog of `Wellwood2015.adjectival_max_reduces`: under
unique-witness assumptions on both sides, the intensity comparative
reduces to direct measure comparison. Pasternak fn 25 (PDF p.298)
explicitly rejects the unique-state assumption, so this reduction is a
*working simplification*, not Pasternak's official semantics — useful
when the type-level `comparativeTruthHetero` quantification adds noise. -/

/-- Pasternak's intensity comparative reduces to direct measure
    comparison `v.μint eb < v.μint ea` when both sides have unique

/-! ## §6. Bridge to Event Mereology + CSW

`MentalStateHomogeneity` is `Mereology.DIV` over the ambient `[Preorder Event]`.
When `Event = Event Time` and the preorder comes from
`Semantics/Events/Basic.lean::Event.Mereology`, Pasternak's claim
becomes: vP-predicates respect the event-mereology part-of. We expose
two substrate consequences below: a downward-closure inheritance lemma
for sort-determined predicates (using `Event.Mereology.sort_preserved`),
and a g-homogeneity bridge to `Core/Order/Mereology.lean::gHomogeneous`
(triggered when the carrier is a `PartialOrder`).

CSW [cariani-santorio-wellwood-2024] share Pasternak's monotonicity
discipline: their eq. (21) is the same `StrictMono` constraint exposed
as `StatesBased.admissibleMeasure` (multi-tradition naming there). The
architectural mismatch with Pasternak is theme typing — Pasternak's
`Thm : Entity → Event → Prop` is entity-themed (§4 transitive psych
verbs); CSW's `theme : W → Prop` is propositional (gradable attitude
adjectives like `confident that p`). The substrate-level identification
(monotonicity = admissibleMeasure) is now in the `admissibleMeasure`
docstring, not as a redundant per-file Iff.rfl. -/

/-- Sort-determined predicates inherit homogeneity from
    `Event.Mereology.sort_preserved`: any predicate of the form
    "eventuality has sort `s`" is downward-closed under part-of, so
    `MentalStateHomogeneity` follows for free. Pasternak's mental-state
    predicates are stative (Levin class 31.2; Vendler `state`); to the
    extent they implicate sort, they inherit homogeneity from this
    theorem. -/

    (Event.Mereology.sort_preserved e' e hle).trans hPe

/-- On a `PartialOrder` carrier, Pasternak's `MentalStateHomogeneity`
    implies `Mereology.gHomogeneous` (every proper part has a P-part —
    itself, by reflexivity). Direct application of the substrate's
    `Mereology.div_implies_gHomogeneous` since `MentalStateHomogeneity`
    is definitionally `Mereology.DIV`. -/

    (h : MentalStateHomogeneity P) : Mereology.gHomogeneous P :=

/-! ## §6.1 Fragment Integration: English Psych Verbs

Pasternak's intensity framework predicts that *experiencer-subject psych
verbs* (Levin class 31.2 "admire") are gradable in intensity and pattern
with monotonic measurement constructions. The English Fragment
(`Fragments/English/Predicates/Verbal.lean`) classifies seven such
verbs: `like`, `love`, `hate`, `admire`, `respect`, `fear` (NP form),
`dread` (NP form). All seven carry `vendlerClass := some .state` and
`levinClass := some .admire` — consistent with Pasternak's prediction.

The agreement theorem below makes the Fragment-substrate consistency
audit-visible: any change to either the Fragment's classification of
these verbs or the Pasternak-side claim that state-class admire-class
verbs are gradable in intensity will surface as a type error or
broken proof. -/

/-! ## §7. Future Work

Three Pasternak topics this file does not formalize:

### §3.2 Mandarin `duo` / `hen duo (de)`

Pasternak §3.2 argues from Mandarin morphology that intensity
comparatives pattern with monotonic constructions even when `duo`
('much') is overtly required. Substrate side (monotonicity discipline)
carries through unchanged; the per-construction Mandarin Fragment is
the missing piece. `Fragments/Mandarin/` exists but lacks `duo`/`hen`/`de`
entries with measure-function payloads.

### §4.2 Two-dimensional state ontology + DOG (eq. 87)

Pasternak's vertical altitude axis `K` (PDF p.288) extends rather than
replaces the substrate's `Event.Mereology Time` preorder. A
`Semantics/Events/VerticalDimension.lean` add-on with
`κ : Event Time → Set Altitude` plus the DOG fineness lattice (which can
consume `Core.Order.PullbackPreorder.coarsen_via_monotone`) is a clean
follow-up. Out of scope here because it is not load-bearing for §1–§6.

### §5 `want` / `wish` / `regret` semantics

Pasternak §5 integrates Hintikkan world-quantification into the two-
dimensional ontology via point-states (eq. 67), `WANT_vF` (eq. 73,
[von-fintel-1999]), `WANT_H` (eq. 91, [heim-1992]), and DOG.
The substrate has `Attitudes.Desire.wantVF` and
`Attitudes.Desire.worldAtLeastAsGood` already; the Pasternak §5
integration is a composition with `MentalStateHomogeneity`, not new
substrate. A follow-on `Pasternak2019Attitudes.lean` (or extension of
this file) is the natural next paper-level deepening, alongside
Phillips-Brown 2018 (Sinn und Bedeutung) on graded want — also not in
linglib bib yet.

The chronologically-later [phillips-brown-2025] formalization
(`Studies/PhillipsBrown2025.lean`) builds on the same
`Attitudes.Desire` substrate, generalizing `wantVF` to question-based
`wantQuestionBased`. That study file's §11 makes the disagreement with
[condoravdi-lauer-2016] explicit; the analogous Pasternak vs
question-based contrast (intensity-based vs question-based resolution
of conflicting desires) is left as future work.

The chronologically-later [lassiter-2017] formalization
(`Studies/Lassiter2017.lean`) sits structurally
adjacent to Pasternak: both are gradable-`want` accounts (Pasternak
intensity, Lassiter expected value) using ℚ-valued degree functions.
The substrate overlap is `Attitudes.Desire.Lassiter.expectedValue` vs
Pasternak's mereological `intensityComparative`; both are
`Set.entails`-style `μ(p) > μ(q)` predicates over different scales.
A `pasternak_lassiter_intensity_vs_EV` bridge theorem comparing
predictions on a shared mental-state model is the natural next step,
also future work.
