# Kratzer (2012): Modals and Conditionals

This file formalizes the distinction the book's second chapter draws, in its typology of
conversational backgrounds, between realistic backgrounds representing evidence of things and
informational backgrounds representing the propositional content of a source of information.
A rumor that Roger was elected chief can feed either. As evidence of things it determines the
worlds that contain a counterpart of the rumor, produced the same way; whether Roger's
counterpart was elected there depends on how reliable the source is, so *given the rumor,
Roger must have been elected chief* is false when the rumor rests on shaky evidence and true
only when the source is reliable. As a source of information it determines the worlds
compatible with what it says, so the German reportative *sollen* in *dem Gerücht nach soll
Roger zum Häuptling gewählt worden sein* is true whatever the rumor's provenance, even a lie.
The informational background is therefore not realistic, since the actual world need not be
among the worlds the rumor describes.

The chapter's revised comparative possibility (§2.4) compares two propositions only on the worlds
where they differ. Along a ranking of worlds without ties, the probability measures that preserve
it are exactly those in which each world outweighs all worse worlds together, and Kratzer's toy
measure, giving the world `wᵢ` the probability `2ⁱ/15`, is one of them. Once two worlds are
unranked and a third is not above them, no measure giving that third world weight preserves it, as
the chapter observes for ties. Under the Limit Assumption a ranking without ties has a single best
world, so necessity and possibility collapse (§2.5). With a tie they come apart. The necessary
propositions are then those necessary however the tie is resolved, a supervaluation that Stalnaker
proposed for counterfactuals, and the merely possible ones are those holding at exactly one of the
tied best worlds.

## Implementation notes

The worlds record whether Roger was elected and whether the rumor exists, so every claim is
decided over `Bool × Bool`. The evidence-of-things background at a world lists the status of
the rumor there; the informational background lists the rumor's content. Reliability is stated
generally, as a proposition of the background entailing the content wherever the rumor
exists, rather than as an extra coordinate. Counterparts are identified with the rumor's
status, since the model has no other individuals.

The toy examples' worlds are `Fin 4`, the index of `wᵢ` being `i`, and all of them are
accessible, so comparative possibility is `KratzerLift` of the induced ordering with no modal
base to restrict it. The chapter states the rankings `O₁` and `O₂` of §2.5 directly; here they are
induced by nested ordering sources, and `O₁` is the ranking of §2.4. The general results of
§2.4–§2.5 are Kratzer's question and caveats answered for these operators rather than theorems the
chapter proves.

/-! ### Grades of possibility (§2.4–§2.5)

Comparative possibility on a ranking of worlds is the revised lift `KratzerLift`, which compares
two propositions only on the worlds where they differ. Along a ranking without ties, the
probability measures that preserve it are those in which each world outweighs all worse worlds
together, and once two worlds are unranked with a third not above them, no measure giving that
third world weight preserves it. Under the Limit Assumption a ranking without ties has a single
best world, so necessity and possibility coincide. The toy examples of §2.4 and §2.5 are
instances on four worlds. -/
