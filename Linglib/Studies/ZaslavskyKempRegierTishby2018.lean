# Zaslavsky, Kemp, Regier and Tishby (2018): Efficient Compression in Color Naming

This file formalizes the communication model of [zaslavsky-kemp-regier-tishby-2018], in which
a color naming system is an encoder that compresses meanings, distributions over the colors of
the environment, into words, and languages are hypothesized to trade off the complexity of the
lexicon against the accuracy of communication as the Information Bottleneck principle of
[tishby-pereira-bialek-1999] prescribes. The meanings are a Markov kernel from `M` to the
environment `U`, the cognitive source a probability measure on `M`, and the encoder a Markov
kernel from `M` to the words `W`. The listener is the Bayesian decoder, interpreting a word as
the posterior mixture of meanings (`decoder`), and no other decoder has lower expected
distortion (`distortion_le`). Complexity is the information the words carry about the meanings
(`complexity`), accuracy the information they carry about the environment (`accuracy`), and the
expected Kullback–Leibler distortion between the speaker's meaning and the listener's
interpretation is the information about the environment that the lexicon loses
(`distortion_eq`), so that minimizing distortion is maximizing accuracy. Accuracy is bounded by
complexity and by the information the meanings carry (`accuracy_le_complexity`,
`accuracy_le_sourceInfo`), and a lexicon that ignores the meaning has complexity `0`
(`complexity_const`).

The Information Bottleneck objective `F_β = I(M;W) − β I(W;U)` (`objective`) is, up to a
constant, the β-scalarized cost of `Pragmatics.Efficiency` on the pair of distortion and
complexity (`objective_eq_weightedCost`), and a language's deviation from optimality at `β` is
the substrate's `efficiencyLossAt` (`deviation_eq_efficiencyLossAt`). Below `β = 1` the
meaning-blind lexicon is optimal (`objective_const_le`). Every minimizer of `F_β` has the
self-consistent Boltzmann form in which a word's probability decays exponentially in its
divergence from the meaning (`ibUpdate`, `IsIBOptimum`, `isIBOptimum_of_forall_objective_le`), so
that at finite `β` the optimal categories are soft (`IsIBOptimum.real_pos`).

The cognitive source is the least informative source of the SI (§2). A least informative prior
of a naming distribution maximizes the entropy of the meaning less its conditional entropy given
the word (`IsLeastInformative`, eq. S10); that objective is the complexity of the lexicon
(`measureEntropy_sub_condEntropy`, eq. S11), so the least informative priors are the
capacity-achieving priors (`isLeastInformative_iff`) and, with positive mass everywhere, the
fixed points of the Blahut–Arimoto update of [blahut-1972] and [arimoto-1972]
(`IsLeastInformative.eq_blahutArimoto`). The complexity is also the word average of the
divergence of the posterior from the prior (`complexity_eq_sum_klDiv_posterior`, eq. S12), and the
universal source averages the least informative priors of the languages (`averagePrior`,
eq. S13).

## Implementation notes

* The information quantities are the mutual informations `Im[·]` of `InformationTheory`, and
  the distortion the divergences `klDiv` of mathlib; the paper's forms with the word marginal in
  the denominator are the averaged divergences of `InformationTheory.measureMutualInfo_compProd`
  (`complexity_eq`). On finite alphabets no positivity assumption is needed: a meaning and a word
  that co-occur make the meaning absolutely continuous with respect to the word's
  interpretation.
* `distortion_eq` and `distortion_le` are the compensation identity
  `InformationTheory.sum_mul_toReal_klDiv` for the meanings channel, applied at each word's
  posterior over meanings.
* Eq. 7 is a fixed-point equation: the Boltzmann encoder `ibUpdate` tilts the word marginal row
  by row (`Measure.tilted`), and `isIBOptimum_of_forall_objective_le` is the Gibbs variational
  principle of `Core.Probability.GibbsVariational` applied to each row. `F_β + β I(M;U)` is the
  source average of the negative free energies of the encoder's rows against its own word
  marginal and Bayesian decoder, and at most that average against any other; each row's free
  energy is at most its log partition function, with equality only at the tilt
  (`eq_tilted_of_freeEnergy_eq_cgf`). The theorem assumes a source and meanings of full
  support, as the paper's Gaussian meanings are.
* The efficiency loss `ε_l` divides the minimal deviation by the fitted `β_l`; the fit itself is
  a numerical optimization outside the formalization. The empirical encoders of the World Color
  Survey are not in the library.
