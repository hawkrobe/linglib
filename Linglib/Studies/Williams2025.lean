# Williams (2025): the presuppositions of *forget*

Williams accounts for when the complement of *forget* carries a covert modal. *Forget* is factive
whatever its complement, after the Kiparskys, and with a plain infinitive the presupposed
proposition is modal: *John forgot to stop by the flower shop* presupposes that John was supposed
to. White puts the modal in every nonfinite complement, but a PRO-ing gerund and a Spanish perfect
infinitive, both nonfinite, presuppose the event and not an obligation, so the modal heads plain
infinitives only. The modal is a last resort for Bondarenko's pre-existence presupposition, that the
embedded event started before the forgetting: an anterior complement meets it as soon as the
complement holds, while a plain infinitive contradicts it and needs the modal.

## Main definitions

* `aspP`: the plain infinitive.
* `anterior`: the anterior shift of the gerund and the perfect.
* `mod`: the plan modal.
* `PreEx`: pre-existence at the forgetting.
* `NeedsMod`: the need for the modal.

## Main results

* `needsMod_aspP`: a plain infinitive needs the modal.
* `not_needsMod_anterior_aspP`: the anterior complements do not.
* `preEx_mod_iff`: the presupposition under the modal.
* `mca_overgenerates`: White's Modalized Complement Analysis overgenerates.

## Implementation notes

* The paper's complements are Champollion's continuations, from a predicate of events to a
  proposition at a time (28). Each one the paper builds closes a predicate of events against the
  continuation, and the only continuations applied are the trivial one of Krifka's closure (27) and
  equality with the embedded event in (28b), so a complement here is the predicate of events itself
  (`Complement`), and closure binds its event (`Complement.closure`).
* mathlib orders intervals by inclusion: the paper's `τ(e) ⊆ t` is `(τ e) ≤ t`, its `t' < t` in
  (30a) and (30b) is `t'.precedes t`, the `t ≤ t'` of (37) is `t.isBefore t'`, and `LB` is `.fst`.
* Pre-existence is `Event.PreExists` of `Semantics/Events/PreExistence.lean`, shared with
  `Studies/Bondarenko2020`. (28b) as printed binds the complement's time existentially, and so bound
  it cannot tell the plain infinitive from the anterior complements (`exists_anterior_iff`). The
  derivations (32), (34) and (36) evaluate the complement at the attitude holder's subjective now,
  which `PreEx` takes to be the run time of the forgetting.
* (30a) and (30b) are printed as one formula, so (32) and (34) are one theorem. The paper implements
  the perfect after Kratzer, and (30b) prints it as strict precedence, not the
  `ViewpointType.perfect` relation, whose intervals may touch.
* (40)(i) and (40)(ii) are assumptions about the plan state, not consequences of (37), and the
  proper inclusion of the subjective now in the plan's run time in (40)(ii) does not by itself start
  the plan earlier; the prose does ("the runtime of Mod begins before this"). The plan state's
  starting earlier is a hypothesis of `not_needsMod_mod`. A state with no plan worlds satisfies (37)
  vacuously.
* Plain infinitives are simultaneous with the matrix reference time, after Wurmbrand, which places
  AspP at the subjective now in (36).
* The assertion of (28a), that the attitude holder does not believe the complement, plays no part in
  the argument and is not formalized; neither is the necessity and sufficiency presupposition (5b),
  which the paper leaves to future work, nor the implicative entailment of *forgot to*, after
  Karttunen, which it sets aside (fn. 1).
* The English fragment has an implicative *forget* taking an infinitive and a factive one taking a
  finite clause or a gerund, `English.Verbs.forget` and `English.Verbs.forget_rog`; Williams'
  uniformity hypothesis takes them to be one verb. `mca_overgenerates` reads their frames.

theorem precedes_of_anterior_aspP (h : anterior (aspP P) w t e) : (τ e).precedes t :=
  let ⟨_, ht, hle, _⟩ := h

/-- For the gerund and the perfect infinitive, pre-existence is the complement's holding at the
forgetting, (32), (34). -/

/-- A plain infinitive needs the modal, (15a). -/
theorem needsMod_aspP (P : W → E → Prop) : NeedsMod (aspP P) :=

    ¬ NeedsMod (mod plan C) :=

/-! ### Against the Modalized Complement Analysis, §3.1 -/

/-- [white-2014] modalizes the infinitive of the implicative *forget* and the gerund of the
factive one alike, but the infinitive frame hosts the plain infinitive, which needs the modal,
and the perfect infinitive, which like the gerund does not: whether the modal heads a complement
is not a matter of its frame. -/

/-! ### The *began* tests, (19) and (21)

Days are integers, Monday `1`, Tuesday `2`, Wednesday `3`, and Mary forgets on Tuesday. -/

/-- A call begun on Monday is one Mary can have forgotten calling back, (19a). -/
example : PreEx (anterior (aspP fun (_ : Unit) e ↦ e = (.pure 1 : NonemptyInterval ℤ)))
    (.pure 2) () :=
  preEx_anterior_aspP_iff.2 ⟨_, .pure 1, by decide, le_rfl, rfl⟩

/-- A call begun on Wednesday is not, (19b). -/
example : ¬ PreEx (anterior (aspP fun (_ : Unit) e ↦ e = (.pure 3 : NonemptyInterval ℤ)))
    (.pure 2) () := by
  rintro ⟨_, ⟨_, -, -, rfl⟩, h⟩
  exact absurd h (by decide)

/-- In (21a) Mary forgot to call back her twin, as told on Monday, and in the plan world `true` she
calls on Wednesday. -/
example : PreEx (mod (fun _ _ _ ↦ {true})
      (aspP fun w e ↦ w = true ∧ e = (.pure 3 : NonemptyInterval ℤ))) (.pure 2) false :=
  ⟨.pure 1, fun _ hw ↦ ⟨.pure 3, by decide, _, le_rfl, hw, rfl⟩, by decide⟩
