# Bybee 1985: relevance and lexical strength

A morpheme category whose meaning is more relevant to the verb stem should be expressed
inflectionally in more languages, sit closer to the stem where it is, and fuse with it more
tightly. This file formalizes the evidence for the first two, from a fifty-language stratified
sample: the frequency surveys of chapter 2 and the morpheme-order counts of the same chapter, in
which every tested pair confirms the predicted direction and aspect against tense and against mood
does so without a single counterexample.

The order those counts determine is then shown to be the substrate's relevance order rather than a
table chosen to match it: on the four categories the survey covers, the relation derived from the
counts and the substrate's `RelevanceLT` are the same order. Fusion, the third claim, is
qualitative in the source.

Chapter 5's notion of lexical strength closes the file: an irregular verb keeps its irregularity
where its token frequency is high, and the Strong Verbs that regularized are the infrequent ones.

## Main definitions

* `BybeeCategory` — the verbal-inflectional categories of Ch 2, in relevance order.
* `inflectionalCount50`, `derivOrInflCount50` — the Ch 2 §5 frequency surveys (Figs 1+2).
* `orderPairs` — the Ch 2 §6 morpheme-order counts, one `OrderPair` per tested category pair.
* `toMorphCategory` — the embedding of `BybeeCategory` into the substrate `MorphCategory`.
* `SurveyedCloser` — the stem-proximity order *derived from* `orderPairs`.
* `strongStillStrong`, `strongRegularized` — the Ch 5 §6 strong-verb frequency table.

## Main results

* `valence_highest_when_derivOrInfl`, `valence_lowest_when_inflectional` — the
  relevance and generality frequency predictions.
* `predicted_outnumbers_counter`, `aspect_categorical_against_tense_and_mood` — the order
  predictions.
* `survey_order_iso_relevance` — on the surveyed categories `SurveyedCloser` and the substrate
  `RelevanceLT` coincide via `toMorphCategory`: the hierarchy is the order the §6 survey forces,
  not a stipulated table.
* `bybeeSurveyedOrder_respects_hierarchy` — closes the loop to `RespectsRelevanceHierarchy`.
* `strong_verbs_higher_frequency_than_regularized` — the Ch 5 §6 diachronic
  claim: still-Strong verbs have a strictly higher mean token frequency than
  the regularized ones.

/-! ### Morpheme order (Ch 2 §6)

Prediction (b): the most relevant categories sit closest to the stem, the least
relevant furthest. Bybee tests the four most frequent — aspect, tense, mood,
person — counting, per pair, how many languages place one closer than the other.
A language with both categories is untestable when the morphemes are
portmanteau, on opposite sides of the stem (unless only one is stem-adjacent),
or mutually exclusive in one slot; a morpheme expressed by stem modification
counts as closer than one expressed by affixation. -/

/-! ### Connection to substrate `MorphCategory.peripherality`

`MorphCategory.peripherality` (in `Morphology/RelevanceHierarchy.lean`) numerically
encodes the hierarchy — lower = closer to stem = more relevant — faithfully to
Ch 2 §3 for the six core categories. Its extensions (`derivation`, `degree`,
`negation`, `nonfinite`) are linglib additions, not Bybee's. -/

/-- Embed `BybeeCategory` into the substrate `MorphCategory`. All four agreement
subtypes collapse to `.agreement`: Bybee's verbal-number agreement sits at the
low-relevance (rank-8) end with person and gender, *not* with nominal `.number`
(rank 3). Subject vs object is preserved via the controller role. -/

/-! ### Grounding the hierarchy in the survey

On the four categories Bybee surveyed (aspect, tense, mood, person), the
substrate order is not a free choice: `SurveyedCloser`, derived from
`orderPairs`, coincides with `RelevanceLT` via `toMorphCategory`
(`survey_order_iso_relevance`). So a `RespectsRelevanceHierarchy` check over
these categories rests on an order isomorphism, not a stipulated table. -/

/-- `a` is *surveyed closer to the stem than* `b` when some tested Ch 2 §6 pair
predicts `a` closer than `b` and the language counts confirm that direction
(predicted majority). Derived from `orderPairs`, not stipulated. -/

  ∃ p ∈ orderPairs, p.closer = a ∧ p.further = b ∧ p.furtherCount < p.closerCount

/-! ### Lexical strength

Chapter 5 replaces the question whether an item is in the lexicon with two gradient notions. Each
token of use strengthens an item's representation — "etching it with deeper and darker lines each
time" — and strength declines with disuse; and items bear semantic and phonological connections to
one another, a parallel pair of which constitutes a morphological relation. The consequence tested
below is diachronic: an irregular verb survives as irregular where its lexical strength is high.

The table on p. 120 lists the modern descendants of the Class I, II and VII Strong Verbs of
[sweet-1882]'s *Anglo-Saxon Primer* with their all-forms token frequencies; *slit* and *beat* now
take the zero allomorph of the past tense. -/
