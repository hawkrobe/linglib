# Bhadra (2024): Verb roots encode outcomes

This file formalizes Bhadra's account of the reversative prefix *un-* and the restitutive prefix
*re-*. Every dynamic transitive root lexically carries a set of outcomes, the states its object can
be in at the right boundary of the event, while a contextual set of thresholds collects the states
an object can be in at the left boundary. Potential-for-change roots such as *fold*, *wrap* and
*coil* have several outcomes, change-of-state and impingement-effecting roots such as *break*,
*shatter* and *hit* have a single lexically specified outcome, and roots unspecified for change have
none. *Un-* presupposes a prior base event whose result the object is still in and several
outcomes, and asserts that the object returns to the base event's initial state. *Re-* presupposes
a prior base event with the same result and requires that the base action not leave the object
where that result cannot be restored. Cardinality thus governs *un-* alone and threshold structure
governs *re-*, so the two prefixes overlap exactly on the potential-for-change class.

The hierarchy of outcome sets cross-classifies Beavers's affectedness hierarchy. Beavers places the
impingement-effecting verbs with the potential-for-change verbs, while their single outcome puts
them with the change-of-state verbs, whose single outcome may be a quantized or a non-quantized
change.

## Implementation notes

* Each `VerbOutcomes` fixes its outcome and threshold sets once per root and object, so the
  object-dependence the paper locates at the minimal verb phrase is modelled by distinct records
  for distinct objects.
* The degrees of affectedness are those the paper reports for its classes of verbs, and it reports
  none for the transformation, movement and creation classes. Its critique of Beavers's definition
  of potential for change (§6.1) is not formalized.
