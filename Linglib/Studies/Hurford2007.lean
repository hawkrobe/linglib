# Hurford (2007): A performed practice explains a linguistic universal

This file formalizes Hurford's explanation of the Packing Strategy by the practice of counting.
A counter goes as far as the recited sequence allows, sets what has been counted aside as a group,
gathers the groups into one of the next base up once there are enough of them, and counts the
groups and the remainder the same way. `count` computes the outcome over a language's list of
bases, and the numerals the Packing Strategy admits are exactly the ones counting produces.
Hurford's English, Mixtec and Hawaiian illustrations are packed and their starred rearrangements
are not, while English *twenty one hundred*, one of his rare exceptions, is attested but rejected.

## Main definitions

* `count`: counting with a list of bases

## Main results

* `packed_count`: counting reaches a packed numeral
* `packed_iff_eq_count`: the packed numerals are the outcomes of counting
* `Mixtec.count_eq_numeral7999`, `Hawaiian.count_eq_numeral609751`: counting reaches the paper's
  Mixtec and Hawaiian numerals
* `English.not_packed_twentyOneHundred`: the Packing Strategy rejects *twenty one hundred*

## Implementation notes

The trees use the 1975 grammar of `Numeral`, so a DIGIT is a tally and a PHRASE of a bare M is
`[one M]`. English *million* is the base-power M of value `10 ^ 6`, since the Packing Strategy
compares only values. The Mixtec bases are the three of the example and the Hawaiian ones the
seven Hurford lists.

counting sequence up to `v`; otherwise it sets aside as many groups of the highest base that fits
as possible, and counts the groups and the remainder the same way. -/
