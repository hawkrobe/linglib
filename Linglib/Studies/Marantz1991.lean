# Marantz (1991): Case and Licensing

This file formalizes the theory of morphological case in [marantz-1991]. Noun phrases are
licensed by projection and the requirement that clauses have subjects, and case is read off the
finished structure afterwards. A case affix takes the first case it is eligible for in a
disjunctive hierarchy: a case determined by a lexical head, then a dependent case, then the
unmarked case of its environment, then a default. The dependent cases are accusative and
ergative. The verb with its inflection assigns one to a position it governs when another
position it governs holds a distinct chain that no lexical head has marked, the accusative
downward to the object and the ergative upward to the subject.

Case goes to chains, not to positions. A subject that has moved from the object position is one
chain with its trace, so there is no second chain for a dependent case to be assigned against.
This one fact covers both what Burzio's generalization says about the accusative and what the
paper calls the ergative generalization, that a derived subject is never ergative. Whether the
subject position is thematic plays no part: a raised subject over a distinct object, as with
*strike*, leaves the object accusative. An unergative clause has an unfilled object position,
and languages differ in whether it counts as a position to assign the ergative against:
Georgian and Basque always count it, Hindi may, Inuktitut never does.

The split ergativity of Georgian follows. The inflection of the first series assigns
dependent case downward and that of the second upward, while the agreement on the inflection
finds its controller in the same way in both, taking the subject unless a lexical head has
marked it and the object otherwise.

## Main declarations

* `Clause`: a clause as the case rules see it, by what its subject and object positions hold;
  `Clause.chains` lists its chains.
* `Clause.subject`, `Clause.object`: the case of the two chains under given rules.
* `Setting`: the rules of an inflection, the visibility of unfilled positions and the names the
  language gives the cases; `georgian`, `hindi`, `basque`, `inuktitut`.
* `Clause.agr`: the position the agreement of the paper's (31) takes its features from.

## Main results

* `Clause.subject_dependent_iff`, `Clause.object_dependent_iff`: when each position has
  dependent case, the paper's (30).
* `Clause.ergative_generalization`: a subject moved from the object position has no dependent
  case, whatever the rules.
* `Clause.not_burzio`: a clause with a non-thematic subject position and an accusative object.
* `subject_rows`, `object_rows`: the cases of the paper's Georgian, Hindi and Basque examples.
* `georgian_subject_eq_pattern`, `georgian_object_eq_pattern`, `georgian_agr`: the rules derive
  the case marking and the Set A agreement of the Georgian fragment in the first two series.
* `ecm`: the embedded subject and object of an exceptional case marking clause are both
  accusative.

## Implementation notes

The argument that **It arrived the man* fails for want of a subject and not for want of Case,
and the residue of Case theory that governs PRO, are not formalized. Default case is not
modelled apart from unmarked case. The rules of `Syntax/Case/Dependent.lean` count a noun
phrase as a competitor while it is caseless, where the paper asks only that no lexical head
has marked it; the two agree when the domains of a sentence are run from the lowest up, as
they are in `ecm`. The third series of Georgian is outside the paper.
