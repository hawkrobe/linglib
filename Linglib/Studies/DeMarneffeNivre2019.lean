# de Marneffe and Nivre (2019): Dependency grammar

This file formalizes the formal claims of the review of dependency grammar in
[de-marneffe-nivre-2019] on the library's dependency graphs, whose projectivity is that of
[kuhlmann-nivre-2006]. A dependency tree is a spanning tree over the words of a sentence, §2.4,
and its projectivity has two formulations the review takes as equivalent, that every word
between the endpoints of an arc is dominated by the arc's head and that the yield of every
subtree is a contiguous substring; Figure 3 is nonprojective on both counts. Dependency trees
are insensitive to word order, §3.1, so the two orders of (1) are one graph relabelled along a
rotation of the positions. Dependency length, §3.2, explains the preference for (2a) over (2b)
and its absence between (3a) and (3b), the minimization of [behaghel-1932] and
[temperley-2007], and the object relative (4a) of [gibson-1998] holds its filler at a longer
distance than the subject relative (4b). Universal Dependencies, §4, puts content words above
function words, Figure 4b against the function-word-headed Figure 4a, the function words
attaching to the content word with which they form a nucleus in the sense of [tesniere-1959],
so that the content-word skeleton of a sentence is shared across languages, Figure 7; its basic
representation is a tree and its enhanced representation a general graph, in which the subject
of Figure 9 has three heads and lies on a cycle, §4.4.

## Implementation notes

The review's figures carry traditional grammatical-function labels, its footnote 2; the fixtures
use their Universal Dependencies counterparts, and the function-word-headed arcs of Figure 4a,
for which UD has no relation, carry `dep`. Punctuation is dropped from (1) so that its two orders
are exactly a rotation. The coreference relation of Figure 9's enhanced graph is not in the
library's relation inventory and is omitted; the multiple heads and the cycle do not depend on
it. The word strings and bubble trees of Figure 2, the nuclei of Figure 5 and the three label
inventories of Figure 6 are not representable on a single-labelled graph over words and are not
formalized.
