# Woodin, Winter, Littlemore, Perlman & Grieve (2024): Large-Scale Patterns of Number Use

Woodin et al. model the frequency of numbers in the British National Corpus: the log frequency
of a number is a linear function of its log magnitude and of which roundness properties it has.
The six properties are being a multiple of five or of ten and Jansen and Pollmann's four kinds of
`k`-ness over positive powers of ten. They nest, since 10-ness, 2-ness and 5-ness make a number a
multiple of ten and every property makes it a multiple of five, and with non-negative weights the
predicted frequency is monotone in the roundness ordering of `Numerals.Roundness`.

## Main results

* `dvd_five_of_holds`: every roundness property entails being a multiple of five.
* `predicted_le_iff`: a rounder number of comparable magnitude is predicted more frequent
  exactly when the weights of its extra properties outweigh the magnitude penalty.
* `predicted_99_le_100_iff`: the study's illustration with 99 and 100.

## Implementation notes

The fitted coefficients, the ordering of the properties by effect size, the residual analysis
of culturally salient numbers, and the register comparisons are results of the corpus study
and are not restated here; the theorems are over an arbitrary model, with the sign conditions
the study reports as hypotheses.
