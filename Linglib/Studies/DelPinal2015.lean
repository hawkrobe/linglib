# Del Pinal (2015): Dual Content Semantics, privative adjectives, and dynamic compositionality

Del Pinal's dual content semantics gives a common noun two parts, an E-structure that determines
its extension and a C-structure that assigns a property to each of the four qualia of
Pustejovsky. A privative adjective such as *fake* is a semantic restructuring operator, a
function from noun meanings to noun meanings that reads the noun's C-structure, so that a fake
gun is not a gun, was not made as a gun, and was made to look like one. The C-structure of the
result does further compositional work, in *typical fake gun* and in the two bracketings of
*fake plastic gun* and *fake Chanel handbag*. Against Partee's shifting heads, on which *fake* is
subsective once the head noun is coerced, the literal *fake N* needs no coercion, and a
first-order *fake* would make shifting heads read every fake gun as a gun.

## Main statements

* `disjoint_privativeE`: no fake, counterfeit or artificial N is an N.
* `typical_fake_formal_not_telic`: a typical fake N looks like an N and cannot serve as one,
  which a fake N need not do (`fake_not_formal_not_telic`).
* `typicalE_eq_cStructure`: where an N's C-structure is narrower than its extension, the typical
  Ns are those with the whole C-structure.
* `fake_bracketing`, `fake_brand_made_by_brand_reading`: *fake B N* denotes real Ns on
  [[fake B] N] and things that are not B Ns on [fake [B N]], so only the latter covers a fake
  handbag made by Chanel.
* `fake_isNonVacuous`, `fake_no_licensedCoercion`: the literal *fake N* has a positive and a
  negative extension, and no coercion of its head could be licensed.
* `shifting_heads_evil_park_owner`: with a first-order *fake*, one fake paintball gun that is a
  real gun makes shifting heads read every fake gun as a gun.

## Implementation notes

A dual content pairs the E-structure `N.extension` with the C-structure `N.quale`, whose values
are the paper's qualia functions; dual contents are ordered componentwise. The paper composes each
of a modifier's five components with the noun's full meaning; transposed, the five are one
`Modifier` of dual contents, and that composition rule is its application. A quale without a
value is the trivial property (footnote 10), so the intersective shift (20) is
`Modifier.intersective` on dual contents; brand names such as *Chanel* are taken to shift the
same way, the paper saying only that they add a condition to the agentive. The making events
`∃e[making(e) ∧ goal(e, P(x))]` are a primitive `made P`, which does not distinguish the
two-place *making* of (15).

## TODO

Section 3 also attributes to the bracketing [fake [plastic gun]] a reading on which a fake
plastic gun is a real gun made of plastic. The entry (16) applied to (21) does not derive it,
since the E-structure of *fake plastic gun* denies the compound *plastic gun*.
