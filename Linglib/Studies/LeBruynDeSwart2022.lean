# Le Bruyn and de Swart (2022): Exceptional Wide Scope of Bare Nominals

Bare plurals take narrow scope across languages, which Chierchia's kinds approach derives: the
bare plural denotes its kind, and derived kind predication introduces an existential over the
kind's instances where the kind meets the verb. Le Bruyn and de Swart observe that Dutch bare
plurals scrambled over negation take wide scope while keeping their kind reading. A kind takes no
scope, as a name takes none (Chierchia's §4.2), so the kinds approach still gives narrow scope
after scrambling, while Krifka's existential shift makes the bare plural a quantifier that takes
wide scope when scrambled.

## Main results

* `LeBruynDeSwart2022.chierchiaScrambled_iff`: on the kinds approach scrambling changes nothing.
* `LeBruynDeSwart2022.books_example`: on a two-book model of (35), Krifka's scrambled
  existential is true and both narrow readings are false.

## Implementation notes

* Individuals are Link's nonempty sets of atoms, `Plurality.Algebra.Individual`, so no empty
  plurality satisfies a distributive predicate vacuously. Both derivations quantify over all
  pluralities of books, the instances of the kind; the plural noun's own extension, without the
  atoms, would change no truth value on the model.
* The attested examples are rows of `Data/Examples/LeBruynDeSwart2022.json`.
