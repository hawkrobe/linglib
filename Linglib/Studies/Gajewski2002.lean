# Gajewski (2002): On Analyticity in Natural Language

This file formalizes [gajewski-2002]'s principle that a sentence is ungrammatical if its
logical form contains an L-analytic constituent, one that is true, or false, in virtue of its
logical structure alone. Logical structure has two ingredients, and the file formalizes both
halves of the paper.

The logical items are the denotations invariant under permutations of the domain, the
criterion of [van-benthem-1989]: a permutation of the entity domain lifts through the
`Montague.Ty` hierarchy (`permLift`), and an item is logical when every lifted permutation
fixes it (`PermutationInvariant`). Truth-functional conjunction is fixed because the lift is
the identity at type `t` (`permutationInvariant_and`), expletive *there*, which denotes the
whole domain, is fixed, and the domain and the empty set are the only invariant properties
(`permutationInvariant_et_iff`), so a contingent predicate like *new-student* is not a logical
item. Invariance at the determiner type is exactly the quantity invariance the Quantification
substrate states on `GQ` (`permutationInvariant_det_iff`), so the logicality of *every*, *some*
and *no* follows from the isomorphism invariance of their Lindström classes rather than being
stipulated. Von Fintel's *but* is a logical item too (`permutationInvariant_but`).

The logical skeleton of a sentence replaces each maximal constituent without logical items by
a distinct variable of its semantic type; a skeleton is a predicate on type-sorted assignments
(`Skeleton`, domains by `Montague.Ty.Domain`), and a sentence is L-analytic when its skeleton
receives one truth value under every assignment (`Skeleton.IsLAnalytic`). The principle puts
two analyses on firmer ground. [barwise-cooper-1981] explained the definiteness restriction on
*there*-sentences of [milsark-1977] by the tautology a strong determiner produces there: the
skeleton of *there is every new student* is an L-tautology because every set is a subset of
the domain (`thereSkeleton_isLTautology`), while with *some* or *two* the skeleton is false
under the empty assignment and true under a large enough one. [von-fintel-1993] explained the
restriction of *but*-exceptives to universal determiners by the contradiction his
least-exception semantics produces under a left-upward-monotone determiner, which admits no
nonempty least exception (`IsExceptionSet.eq_bot_of_restrictorMonotone`): the skeletons with
*some* and *three* are L-contradictions, and those with *every* and *no* are contingent. Both
analyses had appealed to trivial truth conditions, which *war is war* shows cannot be the
explanation, and L-analyticity is narrower than triviality: *every woman is a woman* and
*John is smoking and John is not smoking* receive skeletons with distinct variables for their
repeated material, which are contingent, so the garden-variety tautologies and contradictions
come out grammatical. The paper's sentences are the rows, and the principle predicts each
(`rows_predicted`) except the *most*-exceptive, the gap the paper's footnote on *most*
concedes and `exceptiveSkeleton_most_not_isLAnalytic` states.

## Implementation notes

* The paper's type hierarchy has `e`, `t` and function types only; `permLift` extends it to
  the rest of `Montague.Ty` by the identity at the degree, cardinality and eventuality sorts
  and pointwise at intensions, with `Unit` as the inert index sort of the extensional
  fragment.
* The denotation of *but* is the paper's schema factored compositionally, but where the
  printed uniqueness clause reads `g ⊆ j` the least-exception schema it factors requires
  `f ⊆ j`, so `but` is `IsExceptionSet` with the arguments rearranged; the exceptive skeleton
  carries the nonemptiness of the exception set that the paper's footnote adds to the schema.
* A row's L-analyticity quantifies over every reading of its determiner and every finite
  nonempty domain, following the model quantification of the paper's strength and
  monotonicity definitions; nonemptiness reflects the remark that the *some* skeleton is true
  on every nonempty value of its variable.
* The readings of *every*, *some* and *most* are the English fragment's; *no* is read from
  the quantification substrate because the fragment has no entry for the word, *a* is read as
  *some*, *everyone* as *every*, *someone* as *some*, and the numerals as *at least n*, the
  paper's own reading of *one, two* as left-upward-monotone determiners.
* The rows cover the sentences the paper derives. Its remaining printed examples are data
  only: *the wolf* needs a partial definite determiner, *John and Mary* is not a determiner,
  *many* has no fixed reading, and the paper derives no verdict for *exactly two* or *fewer
  than three*.
* The examples are `Data.Examples.Gajewski2002`.

## TODO

* A partial definite determiner would let the *the wolf* row join `rows_predicted`.
* Cardinality arguments for *exactly two* and *fewer than three* exceptives are in the later
  literature the paper's footnote cites, not in the paper.
* The English determiner fragment lacks *no*; adding it would let `Determiner.no` read from
  the fragment.
