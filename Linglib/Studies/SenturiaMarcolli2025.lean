# Senturia and Marcolli (2025): The Algebraic Structure of Morphosyntax

This file formalizes the Distributed Morphology operations of [senturia-marcolli-2025], which
models morphology inside the Merge algebra of [marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025]. A morphological
object is built by the same free non-associative commutative magma as a syntactic object, with
features in place of lexical items, and differs from it only in labeling: an internal vertex
carries the union of its children's feature bundles (Definition 2.1), so a bundle is derived
from the tree (`bundle`, `bundle_fuse`). A morphosyntactic tree inserts morphological objects
at the leaves of a syntactic tree under the syntax-morphology feature correspondence
(Definitions 2.4 and 3.4; `FeatureCorrespondence`, `Morphosyntactic`, `Matched`), and
forgetting the inserted morphology is the morphism of algebras over the Merge operad of
Definition 3.9 (`toSyntactic`).

On this carrier the four operations reduce to two. Fusion is the magma product itself
(Definition 5.2, `fuse`), which is why it is the one operation available inside syntax.
Fission restricts the tree vertex-wise along a partition of its bundle with a copied residue
(Definition 5.6, `restrict`) and duplicates exactly that residue (`msFeatures_fissionSite_copy`).
Impoverishment keeps one fission output and obliteration empties an insertion (Propositions
5.13 and 5.20), so both derive from fission (Proposition 5.21). Fission followed by fusion
restores the bundle but not the tree (`bundle_fuse_restrict`, `fuse_restrict_ne`, the paper's
Example 5.7). Closing the site relations under congruence gives the post-syntactic and
Distributed Morphology semigroups of Definition 6.1 as rewrite relations (`PostSyntactic`,
`Derivation`): along the first the total feature set is invariant while the boundary between
syntax and morphology moves one leaf at a time (`PostSyntactic.toFinset_msFeatures_eq`,
`Step.numLeaves_fuse`, `Step.numLeaves_fiss`); along the second the feature set can only
shrink (`Derivation.toFinset_msFeatures_subset`).

## Implementation notes

* Morphological objects are unordered trees over `F ⊕ Unit`, features at the leaves and bare
  structural vertices elsewhere. `IsMorphological` does not constrain arity, so the theorems
  cover the paper's binary objects and the non-branching extended objects of Definition 2.8
  alike. Restriction keeps a structural vertex whose leaves all vanish as a childless vertex
  where the quotient of Definition 5.6 removes it; both carry the empty bundle.
* A morphosyntactic tree is kept in labeled form, each syntactic leaf carrying its datum and
  the inserted object, `none` for the empty insertion of Remark 5.12; this carries the same
  data as splicing the object below the leaf.
* The operations are stated as transformations of morphosyntactic trees, the first of the
  paper's two equivalent perspectives; the semigroups act on trees rather than on the assembly
  operations of Definition 4.2.

## TODO

The workspace Hopf algebra with obliteration via the coproduct, and the colored correspondence
between the syntactic and morphosyntactic algebras over the Merge operad (Theorem 3.16).

/-! ### Morphological objects and the derived bundle labeling

A morphological object is a nonplanar tree with single features at the
leaves and bare structural vertices elsewhere — the alphabet `F ⊕ Unit`,
exactly the carrier shape of syntactic objects with features in place of
the lexical items. Definition 2.1 of [senturia-marcolli-2025] labels
each internal vertex with the union of its children's bundles, so every
vertex label is determined by the leaves below it; `bundle` is the
root's. -/

/-- Features occur only at leaves: internal vertices are structural.
Arity is not constrained, so the predicate covers the paper's binary
objects and the non-branching extended objects of Definition 2.8 that
restriction produces. -/

into one ([senturia-marcolli-2025] §5.1, Swahili negation *si-* fusing

magma operation itself — grafting under a fresh structural root — which

Fission splits one bundle into two along a partition `B ∖ A = B₁ ⊔ B₂`,

§5.2; the discontinuous agreement of Ṣanʕānī Arabic after [hewett-2023],
where person and number of a single head surface as prefix and suffix).
Each output is the input
tree restricted vertex-wise to the kept features: leaves outside the
kept set are deleted, structural vertices stay, and vanished subtrees
may leave non-branching structural vertices behind — the extended
morphological objects. -/

/-! ### Impoverishment as fission plus fusion

[senturia-marcolli-2025] Propositions 5.20–5.21: impoverishment and
obliteration are not independent operations. Discarding a subbundle is
keeping one fission output (`bundle_restrict` with the kept part as
`C`); the trace-maintaining variant fissions and refuses at the same
vertex, restoring the bundle without restoring the tree. Obliteration
replaces a whole morphological object by the unit of the workspace
algebra, which lives in the second slice. -/

impoverishment composite leaves the feature content intact. -/

/-! ### The tree is not restored

Fission at a partition whose residue is copied into both outputs, then
fusion, restores the bundle but not the tree: the copied feature now
occupies a leaf on each side, so the composite has strictly more leaves.
The witness is [senturia-marcolli-2025] Example 5.7: `[φ, α, β, γ]` with
kept sets `[φ, γ]` and `[φ, α, β]`. -/

/-! ### The syntax-morphology correspondence and morphosyntactic trees

A morphosyntactic tree inserts morphological objects at the leaves of a
syntactic tree, constrained by a matching rule between the bundle at the
root of the inserted object and the syntactic datum at the leaf
([senturia-marcolli-2025] Definitions 2.4 and 3.4). We keep the
insertion as a leaf label — syntactic datum paired with the inserted
object — which carries the same data as splicing the object below the
leaf. -/

/-! ### One-step transformations and the post-syntactic semigroup

The DM operations act anywhere in a morphosyntactic tree: a step applies
a site transformation at the root of some subtree. Compositions of such
steps form [senturia-marcolli-2025] Definition 6.1's semigroups — the
post-syntactic semigroup generated by fusion and fission, and the full
Distributed Morphology semigroup adding impoverishment and obliteration.
Their action is the movable syntax-morphology boundary: `PostSyntactic`
preserves the total feature set exactly, and `Derivation` can only
shrink it. -/

inside one subtree. -/
