# Bhatt and Pancheva (2004): Late Merger of Degree Clauses

Bhatt and Pancheva propose that a degree clause, the *than*- or *as*-phrase, is merged
countercyclically as the complement of the degree head after the head has raised to its scope
position, so the surface site of the clause marks the scope of the comparison. This refines
Williams's generalization: the degree head scopes at least as high as its clause, by
countercyclic merger, and exactly as high, because Trace Conversion would otherwise intersect the
clause into the second argument of the nonconservative *-er* and yield a contradiction.

## Main results

* `hkc_22`, `hkc_43`: the Heim–Kennedy constraint excludes the LFs (22b) and (43b).
* `at_least_as_high`, `exactly_as_high`: the Extraposition-Scope Generalization, (39), on the
  rows.
* `ellipsisScope`: the Ellipsis-Scope Generalization, (59), on the LFs of (62).
* `conditionC_scope`: the Condition C–Scope Generalization on the LFs of (69).
* `erSem_not_conservative`: *-er* is not conservative, (86), so the clause merges only at the
  DegP's scope position.

## Implementation notes

* LFs are category-free trees at the paper's bracketing, `Syntax.Tree Unit String`, with
  non-branching and elided material written as one leaf; scope is `Branching.cCommandAt` and the
  constraint `Minimalist.IsHeimKennedy` on it.
* The comparative of (84) is `erSem`, proper inclusion of degree sets, and (85) is its value on
  [kennedy-1999]'s positive extents; Trace Conversion itself is not formalized, only the second
  argument it hands `-er`.
* Section 4.2 is [heim-2000]'s result and is `Heim2001.forall_collapse`; the ordering constraint
  between *than*- and result clauses, (48) and (50), and the ellipsis resolution of Section 6.3
  are recorded as rows.
