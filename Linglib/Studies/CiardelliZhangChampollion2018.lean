# Ciardelli, Zhang and Champollion 2018: Two switches in the theory of counterfactuals

Two switches at the ends of a hallway control a light, on iff they are in the same position;
both are up and the light is on (Fig. 1). Participants judged *if switch A were down, the light
would be off* and its B counterpart true by a majority, and *if switch A or switch B were down*
likewise, but not *if switches A and B were not both up, the light would be off*, though its
antecedent is the De Morgan equivalent of the disjunction (Table 3). The contrast falsifies
every minimal-change semantics, not one choice of similarity: whenever the two simple
counterfactuals are true, any counterfactual quantifying over the closest antecedent worlds
makes the not-both-up one true as well, a closest not-both-up world in which A is down being a
closest A-down world (§1.2), and the argument extends to [kratzer-1981]'s premise semantics
(§6.3). The paper's positive proposal, a background semantics with the inquisitive lifting of
disjunction (§3.2, §4), is not represented.

The four worlds, the wiring law and the five clauses are `World`, `lightOn` and the
propositions `aDn` to `lightOff`, with `aOrBdn_eq_notBothUp` the De Morgan identity; under the
Hamming similarity `hammingSim` the conditional of the closest worlds, `Conditional.closestImp`,
makes all four counterfactuals true at the actual world, and `selectionalCounterfactual` and
`homogeneityCounterfactual` make the falsified one true as well. `minimal_change_forces_notBothUp`
is the §1.2 argument for any similarity ordering and consequent: a closest world of a union is a
closest world of one of its parts (`Preorder.minimals_union_subset`); the three
operators' versions are corollaries.
The Table 3 counts are the rationals `trueRate_*`, `table3_pattern` the majority pattern the
paper reads off them and `deMorgan_antecedents_diverge` the divergence of the equivalent pair.
