# Everdell (2023): Arguments and Adjuncts in O'dam, Chapter 5

This file formalizes the account of applicativization in O'dam (Southeastern Tepehuan) in
Chapter 5 of [everdell-2023]. The applicative suffixes *-dha* and *-tuda* add exactly one
syntactic argument, and the thematic role of that argument is predictable from the argument
structure of the base verb through the hierarchy (273): an agent is added to a base with a
single distinct argument; failing that, an entailed participant that is not a syntactic object
and is compatible with an animate referent is promoted to object; failing that, a beneficiary
is added, which makes benefaction the elsewhere function of the applicatives rather than
their core. A base with three arguments takes no applicative, since a verb of O'dam has at
most three: hypertransitivity is banned, so the ditransitives 'give' and 'ask' have no
applied form.

`Base.arguments` counts the base's arguments as the applicative counts them: the subject and
the objects co-referenced on the verb, plus the incorporated nominal of a denominal *-ta* verb
of creation, minus an object not maximally distinct from the subject in the sense of
[naess-2007], which is what unites the exceptional transitives of Table 5.2 (lexical middles,
verbs of ingestion, verbs of perception). Entailed participants that are not objects, whether
implicit objects or entailed locations, do not count. That is the chapter's argument that
locative expressions and instruments are adjuncts: a motion verb co-referencing only its
subject gains an agent like any intransitive, and an entailed location is promoted the way an
implicit object is.

`rows` are the chapter's verbs (Tables 5.1, 5.2, 5.6 and 5.7, the promotion cases of §5.2 and
§5.3, the ditransitives, the denominal verbs of creation and the suppletive paradigms of
§5.4), and `rows_role` derives each one's attested function, an applicative attaching only to
the alternant of a suppletive paradigm with the most arguments. `role_eq_beneficiary_iff` is
the chapter's two-part elsewhere condition and `role_eq_none_iff` the hypertransitivity ban.
`causativizability` places O'dam on the causativizability hierarchy of [krejci-2012], which
the chapter invokes to explain why ingestives and middles pattern with intransitives: the
applicatives reach unergatives but not simple transitives.

## Implementation notes

* Promotion is modelled by its precondition. The applied form entails that the promoted
  participant is animate, so only a participant compatible with an animate referent is
  promotable: implicit objects (buyers, hearers, the person something is hidden from) always
  are, entailed locations are or are not by the speakers' judgments (§5.3 against §5.4.1),
  and instruments never are, since a *-k1'n* 'with' phrase rejects an animate referent. The
  chapter's case that promotion adds animacy rather than the change of possession of the
  dative alternation ([beavers-nishida-2010]) or of Kinyarwanda applicatives stays in prose:
  the possession implicature runs from the promoted source to the subject with *baabu'*
  'take out from under' and is absent with *nui'ña'* 'push'.
* The agent-adding use is the causative-applicative syncretism of [shibatani-pardeshi-2002],
  which the chapter declines to read as two morphemes: one suffix adds an agent or an object
  depending on the base. Unlike the Kinyarwanda *-ish* of [jerro-2017], an O'dam applicative
  has one function with a given base; the two senses of *m11ya'* ('burn', 'ignite') are two
  bases.
* Verb classes are only those the chapter names; the Table 5.1 verbs it does not classify are
  `Class.plain`. The subtype of a beneficiary (deputative, recipient, basic) and the role of
  an entailed participant are recorded in the rows and play no part in the model.

## TODO

* *torkia'* 'bark' is the one base with two functions (agent as a verb of sound emission,
  promotion of the addressee as a verb of speaking), and *aga'* 'talk' and *jiiñkia'* 'yell'
  promote a hearer they do not entail, by analogy with the speaking class; the rows record
  only the sound-emission use of *torkia'*.
* The denominal *mar-ta'* 'have children' and *ak-cha'* 'make a river' take an applicative
  whose applied object is a co-agent or the diverted theme rather than a beneficiary; the
  model predicts of them only that no agent is added.
