# Rudin (2025): Embedded Intonation and Quotative Complements to Verbs of Speech

Rudin gives a double-Davidsonian semantics for quotative complements to verbs of speech and
applies it to embedded rising declaratives. A quotation is a performance that the report refers
to demonstratively, and the quotative complementizer relates it to the speech event by
reenactment, so *Ayka said "p"* denotes the saying events that the performance reenacts. A verb
of speech is fixed by a meaning postulate over reenactments, so quoting a performance under a
verb is contradictory exactly when the performance lacks the verb's property: karate gestures
under *say*, a whisper under *yell*, a rising declarative under *assert*. A rising declarative
under *ask* is consistent, because its utterance raises an issue without a commitment that could
resolve it, an asking in Farkas and Bruce's Table model, so embedded rising declaratives are no
evidence that rising declaratives denote questions.

## Main definitions

* `speechVerb`: a verb of speech under the paper's meaning-postulate template.
* `quoteReport`: a quotative speech report.
* `Performance.Asking`: a performance that raises an issue without commitment.

## Main results

* `exists_reenact_iff`: a quotative report is satisfiable exactly when the performance has the
  verb's property.
* `Performance.asking_iff`: an asking is a rising declarative or an interrogative.
* `ask_risingDeclarative`: a rising declarative under *ask* is satisfiable.
* `judgments`: the paper's quotative judgments.

## Implementation notes

Reenactment is an `EventRel`, and the model is left free: a
quotative report is consistent when some reenactment relation makes it true. A performance is
its linguistic material, none for karate gestures, inarticulate for a howl or a random string,
or the utterance of a sentence with its clause type, radical and tune, together with its
volume. Its context update is the paper's: a falling declarative is a default assertion, a
rising declarative places its proposition on the Table without commitment, and an
interrogative is a default polar question. Askings and assertions are the paper's
configurations of these primitives, quantified over contexts. The paper states the postulates
for *say* and *ask*; the properties for *yell*, *whisper*, *assert* and *claim* are the ones
its discussion of those verbs invokes. Interrogative grunts, which the paper takes to raise an
issue without uttering a sentence, are not represented.
