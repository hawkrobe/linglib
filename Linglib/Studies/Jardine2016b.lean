# Jardine (2016): intervocalic voicing as a local string relation

This file formalizes chapter 7 of [jardine-2016b], which presents a phonological process as a
relation between input and output strings: a set of correspondence graphs, carved out of GEN by
banned-subgraph constraints. Section 7.2 runs the idea on intervocalic voicing, (7.1), whose
relation over `a`, `b` and `p` is `Rvoice`, (7.5). The primitives Γ of (7.14), an input symbol
over its output, generate GEN by concatenation, (7.15) (`g`), and five banned subgraphs cut the
voicing relation out of it: φ_apa, (7.19), forbids a surface `apa`, and the four of (7.21) forbid
a `p` surfacing as `b` word-initially, word-finally, after a `p` and before a `p`. The grammar is
φ_apba, (7.22), and the relation it presents is `R(CG(φ_apba))`, Definition 25 (`voicing`): a
pair is in it iff the Γ-string spelling it, which is unique, is free of the grammar
(`voicing_iff_spell`), so membership decides, and on the pairs of (7.5) and (7.17) the relation
agrees with `Rvoice` (`rows_agree`). The identity `R(CG(φ_apba)) = Rvoice` that the text leaves
to the reader fails: no subgraph of (7.22) mentions a `b` beside the target, so the grammar admits
`bpa ↦ bba`, which the rule (7.1) does not (`voicing_ne_voiceRule`).

## Implementation notes

* Correspondence graphs are `Autosegmental.Correspondence.Rep`; the word boundaries ⋊ and ⋉
  that (7.21) reads are symbols of the alphabet, and a Γ-string's graph is wrapped in them.
* `Rvoice` is written as the rule (7.1) applied pointwise, `voiceRule`, a `p` between two `a`s
  surfacing as `b`.
