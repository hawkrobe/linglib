# Snyder (2026): Numbers as Kinds

This file formalizes [snyder-2026]'s Polymorphic Contextualism: the lexical meaning of *two* is
an atomic predicate applying to different countable entities in different contexts, numeral
tokens, subkinds of the kind TWO, or TWO itself, and every other meaning of the word derives
from it by type-shifting. The rival polymorphic analyses take the lexical meaning to be a
numeral, an entity from which the cardinality predicate derives by CARD (Substantivalism), or
the cardinality predicate itself, from which the numeral derives by NOM and Rothstein's
schematic equation (Adjectivalism). The three analyses are derivation maps from a lexical
type through the type-shifters CARD, PM, A, NOM, IOTA and IDENT to the semantic functions of
(1) and (76) (`PolymorphicAnalysis.path`), each of which composes to the function's type
(`analyses_well_typed`); Contextualism derives every function while the two rivals derive
none of the token, kind and taxonomic uses (`contextualism_covers_all`,
`substantivalism_gap`, `adjectivalism_gap`, `contextualism_strictly_extends`). Numbers are
kinds formed as in [mendia-2020] by a salient equivalence relation on their tokens, here the
number system a token belongs to (`kfTWO`), so distinct subkinds of TWO are disjoint
(`subkinds_distinct`); a close appositive is the Sharvy definite over the conjunction of its
two nouns (`closeAppositive`), and definites over disjoint restrictions of the extension of
*two* refer to distinct subkinds, which dissolves Benacerraf's Identification Problem for (20)
(`closeAppositive_ne_of_disjoint`, `identification_problem_resolved`). Section 6 extends the
analysis to colour words, RED having subkinds such as crimson and maroon (`kfRed`,
`red_subkinds_distinct`). The examples are rows of `Data/Examples/Snyder2026`, each of which
carries its semantic function, and every function is attested (`functions_attested`).

## Implementation notes

* Types are the fragment e, ⟨e,t⟩ and ⟨⟨e,t⟩,t⟩; PM is monadic, its second predicate supplied
  by the syntax. Rothstein's schematic equation is a meta-level identification and not a
  type-shifter, so the adjectivalist numeral is the nominalized cardinality predicate with the
  equation read off it.
* In the contextualist diagram the token, kind and taxonomic uses (76h), (76j) and (76f) are
  the lexical predicate itself, applied to tokens or kinds, and the numeral, kind-referring
  and token-referring uses (76e), (76i) and (76g) are IOTA over it; the taxonomic use is
  predicate-typed, the others entity-typed.
* Sharvy's definite is a partial operation over a finite domain, undefined when no or more
  than one entity satisfies the restriction; the Identification Problem is worked on a domain
  with one token per number system.
