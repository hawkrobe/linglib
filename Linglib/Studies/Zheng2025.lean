# Zheng (2025): Nandao-Qs, When Surprise Sparks Inquiry

This file formalizes [zheng-2025]'s felicity conditions for Mandarin *nandao* questions, which
are driven by unexpected contextual evidence rather than by the speaker's epistemic bias. The
conditions are stated over [von-fintel-gillies-2010]'s kernel, the set of propositions directly
available in the context: some piece of evidence in the kernel raises the probability of the
prejacent (`evidenceSupports`), the kernel conflicts with the information state `U` in place
before the evidence, the beliefs, norms, desires or default expectations of the speaker
(`unexpected`), and the prejacent is not itself directly settled in the kernel
(`nandaoFelicitous`, the final condition (11)). Generalized to questions through the
instantiations of the question's highlighted property, (13), the first condition requires
every instantiation to follow from the evidence (`nandaoQFelicitous`), which reduces to (11)
for a polar question (`nandaoQFelicitous_singleton`) and excludes a wh-question one of whose
instantiations no evidence supports (`not_nandaoQFelicitous_of_unsupported`), the paper's
derivation of the distribution recorded in the fragment (`nandao_distribution`, (12)).

The dripping-raincoat scenario of (2), (3) and (5) is a four-world model: the question is
felicitous whether the conflicting state is a belief that it is not raining or the default
expectation that people do not wear raincoats (`raincoat_nandao_felicitous`,
`raincoat_default_felicitous`), and infelicitous without the evidence
(`no_evidence_infelicitous`) or when the evidence is expected
(`expected_evidence_infelicitous`), which is (6). The link to rhetorical questions in §5 runs
through [farkas-2025]'s closed-question condition: a closed polar question is resolved in the
common ground whenever the speaker's beliefs are consistent with it (`resolved_of_closed_polar`),
the argument of the paper's footnote on (17).

## Implementation notes

* The paper's "significantly raises" is sharpened to strict raising of the conditional
  probability under the uniform counting measure on a finite set of worlds
  (`evidenceRaises`).
* The information state `U` is a list of propositions, like the kernel; the default state of the
  paper's footnote is one such proposition.
* Highlighted properties enter only through their set of instantiations.
