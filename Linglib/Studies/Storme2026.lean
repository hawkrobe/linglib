# Storme (2026): A Method to Evaluate Systemic Constraints in Probabilistic Grammars

This file formalizes [storme-2026]'s method for fitting systemic constraints, those that
score several input-output mappings jointly, in probabilistic constraint-based grammars: a
maximum-entropy distribution is evaluated over the joint tableau of output tuples and the
probability of each mapping is recovered by marginalization. With the systemic weights at
zero the marginal is the classical maximum-entropy probability of the mapping
(`marginal_eq_classical_of_systemic_zero`). The case study is variable hiatus resolution in
spoken Persian ([ariyaee-jurgec-2021]): the suffix vowel of the possessive /hutʃɑ-emun/
usually deletes while that of the definite /hutʃɑ-e/ rarely does, since deleting it would
make the suffixed form homophonous with the bare stem. The paradigm is two junctures over
Persian segments (`definite`, `possessive`), homophony is string identity
(`homophonyAvoidance`, `starHomophony`), and the joint tableau puts \*HOMOPHONY beside the
jointly evaluated classical constraints (`jointCon`), with the mapping probabilities its
marginals (`predicted`).

On this paradigm \*HOMOPHONY coincides with the jointly evaluated REALIZEMORPHEME of
[kurisu-2001] that [ariyaee-jurgec-2021] use, so the marginalized model is their classical
one (`starHomophony_eq_joint_realizeMorpheme`, `predicted_eq_softmax`). Whatever the
weights, the suffix-length effect on deletion, in log-odds against faithful hiatus, is
exactly the \*HOMOPHONY weight (`log_odds_deletion_sub`), deletion is less likely for the
monosegmental suffix whenever that weight is positive (`deletion_lt_deletion`), and without
\*HOMOPHONY the two suffixes receive identical distributions (`classical_no_length_effect`).
At the paper's fitted weights the predicted orders are those of its Table 5 (`mono_order`,
`poly_order`).

## Implementation notes

The fitted weights are the paper's posterior means, with MAX fixed at one as in the paper;
the theorems about the suffix-length effect are stated for arbitrary weights and only the
preference orders use the fitted values. The base's single faithful candidate enters the
tableau as the bare stem. The paper's model comparison by deviance information criterion
is not formalized.

/-- \*HOMOPHONY counts the pairs of distinct inputs that receive identical outputs. It is a
systemic constraint, one that scores a whole output tuple and not a single mapping, so it is a

penalizing a null realization of the suffix ([kurisu-2001]'s
REALIZEMORPHEME) in place of \*HOMOPHONY. [storme-2026] notes that the two
coincide here, and that only the systemic constraint extends to homophony
avoidance not involving a null morpheme. -/

surfacing as its bare stem. -/
