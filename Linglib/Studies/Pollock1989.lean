# Pollock (1989): Verb Movement, Universal Grammar, and the Structure of IP

This file formalizes [pollock-1989]'s account of the placement of French and English verbs
relative to negation, adverbs, floating quantifiers, and the subject. The clause is
`[TP T [NegP Neg [AgrP Agr [VP Adv V]]]]`, and a verb moves head to head: to Agr, the short
movement that carries it past an adverb, and from Agr to T, the long movement that carries it
past negation and lets it invert with the subject. A head that is opaque to θ-role assignment
blocks the movement of a verb with θ-roles to assign, since the raised verb could no longer
assign them, and only a verb with none, the auxiliaries *be* and *have*, may pass. English Agr
is opaque and French Agr transparent; nonfinite T is opaque in both languages. Finite T is an
operator that must bind a verb trace, so in a finite clause a verb rises as high as it can,
and when it cannot rise at all the tense affix lowers onto it and *do* supports it under
negation.

The heights a verb can reach are `Reaches`; from it follow the paper's generalizations: long
movement passes through short movement, auxiliaries reach T in every clause, no lexical verb
reaches nonfinite T in either language, lexical verbs move at all exactly in French, and
do-support arises exactly in English finite clauses with a lexical verb (`reaches_tense_imp_agr`,
`auxiliary_reaches_tense`, `lexical_not_reaches_nonfinite_tense`, `lexical_reaches_agr_iff`,
`needsDo_iff`). The paradigm of examples (2) to (39), forty rows over finite and nonfinite
clauses of both languages, is accounted for row by row: a row is excluded exactly when no
admissible height puts the verb where the row puts it (`paradigm`).

## Implementation notes

The θ-theoretic mechanism is represented by its effect, which head hosts which verb, not by
θ-grids and chains; the ban on vacuous quantification likewise by the obligatoriness of the
highest reachable position in finite clauses. Marginal rows are counted as admitted, as the
paper treats their degradation as stylistic. The structure of TP with *do*, imperatives,
gerunds, and the ECP account of why *not* alone blocks affix lowering are not formalized.
