# Pylkkänen (2008): Introducing Arguments

Pylkkänen's inventory of argument-introducing heads underlies two typologies. Applicative heads
are high or low: a high applicative relates the applied argument to the event and combines with
the verb phrase by Event Identification, and a low applicative relates it to the verb's theme
by a transfer of possession and takes the verb as its argument. Causative heads share one
meaning, Cause, which relates a causing event to a caused one and introduces no individual;
they vary in whether Cause is bundled with Voice and in whether it selects a root, a verb or a
phase. The diagnostics that separate the heads, such as the restriction of low applicatives to
structures with a direct object, are facts about semantic types, derived here by the
type-driven composition engine.

## Main definitions

* `lowAppl`: the low applicative.
* `cause`: Cause, the meaning shared by every causative head.
* `CauseHead.Embeds`: the layers a causative head's complement may contain.

## Main results

* `composes_unergative_iff`: only high applicatives combine with unergatives.
* `lowAppl_agent_eq_bot`: a low applicative over an unergative makes the object agent and theme.
* `cause_voice_order`: Cause applies before Voice.
* `hasCauseePosition_iff`: a root-selecting, Voice-bundling causative leaves no causee position.

## Implementation notes

Semantic types are those of `Montague.Ty`, in which events share the type `e` with
individuals, as in the composition engine: the book's `⟨s,t⟩` is `Ty.et` and `⟨e,⟨s,t⟩⟩` is
`Ty.eet`. A constituent fails to compose with another exactly when `tyBinary` returns `none`.

The third applicative diagnostic, the availability of the applied argument for depictive
modification, is also a typing fact in the book: a depictive phrase is of type ⟨e,⟨s,t⟩⟩ and
combines by Predicate Modification with constituents of that type, which a high Appl' is and a
low Appl' is not. The engine's predicate modification is at `⟨e,t⟩` only, so that diagnostic is
recorded in the data rows only.

The Voice-bundling status of the Bemba, Luganda, and Venda causatives is unknown (Table 3.1,
note a), so only the English, Japanese, and Finnish heads are given as `CauseHead` values.

## TODO

The second applicative diagnostic (18), that low applicatives are nonsensical with completely
static verbs such as *hold*, is a fact about the plausibility of the transfer of possession
(15) asserts, not a typing fact: the low ApplP composes with a static transitive verb
(`lowApplP_composes_transitive`). Since the transfer relation of (15) is not relativized to the
event, the clash with a static event does not follow from the denotation; the study records the
book's correlation of the two tests across Table 2.1 (`table21_static_iff_unergative`).
