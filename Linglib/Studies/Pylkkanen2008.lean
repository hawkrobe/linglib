# Pylkkänen (2008): Introducing Arguments

This file formalizes [pylkkanen-2008]'s inventory of argument-introducing heads (Table 1.1) and
the two typologies built on it. Applicative heads are high or low: a high applicative relates
the applied argument to the event and combines with the verb phrase by Event Identification, a
low applicative relates it to the verb's theme by a transfer-of-possession relation and takes
the verb as its argument (15). Causative heads share one meaning, Cause (9), which relates a
causing event to a caused one and introduces no individual; they vary in whether Cause is
bundled with Voice into one head and in whether it selects a root, a verb, or a phase.

The first applicative diagnostic, that only high applicatives combine with unergatives, is a
fact about semantic types, and is derived from the types of (13) and (15) by the type-driven
composition engine (`composes_unergative_iff`, checked against the six languages of Table 2.1
in `table21_unergative`). Over an unergative, the one constituent of the type a low applicative
needs is the Voice' whose open argument is the agent, and composing (15) with it makes the
applied-to object both agent and theme of the event, the contradiction of (103b)
(`lowAppl_agent_eq_bot`). The causative claims of §3.2 and §3.3 are typing facts as well: Cause
and Voice cannot combine with each other, Cause must apply before Voice (`cause_voice_order`),
and only the bieventive Cause yields a causative with no individual argument
(`unaccusative_causative`). The predictions of Tables 3.1 and 3.2 are derived from
`CauseHead.Embeds`, the layers a causative head's complement may contain; their joint corollary is
that a root-selecting, Voice-bundling causative leaves no position for a causee.

## Implementation notes

Semantic types are those of `Semantics.Composition.Ty`, in which events share the type `e` with
individuals, as in the composition engine: the book's `⟨s,t⟩` is `Ty.et` and `⟨e,⟨s,t⟩⟩` is
`Ty.eet`. A constituent fails to compose with another exactly when `tyBinary` returns `none`.

The third applicative diagnostic, the availability of the applied argument for depictive
modification, is also a typing fact in the book: a depictive phrase is of type ⟨e,⟨s,t⟩⟩ and
combines by Predicate Modification with constituents of that type, which a high Appl' is and a
low Appl' is not. The engine's predicate modification is at `⟨e,t⟩` only, so that diagnostic is
recorded in the data rows only.

The Voice-bundling status of the Bemba, Luganda, and Venda causatives is unknown (Table 3.1,
note a), so only the English, Japanese, and Finnish heads are given as `CauseHead` values.

## TODO

The second applicative diagnostic (18), that low applicatives are nonsensical with completely
static verbs such as *hold*, is a fact about the plausibility of the transfer of possession
(15) asserts, not a typing fact: the low ApplP composes with a static transitive verb
(`lowApplP_composes_transitive`). Since the transfer relation of (15) is not relativized to the
event, the clash with a static event does not follow from the denotation; the study records the
book's correlation of the two tests across Table 2.1 (`table21_static_iff_unergative`).
