# Beavers and Zubair (2013): Anticausatives in Sinhala

This file formalizes Beavers and Zubair's analysis of anticausatives in Colloquial Sinhala. A
causative root has two involitive detransitives, one with a nominative subject and no entailed
external causer and one with an accusative subject and an entailed external causer. Causer
suppression (77) derives both. It removes the causer from the verb's arguments, keeps the
causation and restricts the suppressed causer to individuals, and that causer is then either the
patient, as in Chierchia's and Koontz-Garboden's reflexivization, or existentially bound, as in
Levin and Rappaport Hovav's analysis (78). The accusative marks the second reading, as a semantic
case in Beavers and Zubair's earlier work. A verb selects the sort of its causer from the typology
(81), and suppression applies only when that sort includes the individuals, so *minimarannə*
'murder' and *kapannə* 'cut', which select events, have no inchoative. Since the volitive (71)
requires an event subject and an anticausative's subject is an individual, anticausatives are
involitive.

## Main definitions

* `CauserSort`: the typology (81), ordered by inclusion of basic sorts.
* `causerSuppress`, `Reading.resolve`: causer suppression and the two resolutions of the
  suppressed causer.
* `caseOfReading`: accusative marks existential resolution.
* `Root.causerSort`, `Anticausativizes`: the sort each root selects, and the condition of (77).

## Main results

* `CauserSort.not_event_le_individual`: anticausatives are never volitive.
* `reflexive_resolve_eq_reflexivize`: reflexive resolution is Koontz-Garboden's reflexivization.
* `causative_entails_existential`: the inchoative is true whenever the causative is.
* `ibeem_incompatible_with_external`: *ibeemə* 'by itself' excludes the accusative variant.
* `anticausativizes_iff_alternates`: the roots that meet (77) are those with an inchoative.
* `hasInvolitive_of_anticausativizes`, `exists_hasInvolitive_not_anticausativizes`: a root with
  an inchoative has an involitive stem, but the involitive does not mark anticausatives.

## Implementation notes

Sorts are checked rather than denoted. `causerSuppress` takes a proof that the root's causer sort
includes the individuals in place of the conjunct `x ∈ U_I` of (77), and the volitive's sort
condition is `CauserSort.event ≤ s`. *kada-* 'break' selects the whole domain as in (76), which
revises the eventualities of (65a).

The domain is sorted into individuals and eventualities, and the eventualities into events and
states (§4.3). A verb's causer ranges over one of the sorts of the typology (81). -/

the events being the dynamic eventualities. -/

It is defined only for a root whose causer sort includes the individuals. -/

/-- An anticausativized verb has two readings (78), on which the suppressed causer is coindexed
with the patient or existentially closed. -/
inductive Reading where
  | reflexive
  | existential
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- A reading's denotation binds the open causer that `causerSuppress` leaves to the patient
under reflexive resolution and closes it under existential resolution. The verb takes its causer
first, so `vp x y` has causer `x` and patient `y`. -/

/-- Any causative claim entails the existentially resolved inchoative. Inchoatives are true in
agentive contexts ((51), §5.3), so the ban on volitive inchoatives is formal rather than
truth-conditional. -/
