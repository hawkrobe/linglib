# Charlow 2018: a modular theory of pronouns and binding

The standard theory of pronouns ([heim-kratzer-1998]) makes every meaning depend on an
assignment and composes by handing one assignment to both daughters. [charlow-2018] factors this
into two operations: a lift `ρ x := λg. x` for meanings that do not depend on the assignment, and
an application `m ⊛ n := λg. m g (n g)` used only where it is needed. Together they make
assignment-dependent meanings an applicative functor. A flattener `μ m := λg. m g g` for pronouns
whose value is an intension then makes them a monad. These are the `pure`, `<*>` and `joinM` of
Lean's reader monad, so the laws the paper lists are the reader monad's own. Abstraction becomes
an ordinary operation on meanings where the standard rule can only have it as a special rule, and
paycheck pronouns and binding reconstruction follow from pronouns whose values are intensions.

Those analyses store intensions in assignments. Assignments that can store every intension exist
only over a one-element domain, by Cantor's diagonal argument. This is the difficulty the paper
cites in section 5, whose type-homogeneous assignments avoid it: two composed reader applicatives
derive the paycheck reading with no flattener. The pronouns of variable-free semantics
([jacobson-1999]) use the same applicative at the entity type.

## Main results

* `not_exists_abstraction_denotation`: under the standard rule no denotation of `Λᵢ` binds
* `hamblin_seq`: Hamblin's pointwise application is the `<*>` of sets
* `joinM_joinM`, `joinM_pure_seq_pure`: the monad laws in the paper's form
* `paycheck`, `reconstruction`: the paycheck reading and binding reconstruction
* `subsingleton_of_forall_store`: assignments storing every intension are trivial
* `typed_paycheck`: the paycheck reading on type-homogeneous assignments

## Implementation notes

`ρ`, `⊛` and `μ` are not defined here: they are `pure`, `<*>` and `joinM` of
`ReaderM (Assignment E)`, and the composition of two applicatives (Fig. 5) is mathlib's
`Functor.Comp`. For section 4, `G` is an abstract type of assignments with lookups for individual
variables and for variables over individual concepts, and a shift `g^{i→x}` for each; each
derivation assumes only the laws it uses, for the one intension it stores. As in the paper,
`likes x y` is "`y` likes `x`".

## TODO

* Section 4.3: composing sets with the reader (`S ∘ G`) admits no lawful flattener.

/-! ### Abstraction under the standard theory

The standard rule interprets a branching node by giving both daughters the same assignment,
`⟦α β⟧ := λg. ⟦α⟧ g (⟦β⟧ g)` (6). Binding needs the sister of `Λᵢ` evaluated at shifted
assignments, which the rule never supplies. -/

/-- No denotation for `Λᵢ` binds under the standard rule (section 2.2): whatever `L` is,
`λg. L g (⟦α⟧ g)` sees `⟦α⟧` only at `g`, while binding needs `λg. λx. ⟦α⟧ g^{i→x}`. -/

/-! ### The reader applicative

The lift `ρ` (11) and application `⊛` (12) are the `pure` and `<*>` of the reader monad, and the
four laws of section 3.3 are its `LawfulApplicative` instance. Abstraction is the operation
`Λᵢ f := λg. λx. f g^{i→x}` (13), `lambdaAbsG`. -/

end Applicatives

/-! ### The flattener

A pronoun whose value is an intension has type `g → g → e` (18). The flattener `μ m := λg. m g g`
(19) is the reader monad's `joinM`. Section 4.3 states the monad laws with `ρ`, `⊛` and `μ`; they
hold in every lawful monad. -/

example {α : Type} (m : ReaderM (Assignment E) (ReaderM (Assignment E) α)) :
    joinM m = fun g => m g g := rfl

/-! ### Higher-order variables

For the analyses of section 4 an assignment values both individual variables and variables over
individual concepts. Here `G` is a type of assignments, `ind i` and `con i` look up variable `i`
of each sort, and `shift i x` and `shiftCon i n` are the shifted assignments `g^{i→x}`. -/

section HigherOrder

/-- The paycheck reading (Fig. 6): *Bill Λ₀ t₀ likes her₁*, with `her₁` anaphoric to an intension

/-- Binding reconstruction (Fig. 7): *[his₀ mom] Λ₁ every boy Λ₀ t₀ likes t₁*. The fronted
phrase's intension is stored at variable 1, the trace `t₁` is flattened by `μ`, and the sentence
says that every boy likes his own mom. -/

/-- Assignments that can store every intension exist only over a one-element domain. Storing
makes the lookup `con i` a surjection from `G` onto `G → E`, which Cantor's diagonal argument
rules out once `E` has two elements. This is why the laws above store only the intension a
derivation needs, and the difficulty section 5.1 cites for such assignments. -/

/-! ### Type-homogeneous assignments

Section 5 gives each type `r` its own assignments, `g_r := ℕ → r`, which is `Assignment r`. A
meaning that depends on assignments of two sorts lives in the composite of two reader
applicatives. -/

section TypeHomogeneous

/-- *…and buy the couch Λ₀ she₁ did t₀* (20): a pronoun over individuals and a trace over
properties give `λg. λh. h₀ g₁`. -/

      Functor.Comp (ReaderM (Assignment E)) (ReaderM (Assignment (E → Prop))) Prop).run =
      fun g h => h 0 (g 1) := rfl

/-- Meanings that depend on an assignment of individual concepts and then on an assignment of
individuals: the composite `G_{G_e e} ∘ G_e` of section 5.2. -/

  Functor.Comp (ReaderM (Assignment (Assignment E → E))) (ReaderM (Assignment E))

/-- The paycheck reading on type-homogeneous assignments (section 5.2): `her₁` reads an intension
from the outer assignment and evaluates it at the inner one, and `Λ₀` binds the subject's trace
in the inner layer. The meaning is `λg. λh. likes (g₁ h^{0→b}) b`, with no flattener. -/

  show likes (g 1 (h[0 ↦ b])) ((h[0 ↦ b]) 0) = _
  simp only [hg, Function.update_self]

end TypeHomogeneous

/-! ### Variable-free pronouns

A variable-free pronoun is the identity `λx. x` (Fig. 8), composed with the same `ρ` and `⊛` at
the entity type (section 6). -/

/-- *She left*. -/
example (left : E → Prop) : (pure left <*> (fun x => x) : ReaderM E Prop) = left := rfl

/-- *She saw her* in the variable-free applicative composed with itself is `λx. λy. saw y x`, and
uncurried it depends on a pair of individuals, as a meaning depends on an assignment. -/
example (saw : E → E → Prop) :
    (pure saw <*> Functor.Comp.mk (fun _ y => y) <*> Functor.Comp.mk (fun x _ => x) :
      Functor.Comp (ReaderM E) (ReaderM E) Prop).run = fun x y => saw y x := rfl

example (saw : E → E → Prop) :
    Function.uncurry (pure saw <*> Functor.Comp.mk (fun _ y => y) <*>
      Functor.Comp.mk (fun x _ => x) : Functor.Comp (ReaderM E) (ReaderM E) Prop).run =
      fun p => saw p.2 p.1 := rfl
