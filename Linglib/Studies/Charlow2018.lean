# [charlow-2018]: A Modular Theory of Pronouns and Binding

Simon Charlow (2018). "A modular theory of pronouns and binding."
Manuscript, Rutgers University. <https://lingbuzz.net/lingbuzz/003720>

## Thesis

The standard [heim-kratzer-1998] treatment of assignment-sensitivity
factors into two algebraic operations (§3.1, eqs 11–12):

* `ρ x := λg. x` — lift assignment-independent values
* `m ⊛ n := λg. m g (n g)` — assignment-friendly functional application

These form an **applicative functor** ([mcbride-paterson-2008]) for
`G a := g → a`, satisfying the four laws of §3.3 (Homomorphism,
Identity, Interchange, Composition). The modularization (i) keeps the
lexicon maximally simple — nothing is assignment-sensitive unless it
really is — and (ii) makes predicate abstraction `Λᵢ` categorematic
(eq. 13), eliminating H&K's syncategorematic rule.

Adding a **join** `μ m := λg. m g g` (eq. 19) upgrades the structure to
a monad (§4.3), enabling **higher-order variables** anaphoric to
*intensions* rather than *extensions* — yielding immediate analyses of
paycheck pronouns (Fig. 6) and binding reconstruction (Fig. 7) with the
unitary pronoun semantics `⟦proᵢ⟧ := λg. gᵢ`.

§3.3 shows applicative functors are *already implicit* in existing
semantic theory: Hamblin alternative semantics is the Set applicative
(eqs 14–15), and Shan & Barker's continuation-based composition is the
Cont applicative (eqs 16–17). Applicatives compose (Fig. 5) — unlike
monads (§4.3 end: `S ∘ G` is not monadic) — which §5 exploits: with
type-homogeneous assignments `gᵣ := ℕ → r` (§5.2), the composed
applicative `G_e ∘ G_{g_e→e}` handles paychecks *without* monads.
§6 plays us out with variable-free semantics ([jacobson-1999]): the
same ρ/⊛ with `Entity` as the environment type, where composing the VF
applicative with itself makes assignment-dependence "spring organically
into being."

## Organization (following the paper)

* **§3.1–3.2** — ρ/⊛, the four laws, H&K decomposition, categorematic Λᵢ
* **§3.3** — applicatives already in semantic theory: Set, Cont, composition
* **§4** — μ, higher-order variables: paychecks, binding reconstruction
* **§5** — typed assignments `gᵣ`; composed-applicative paychecks
* **§6** — variable-free semantics as Reader Entity
* **Bridges** — `Core`'s `DenotG` apparatus and `Reference/Binding`'s Reader monad

/-! ## §3.1–3.2 Getting modular: ρ and ⊛

Eqs (11)–(12): instead of treating all lexical values as trivially
assignment-dependent, invoke `ρ` to lift any `x` into a constant
function from assignments, and `⊛` for assignment-friendly functional
application on demand. The four applicative functor laws (§3.3 table)
hold definitionally for `G a := g → a`. -/

/-- ρ (eq. 11): lift a value into the Reader space — `ρ x := λg. x`. -/

def readerAp (f : E → A → B) (x : E → A) : E → B :=
  fun e => f e (x e)

end ReaderApplicative

/-! ### The ρ/⊛ decomposition of H&K's interpretation function

§3.1–3.2: the standard H&K interpretation function
`⟦α β⟧ := λg. ⟦α⟧ g (⟦β⟧ g)` decomposes into ρ (for trivially
assignment-dependent lexical entries: `⟦John⟧ = ρ(j)`) and ⊛ (for
binary branching). This decomposition is directly visible in linglib's
`interp` (`Composition/Tree.lean`): its binary case computes
`FA(⟦α⟧^g, ⟦β⟧^g)`, which is `applyG ⟦α⟧ ⟦β⟧` evaluated at `g`. -/

section HKDecomposition

variable {E W : Type} {σ τ : Ty}

/-- H&K's interpretation function `⟦α β⟧ = λg. ⟦α⟧ g (⟦β⟧ g)` is

    applyG f x = fun g => f g (x g) := rfl

/-- Non-pronominal entries in H&K are trivially assignment-dependent:

theorem hk_lexical_lift (d : Denot E W σ) :
    constDenot d = fun (_ : Core.Assignment E) => d := rfl

/-- Composing two ρ-lifted entries via ⊛ yields ρ of the composition. -/

    applyG (constDenot f) (constDenot x) = constDenot (f x) :=

end HKDecomposition

/-! ### Λᵢ: categorematic predicate abstraction

Eq. (13): `Λᵢ := λf. λg. λx. f g^{i→x}`. In H&K, predicate abstraction
is a syncategorematic rule; with ρ/⊛ there is no grammatical default
about how assignments get passed around, so Λᵢ becomes a *categorematic*
operation — linglib's `lambdaAbsG`. -/

/-! ## §3.3 Applicatives already in semantic theory

"Applicative functors can be factored out of a great deal of existing
semantic theory." Two examples, then the composition property. -/

/-! ### The Set applicative (eqs 14–15)

Hamblin alternative semantics restated as an applicative for sets
`S a := a → t`: `ρ x := {x}` and `m ⊛ n := {f x | f ∈ m, x ∈ n}`.
Operations are mathlib's `Set` `pure`/`<*>`; the application-form simp
lemmas serve consumers that treat `Set A = A → Prop`. The monadic
extension of this applicative — and why the *monad* matters for
exceptional scope — is [charlow-2020], formalized in
`Studies/Charlow2020.lean`. -/

section SetApplicative

/-- Set ρ (eq. 14): the singleton `{x}`. Mathlib's `Set` applicative

  ext c; simp only [mem_setAp, mem_setPure]; aesop

end SetApplicative

/-! ### The Cont applicative (eqs 16–17)

Shan & Barker's continuation-based composition is built on two
combinators (Lift/Scope) that directly instantiate the applicative
functor for continuations `Cᵣ a := (a → r) → r`. The operations are
definitionally `Cont.pure` and the `<*>` derived from
`Composition/Continuation.lean`'s monad instance. -/

section ContinuationApplicative

variable {R A B : Type}

/-- Eq. (16): `ρ x := λκ. κ x` = `Cont.pure`. -/
theorem cont_pure_eq (x : A) :
    (fun (κ : A → R) => κ x) = Cont.pure x := rfl

/-- Eq. (17): `m ⊛ n := λκ. m(λf. n(λx. κ(f x)))` = Cont `<*>`. -/
theorem cont_ap_eq (m : Cont R (A → B)) (n : Cont R A) :
    (fun (κ : B → R) => m (fun f => n (fun x => κ (f x)))) =
    Cont.bind m (fun f => Cont.map f n) := rfl

end ContinuationApplicative

/-! ### Composed applicatives (Fig. 5)

Given two applicative type constructors F and G, their composition
F ∘ G is applicative. For `Reader E₁ ∘ Reader E₂`:

```
ρ_{F∘G}(x) = λe₁ λe₂. x
(m ⊛_{F∘G} n)(e₁)(e₂) = m e₁ e₂ (n e₁ e₂)
```

This closure guarantees modularity: any two applicative-based analyses
combine without additional machinery. `G ∘ S` yields
assignment-dependent alternative sets; `S ∘ G` alternative
assignment-dependent meanings; `G ∘ G` doubly assignment-dependent
meanings (the §5 paycheck composite). Monads, by contrast, are NOT
closed under composition (§4.3 end: `S ∘ G` is not monadic). -/

end ComposedApplicatives

/-! ## §4 Getting higher-order: paychecks and reconstruction

Higher-order variables (eq. 18: `pro ::= g → e | g → pro`) are
anaphoric to *intensions* rather than *extensions*. The flattener μ
(eq. 19: `μ m := λg. m g g`) converts a higher-order meaning to a
garden-variety one. ρ, ⊛, and μ together form a monad (§4.3) — the
Reader monad.

The `Core.Assignment E = Nat → E` type can only store
entities, not intensions; §5.1 proposes type-homogeneous assignments
`gᵣ := ℕ → r` to fix this (next section). Here we show the paycheck
truth conditions using externally-provided intensions. -/

end Paycheck

/-! ### Binding reconstruction via higher-order trace + Λᵢ (Fig. 7)

"[His₁ mom]ⱼ, every boy₁ likes tⱼ." The bound pronoun *his₁* is inside
a fronted constituent syntactically *higher* than the binder *every
boy₁*. The analysis uses Λ₁ to abstract over the quantifier variable,
producing the reconstructed predicate `λx. likes(mom(x), x)` without
LF c-command — and without triggering Weak Crossover, since the
bound-into expression *originates* lower than the binder. -/

end BindingReconstruction

/-! ## §5 Stepping back, to applicatives: typed assignments

§5.1–5.2: type-homogeneous assignments `gᵣ := ℕ → r` avoid the
inconsistency worries of a single polymorphic assignment type (Muskens
1995). Each type `r` gets its own assignment sort: `gₑ` maps indices
to individuals, `g_{gₑ→e}` to individual concepts. The composed
applicative `Gₑ ∘ G_{gₑ→e}` then handles paycheck pronouns *without*
monadic μ: the paycheck pronoun reads an intension from the
intension-assignment and evaluates it at the entity-assignment.
"We needn't exploit the extra power of monads to treat paychecks and
reconstruction; the only price is needing multiple assignments to
extract propositional content from certain utterances." -/

section TypedAssignments

variable {E : Type}

/-- Type-homogeneous assignment over carrier `r` (§5.2: `gᵣ := ℕ → r`).

composition where `r` ranges over both entity and intension carriers

abbrev TypedAssignment (r : Type) := Core.Assignment r

/-- Self-contained paycheck derivation via composed `Gₑ ∘ G_{gₑ→e}`.

The intension-assignment `gᵢ` maps index `j` to the intension
`λh. mom(h 0)` (= "his₀ mom"). The entity-assignment `gₑ` maps index 0
to Bill. The paycheck pronoun `herⱼ` reads from `gᵢ` and evaluates at
`gₑ`, yielding `mom(bill)` — "virtually identical to what we
monadically derived in Figure 6, but depending on two assignments
rather than one." -/

/-! ## §6 A bit of variable-free semantics to play us out

[jacobson-1999]'s variable-free semantics treats pronouns as identity
functions `⟦she⟧ := λx. x` (type `e → e`). The composition apparatus
is structurally identical to the assignment-sensitive version — ρ and
⊛ with `Entity` as the environment type instead of assignments
("we've only replaced g-dependent e's with e-dependent e's").

The striking observation: composing the VF applicative with itself
(`Reader E ∘ Reader E`) yields two-pronoun readings where the pronouns
resolve independently — uncurrying the result produces
assignment-dependence "organically." -/
