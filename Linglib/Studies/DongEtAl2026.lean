# Dong et al. (2026): Value of Information: A Framework for Human–Agent Communication

This file formalizes the clarify-or-commit policy of [dong-etal-2026]. An agent holds a belief
`b` over a user's latent intent `θ`, may commit to an action `a` of utility `U(θ, a)`, or may
ask a closed-ended question `q` whose answer `y` it predicts by an answer model `p(y ∣ q, θ)`
and which costs the user `c`. The expected utility of committing, (1), is an integral against
the belief, and the value of acting now, (2), is its best value, `decisionValue`. The value of a
question, (3), is the answer-marginal expectation of the value of the posterior belief, so the
value of information, (4), `VoI(q) = Vpost(b, q) − V(b)`, is the value of information of the
question as an experiment under the decision value, the notion the paper takes from
[raiffa-schlaifer-1961], and the net value, (5), subtracts the cost. The agent clarifies with a
question of positive net value and commits when none has one. Information cannot have negative
value, `voi_nonneg`, so an uninformative question is never asked, `not_clarifies_of_const`;
scaling the stakes scales the value of information, `voi_smul`, so a question worth asking at
low stakes is worth asking at higher stakes, `clarifies_smul`, and a costlier question is asked
less, `clarifies_of_le`. Appendix A shows this risk awareness on its 20 Questions task, where a
correct animal guess is worth `1` and a correct diagnosis `10`; `appendixA` reproduces the
contrast on a two-candidate task with a yes/no question of reliability `r`, whose value of
information is `r − 1/2` by `voi_reliability`.

## Implementation notes

The belief is a probability measure on intents and each question an answer kernel, so (1) to (4)
are integrals, posteriors and values of information of the library, and the clarify-or-commit
decision is the only new object. The policy's choice among the questions of positive net value,
the sequential loop of Algorithm 1 with its clarification budget and linear cost `T · c`, and the
language-model estimates of belief and answer distributions of §4.2 are not represented: the
theorems concern the decision at one turn, at a fixed belief. Stakes are a scalar on the utility.
The two-candidate task and the reliability `27/50` are this file's illustration, not the paper's.
