# Lassiter (2015): Epistemic comparison, models of uncertainty, and the disjunction puzzle

Lassiter traces the disjunction puzzle, that *φ is as likely as ψ* and *φ is as likely as χ*
entail *φ is as likely as ψ or χ* under Kratzer's comparative possibility, to Lewis's lift, by
which the likelihood of a disjunction is that of its likeliest disjunct. Kratzer's revised lift
keeps the puzzle for disjoint alternatives, and Holliday and Icard's m-lifting avoids it but,
under Kratzer's *must*, refutes Yalcin's V6. A probability scale refutes the puzzle; symmetric
fuzzy measures refute it too but also refute V13, which qualitative additivity restores. Three
bridges from Kratzer's *must* to a probabilistic *likely* each fail, and the paper ends with
three probabilistic replacements for the auxiliaries.

## Main results

* `disjunction_puzzle`, `lottery_collapse`: §1.1, the puzzle and its lottery iteration.
* `revised_escapes_collapse`, `revised_disjoint_puzzle`, `revised_countermodel_overlap`: §1.4.
* `mLift_refutes_V6`: §1.5, the m-lifting against (35), which the l-lifting validates under the
  same *must* (`Yalcin2010.kratzer_V6`).
* `prob_refutes_rightUnion`, `prob_rightUnion_of_half`, `lottery_bound`: §2.1.
* `fuzzy_refutes_V13`, `QualAddMeasure.eq_zero_of_union_le`: §2.2, (48) and (49).
* `bridge1_disjoint_puzzle`, `bridge1_thin_margin`, `bridge2_refutes_V6`, `bridge3_refutes_V6`:
  §3.
* `moreLikely_might`, `weak_refutes_moreLikely_might`: §4.

## Implementation notes

* Kratzer's *must* is human necessity over the empty base, as in Yalcin's study
  (`Yalcin2010.must`).
* The world-ordering countermodels share three worlds, the first alone best, with masses `0.4`,
  `0.3`, `0.3`; BR3 holds there by Holliday and Icard's footnote-13 lemma.
* Probabilities are mathlib probability measures on a discrete space, compared on their real
  values; the models of §2.1 and §3 are finite sums of Dirac measures.
* The strong and weak auxiliaries are the positive forms of the probability scale,
  `Degree.Comparison.ge.over` for *must* and `Degree.Comparison.gt.over` for *might*, with
  thresholds `1` and `θ < 1`.
* The ratio-modifier argument of §2.2 and the open problems of §4 are recorded as examples
  only.
