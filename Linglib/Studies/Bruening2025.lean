# Bruening 2025: selectional violations in coordination

Bruening replies to Patejuk and Przepiórkowski's critique of Bruening and Al Khalaf. He grants
that coordinated arguments need not match in category, so the revised grammar keeps the 2020
selector's requirements, c-selection checked against every conjunct and S-features checked once
against the conjunct next to the selector, without the requirement that conjuncts share a
category (§§5.2–5.4). He maintains that the two selectional violations are real, limited and
linear, as three surveys bear out, and replaces the 2020 account of the adverbial one by negative
c-selectional features, which the next item merged checks off (§5.8). The examples are the rows of
`Data/Examples/Bruening2025` and the survey results are `Data/Experiments/Bruening2025`.

## Main definitions

* `Selected`, `Site`: what the features name and what a coordination merges with.
* `CFeature`, `Modifier`: a modifier's category and c-selectional feature.
* `MergesWith`: when a coordination of modifiers can merge with its site.

## Main results

* `selection_rows`: complements of one category and meaning differ in acceptability from verb
  to verb, so c-selection is not semantic selection.
* `argument_rows`, `argument_rows_licensed`, `argument_rows_2020`: the revision decides the
  coordinated arguments, and it parts from the 2020 grammar exactly on coordinations of selected
  phrases of different categories, in both papers' data.
* `cp_subjects`, `exp1b_persisting`: speaker variation as the absence or the persistence of
  S-features.
* `mergesWith_iff_nominalCoordination`: on prenominal modifiers the analysis agrees with the 2020
  one, with no null head.
* `adverb_mergesWith_maximal`: an underspecified adverb merges with a maximal noun phrase and not
  with a nonmaximal one, the distinction the analysis needs.
* `mergesWith_cmpr_iff`: it extends to comparatives, where an adverb may also only be the
  conjunct away from the comparative.
* `modifier_rows`, `stacked_rows`, `prenominal_rows_2020`: it decides the examples and the 2020
  paper's prenominal ones.
* `exp1a_predictions`, `exp2_predictions`, `exp1b_predictions`: the survey conditions the
  analysis admits, which are the ones rated higher (Tables 2, 4, 6).

## Implementation notes

* S-features are present or absent. The superset requirement of §5.3 matters only for
  *strengthen* and *withdraw* (§5.6), which the paper excludes semantically (`semantic_rows`).
* The positive features of *-ly* adverbs are left open by the paper beyond excluding nouns; they
  are given verbs and adjectives here, and no theorem uses more than that they exclude nouns.
* Modifiers merge with a site, a position of a tree or a degree head, and whether the site is a
  maximal projection is read off its tree (`Syntax.IsMaximalCategory`): the noun of (104) is
  projected further by its mother, while *so soon* adjoins to the maximal noun phrase *a visit*
  (p. 479). The features name maximal and nonmaximal projections (`Selected`); a modifier is a
  maximal phrase, since it is no head.
* Short displacement as a degree phrase ((105)) is not formalized.
