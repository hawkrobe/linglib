# Gasparri (2025): Bare Singular Names and Genericity

This file formalizes [gasparri-2025]'s reply to the argument that bare singular names, unlike the
definite singulars predicativism equates them with ([matushansky-2008], [fara-2015]), never take
generic readings ([delgado-2024]). The paper's data show that they do, in simple generics as well
as under quantificational adverbs, though more grudgingly than common-noun definites: out of the
blue a bare name resists the generic reading, and a naming-convention context, a locative, a
modifier or binding recovers it. Kind-level generics are the one case that stays closed to bare
names and open to quoted ones, a gap common nouns share.

The rows are the paper's judgments and the theorems the generalizations it draws from them:
`recalcitrance` against parity with definite singulars, `bareName_simple_generic` against the
categorical ban. The paper's theoretical point, that a generic use calls for predicative content,
is `referentialist_generic_is_token`: a referential name shifted to its identity property
([partee-1987]) and fed to the generic operator yields nothing but the token reading, so the shift
a referentialist needs must introduce the naming predicate itself.

## Implementation notes

* The generic operator is *most* over the restrictor, the proportional reading the paper's
  genericity diagnostics presuppose; the paper itself stays neutral on the semantics of Gen.
* A sentence the paper marks `??` without listing a reading is recorded with a questionable
  generic reading, the reading at issue; a reading the paper does not list is absent.
