# Kratzer (1989): An Investigation of the Lumps of Thought

This file formalizes [kratzer-1989]'s premise semantics for counterfactuals over situations and
its argument that counterfactual reasoning needs the lumping relation between propositions.
Situations are the elements of a type with a parthood preorder, propositions are sets of
situations, and the worlds are the maximal situations. A proposition lumps another in a world
when it is true there and every part of the world in which it is true is one in which the other
is true too (§2). This is neither logical nor material implication, and a possible-worlds
semantics, whose worlds have no parts, cannot tell it from the latter.

The analysis of §4.2 adds true propositions to the antecedent of a counterfactual while
preserving consistency. Taken at face value it predicts (§4.3) that if Paula weren't buying a
pound of apples, the Atlantic Ocean might be drying up, since the true disjunction that Paula
is buying apples or the Atlantic is drying up can be added consistently to the antecedent and,
with it, yields the consequent. The repair of §4.4 is that a proposition brings along
everything it lumps. In a world where the Atlantic is not drying up, every situation where the
disjunction holds is one where Paula is buying apples, so the disjunction lumps the first
disjunct, which contradicts the antecedent. The spurious *might*-counterfactual is blocked, and
the proposition that the Atlantic is not drying up survives and settles the question. The
formal definitions of §4.6 build this into the crucial set, the family of premise sets over
which *would* and *might* quantify.

## Main definitions

* `Kratzer1989.Lumps`: lumping in a situation.
* `Kratzer1989.Follows`, `Kratzer1989.IsConsistent`, `Kratzer1989.IsCompatible`: logical
  consequence, consistency, and compatibility, which quantify over worlds only.
* `Kratzer1989.Would`, `Kratzer1989.Might`: the counterfactuals over a family of premise sets.
* `Kratzer1989.consistentPremiseSets`: the premise sets of the analysis of §4.2.
* `Kratzer1989.IsCrucial`: membership in the crucial set of §4.6.

## Main results

* `Kratzer1989.Lumps.iff_of_isMin`: at a situation without proper parts lumping is joint truth.
* `Kratzer1989.closedUnderConsequence_iff`: strong closure under logical consequence is closure
  of the whole set.
* `Kratzer1989.might_iff_not_would_compl`: *might* is the dual of *would*.
* `Kratzer1989.might_consistentPremiseSets_atlantic`: the analysis of §4.2 validates (10a).
* `Kratzer1989.not_might_crucialSet_atlantic`: the crucial set blocks it.

## Implementation notes

The set `F` of propositions relevant at a world is a parameter. The paper requires its members
to be true in the world and persistent, among further conditions left open, and says the two
closure conditions must be relativized to it; `ClosedUnderLumping` and `ClosedUnderConsequence`
are stated relative to `F`.

The model has three worlds, the actual one, one where only Paula's purchase differs, and one
where the Atlantic dries, and two parts of the actual world, one supporting only the purchase
and one supporting only the Atlantic's calm. The second is what keeps the calm from lumping the
purchase. The relevant propositions are (9a), (9b), and (9d); the moon disjunction (9e) runs in
parallel.

## TODO

Closure under logical consequence is idle in the Paula example. The paper motivates it with the
King Ludwig example of §5.2, which needs the non-accidental generalizations of §5.
