# Degen and Tonhauser (2022): Are there factive predicates? An empirical investigation

A clause-embedding predicate is factive, on Kiparsky and Kiparsky's definition, when the content
of its complement is presupposed, and on Gazdar's when that content is presupposed and entailed.
Degen and Tonhauser test both definitions on twenty English predicates, diagnosing presupposition
by projection and entailment by inference and by contradictoriness, each under a gradient and a
categorical response task. On the first definition the canonically factive predicates should
project categorically more than the rest, and they do not: the optionally factive *acknowledge*,
*hear* and *inform* project at least as much as *reveal*. On the second, every complement
projects, so the factive predicates are those with entailed complements, and under every
diagnostic and task these are none, or not categorically more projective than the rest.

## Main statements

* `not_exists_threshold`: no threshold on the certainty ratings picks out the canonically factive
  predicates, under either task.
* `factive_eq_empty_or_not_separates`: the predicates whose complement is both projective and
  entailed are none, or not categorically more projective than the rest.
* `isFactive_iff`: the predicates the English lexicon marks factive are the canonically factive
  ones.

## Implementation notes

* A class is categorically more projective when every member's mean certainty rating exceeds
  every non-member's, `Separates`; over finitely many predicates this is a threshold on the
  ratings.
* Projective and entailed are the paper's verdicts from its regressions: a complement projects
  when its ratings are distinguished from the main-clause controls', and is entailed when they
  are not distinguished from those of the controls with entailed content.
