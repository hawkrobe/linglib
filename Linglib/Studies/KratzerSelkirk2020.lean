# Kratzer and Selkirk (2020): Deconstructing Information Structure

This file formalizes the paper's two-feature decomposition of information structure and
its semantics in Rooth's alternatives framework. The privative feature [FoC] introduces
alternatives, setting the alternatives value of a constituent of type τ to the whole domain
of that type, and imposes no discourse requirement of its own; the squiggle operator that
must c-command it requires the constituent to represent a contrast with each of a set of
salient discourse referents, which must be among the alternatives and differ from the
ordinary value, and then consumes the alternatives, collapsing them to the ordinary value.
The feature [G] presupposes Givenness, that the alternatives value is the singleton of a
salient discourse referent, and leaves both values unchanged; the requirement is
use-conditional, like the German particles *ja* and *doch*. Two consequences follow. No
constituent can bear both features, since no domain is a singleton, and a constituent
containing a focus can be Given only if an operator inside it has consumed the alternatives,
which is what licenses second-occurrence focus under *only*. Newness is no feature at all,
so the paper's footnote on Hausa rereads the in situ and ex situ answers of
[hartmann-zimmermann-2007] as unmarked newness and [FoC].

## Implementation notes

The paper's Givenness is the substrate's `WithAlternatives.Given`, and its *only* is the
library's `Focus.onlyVia` at the salient contrast set, so the paper's indirect association
through two occurrences of the contextual variable is a fact about the substrate. The
squiggle operator is bundled with proofs of the first two contrast conditions of (49); the
third, which prevents overfocusing by comparing [FoC]/[G]-variants, is not formalized. The
prosodic spell-out of the features in English (§6–§7) is prose.

/-! ### Hausa (footnote 21)

The paper does not conclude with [hartmann-zimmermann-2007] that information focus is
realised both in situ and ex situ in Hausa, since accommodated contrasts were not controlled
for: on its inventory mere newness is no focus, so ex situ realises [FoC] and in situ is
unmarked, in line with the corpus tendency the footnote cites, most information focus in
situ and most selective, contrastive, and corrective focus ex situ. -/

/-- The paper's inventory over the pragmatic uses of [hartmann-zimmermann-2007]: the
contrastive family is [FoC], new information is unmarked. -/
def IsFoCus : Focus.Use → Prop
  | .newInfo => False
  | _ => True

instance (u : Focus.Use) : Decidable (IsFoCus u) := by
  cases u <;> simp [IsFoCus] <;> infer_instance

/-- The rereading of Hausa: ex situ realisation iff [FoC]. -/
def KSHausaReading (u : HartmannZimmermann2007.FocusUtterance) : Prop :=
  u.cfg.strategy = .exSitu ↔ IsFoCus u.pragType

instance (u : HartmannZimmermann2007.FocusUtterance) : Decidable (KSHausaReading u) :=
  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (_ ↔ _))

/-- The two accounts part on the cells the accommodation caveat targets: the ex situ
new-information answer and the in situ corrective answer of the Hausa study both violate
the rereading. -/
