# Zaenen, Maling and Thráinsson (1985): Case and grammatical functions

This file formalizes [zaenen-maling-thrainsson-1985]'s account of Icelandic case. A verb's
arguments are thematic roles, some of which the verb marks with an idiosyncratic case
(`Arg`); the association principles map the roles onto the grammatical functions SUBJ, OBJ
and 2OBJ, agents to SUBJ and case-marked themes to the lowest function available, and the
functions are the linear positions (`associations`). The passive is an operation on
functions, not on cases or roles: SUBJ is suppressed and OBJ becomes SUBJ (`GF.passive`).
Only afterwards does default case marking give the highest function without a case the
nominative and the next the accusative (`surfaceCase`), so idiosyncratic case survives the
passive (`surfaceCase_lexical`) while the accusative of an object does not.

The consequences the paper draws are theorems over the fragment. Every case array of
`Fragments.Icelandic.Verbs` that the paper discusses is derived from its thematic structure
(`fragment_cases`). A dative subject leaves the nominative to its object (*þykja*), and the
passive of *hjálpa* has a dative subject and no nominative at all. A dative–accusative verb
gives its theme and its goal either function, so *gefa* has two passives, the dative subject
with a nominative retained object and the nominative subject with a dative object
(`gefa_passives`), where the other ditransitives have one (`lofa_passive`); and a genitive
theme passivizes exactly when it is the only object, since with a goal beside it the lowest
function is 2OBJ (`oska_passive`). The seven subjecthood tests of §2 target SUBJ, whatever
its case: each of the paper's judgments on raising, reflexivization, inversion, extraction,
postposing, ellipsis and control is acceptable exactly when the argument tested is assigned
SUBJ (`rows_subject`), and each attested case array is one the principles derive
(`rows_cases`).

## Implementation notes

The paper names the roles Agent, Theme, Goal and Source; the dative and accusative
subjects of *þykja*, *finnast*, *sakna* and *vanta* it calls oblique subjects without a
role, and `experiencer` is the label under which principle (61a) assigns them their
function. Principle (61a) is read as assigning the first role SUBJ and leaving the object
functions to the remaining roles in either order unless (61c) fixes them, which is the
paper's dual association for *gefa* and keeps the nominative theme of *þykja* an object,
as the tests of §2 require. A third function without idiosyncratic case receives no default
case; the paper's ditransitives never present one.
