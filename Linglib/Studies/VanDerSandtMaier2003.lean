# van der Sandt and Maier (2003): Denials in Discourse

This file formalizes [van-der-sandt-maier-2003]'s account of denial as a non-monotonic
correction operation on the discourse record, independent of the semantic operator of
negation, against [horn-1985]'s metalinguistic negation. A denial leaves a negated star
condition in the discourse representation, and reverse anaphora moves the material objected
to under that negation, (2); removing the whole contribution of the previous utterance fails on
[strawson-1952]'s pushed man, (3), on multiple presuppositions, (4), and on an acknowledged
part of the utterance, (5). Layered DRT distributes the information an utterance conveys over
layers, each condition labelled with the Frege, presupposition or implicature layer of the
sentence it comes from, `Label`, `Condition`, `LDRS`, and the content of a set of layers ignores
every other, `content`, (13). Directed reverse anaphora then targets the offensive layers alone,
a smallest set of layers whose content is inconsistent with the Frege content of the correction,
`IsOff`, (18), and moves their conditions under the negation of the denial, `directedRA`, (19):
the resulting record keeps the conditions of every other layer and entails the negation of the
offensive content, `content_directedRA`, so the offensive content is retracted,
`disjoint_content_directedRA`, while assertion, the merge of representations, only strengthens
the record, `content_append_subset`. The worked examples are the implicature denials of the
possibly right Pope, (20), `popeOff`, `pope_content_directedRA`, and of the lady who is a wife,
(21), `ladyOff`, `lady_nice_survives`.

## Implementation notes

The paper interprets layered representations by partial embeddings and closes open layers
into singular propositions through the utterance context, (15) and (16); here a condition
carries the proposition it expresses once anchored, so an LDRS is a list of labelled
propositions and the L-content is the intersection of the conditions bearing a label in L.
Offensiveness is minimal disjointness, which need not be unique. The finer targeting of
footnote 10, moving only the smallest inconsistent sub-DRS, is not formalized: at the
granularity of layers the denial of one of two presuppositions of the same sentence, (4),
retracts both, `kingQuit_quit_lost`, the limitation the paper records there. The examples are
the rows of `Data.Examples.VanDerSandtMaier2003`.
