# Thomas (2026): A Probabilistic, Question-Based Approach to Additivity

This file formalizes [thomas-2026]'s felicity conditions for additive *too*, which unify its
canonical use, a second answer to a salient question, (2), with the argument-building use in
which the antecedent and the prejacent together argue for a conclusion, (1) and (18). The
account is stated in an inquisitive question semantics with a listener's probability measure
over worlds. A proposition is relevant to a question if it shifts the probability of one of the
question's alternatives, (61); it answers the question if it raises the probability of some
resolution, a nonempty set of alternatives, by a factor exceeding that of every resolution not
entailed by it, (62); and one proposition evidences a resolution more strongly than another if
it gives it the higher conditional probability, (63). *Too* requires an antecedent proposition
and a question relevant to the discourse such that the antecedent answers the question, the
conjunction of antecedent and prejacent answers it and evidences its resolution more strongly
than the antecedent alone, and the prejacent neither entails that resolution nor could be
weakened without weakening the evidence, (64).

The definitions are `Relevant`, `IsResolutionOf`, `Answers`, `EvidencesMore` and
`TooFelicitous`. Answering needs a positive prior on the evidence, `IsResolutionOf.ne_zero`,
and trivial evidence answers nothing, `not_answers_univ`; the resolutions a proposition
evidences are nested, `IsResolutionOf.subset_or_subset`, and a singleton resolution makes the
proposition relevant to the question, `IsResolutionOf.relevant`. The paper's arguments for
its examples reduce to three patterns: an antecedent entailing a resolution gives it
probability one, `cond_eq_one_of_subset`, so a conjunction entailing what the antecedent
leaves uncertain evidences it more strongly, `evidencesMore_of_subset`, as in (68); a
prejacent that leaves every resolution's conditional probability unchanged fails the
conjunction condition, `not_tooFelicitous_of_cond_eq`, as in (25) and (72); a prejacent
entailing the evidenced resolution fails the first prejacent condition,
`not_tooFelicitous_of_subset`, as in (11) and (29); and evidence raising every candidate
resolution by the same factor answers no question, `not_answers_of_impact_eq`, as in (71).

## Implementation notes

The listener's belief state is a probability measure, and conditioning is mathlib's
`ProbabilityTheory.cond`, so the paper's statements hold at every prior. The resolution
evidenced by a proposition, which the paper calls unique, is only unique up to nesting: the
dominance clause of (62) waives resolutions containing the candidate, so the felicity
condition quantifies existentially over the resolution that the conjunction evidences and
the prejacent conditions constrain. Bayesian belief revision through a speaker model, (57)–(59),
is not formalized: the antecedent is the proposition the listener learns. The examples are the
rows of `Data.Examples.Thomas2026`, with the paper's diagnosis of each *too* recorded as a
feature.

/-! ### Relevance and answerhood (section 5.1.3) -/

/-- Relevance (61a): a question is relevant to a question if some alternative of the first
shifts the probability of some alternative of the second. -/
def Relevant (R S : Question W) : Prop :=
  ∃ A ∈ alt R, ∃ A' ∈ alt S, μ[A' | A] ≠ μ A'

/-- The impact of a proposition on a proposition: the factor by which learning the first
raises the probability of the second. -/
noncomputable def impact (R A : Set W) : ℝ≥0∞ := μ[A | R] / μ A

/-- Answerhood (62): a nonempty set of alternatives is the resolution of a question evidenced
by a proposition when the proposition raises the probability of its conjunction and impacts
it more than the conjunction of any set of alternatives not entailed by it. -/

/-! ### The felicity conditions of *too* (section 5.2) -/

/-- (64a)–(64c): the antecedent answers the question; the conjunction of antecedent and
prejacent answers it and evidences its resolution more strongly than the antecedent; the
prejacent does not entail that resolution, and any weaker prejacent would evidence it less
strongly. -/
