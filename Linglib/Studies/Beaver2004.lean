# Beaver (2004): The Optimization of Discourse Anaphora

Centering's BFP algorithm ([brennan-friedman-pollard-1987]) is restated as six
ranked OT constraints, COT (4): AGREE > DISJOINT > PRO-TOP > FAM-DEF >
COHERE > ALIGN. Three of the six are Centering primitives this library already
carries — PRO-TOP is Rule 1 without its if-clause (`CbPronominalized`), COHERE
and ALIGN are the transition-classification tests (`cb`, `cp`) — so on those
the correspondence with BFP holds by construction. The paper's Theorem (20)
says COT and BFP resolve anaphora identically; its core is table (19), which
matches COHERE/ALIGN violation patterns to the transition ranking, proved here
in general. Because COT constraints are rerankable, demoting PRO-TOP below
FAM-DEF (§4.1) recovers the coreferential reading of (2c) that BFP wrongly
filters out.

## Main statements

* `cot_iff_bfp`: table (19) — for candidates tied on the four higher-ranked
  constraints, the COT profile comparison is the BFP transition preference.
* `d2_canonical_picks_two_marys`, `d2_demoted_picks_bound`: the §4.1
  reranking flips (2c) from the two-Marys reading to the coreferential one.
* `cohere_factors_through_cb`, `align_factors_through_cb_and_cp`: the reused
  constraints see a candidate only through `cb` (and `cp`).

/-- A COT candidate: a fully-resolved utterance (pronouns bound to entities)
plus verdict flags for the three constraints whose inputs the `Utterance`
substrate does not carry — φ-features (AGREE), predicate-argument structure
(DISJOINT) and definiteness/familiarity (FAM-DEF). -/
