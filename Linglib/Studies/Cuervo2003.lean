# Cuervo (2003): Datives at Large

This file formalizes the central claim of [cuervo-2003]: dative arguments have structural
meanings. A dative is licensed by an applicative head, and what it means is read off where that
head merges in the event structure, the chain of [cuervo-2003]'s flavors of v
(`Minimalist.LittleV`); the site is `Minimalist.ApplSite`. Table (28) distinguishes three
positions. Below every verbal head, the
applicative takes the theme DP as its complement and relates the dative to an individual, as a
recipient, a source or a possessor according to the verb and to pragmatics: the low applicative,
the double object construction of Chapter 2. Between two heads, it takes the lower vP, a result
state, as its complement and is itself the complement of the dynamic head above, so the dative
participates in two events, external to the state and internal to the change or activity: the
affected applicative of Chapter 3, the addition to Pylkkänen's typology. Above every head, it
takes the whole vP and relates the dative to the event: the high applicative of Chapter 4, an
experiencer over a state or a change and a benefactive or malefactive, the ethical dative, over an
activity. Every cell of table (40) is a value of `meaning`.

Three restrictions turn the geometry into predictions. A low applicative needs the theme as the
complement of the root, which it is in a simple structure whose root licenses an object, but not
in a complex one, where the theme is the specifier of the lower vP, nor in a predicational state;
so the double object construction is structurally incompatible with causatives and inchoatives
(§3.1, §3.2.3), and Baker's gap, the absence of the construction with unaccusatives, reduces to
simple verbs of change, with which Spanish has it (*A Gabi le llegaron dos cartas*). English lacks
the affected applicative and every high one, and has the low applicative TO under activities
alone, which is why its causatives, inchoatives and unaccusatives take no dative at all. A high
applicative requires an animate dative, so an inanimate dative with an inchoative is affected and
nothing else, while an animate one is ambiguous between the affected reading and the
unintentional-responsibility reading of a high applicative over vGO (§4.2.3). And the Spanish
high applicative over an activity is defective: it is spelled out by a clitic and projects no
specifier, so an unergative takes a dative clitic and no dative DP (§4.3.2).

## Main definitions

* `Meaning`, `meaning`: table (40), the meaning of a dative at a `Minimalist.ApplSite`.
* `Predicate`, `Predicate.ThemeIsRootComplement`: a verb's use with its event structure.
* `Inventory`, `spanish`, `english`, `Inventory.Licenses`, `meanings`: which datives a language's
  applicative heads license and what they mean.

## Main results

* `not_licenses_low_of_biEventive`, `english_not_licenses_of_biEventive`,
  `english_not_licenses_change`: no double object construction with a complex structure; no
  dative at all in English causatives, inchoatives and simple verbs of change.
* `unergative_clitic_only`: the only dative of a Spanish unergative is an animate ethical clitic.
* `inchoative_meanings`: an animate dative with an inchoative is affected or experiencer, an
  inanimate one affected alone.
* `rows`: every example's acceptability and reported meaning are as `meanings` predicts.

## Implementation notes

The merge site of the applicative and the three types of table (28) are the substrate's
`Minimalist.ApplSite`, a cut of the little-v chain; the empty affected-under-state cell of table
(40) is its `ApplSite.not_affected_of_state`. Dative case, clitic doubling and the movement of the
dative to the subject position of unaccusatives (§2.0.5, §3.2.2.1) are not represented, nor are
the sub-types of low applicative beyond the relation read, the resultatives and particles of
§3.3, or the defective applicatives of other languages. The low relation is the verb's, as the
paper takes it to be fixed by the verb's meaning and by pragmatics. Italian is left out, since
the paper attests its double object construction with *arrivare* alone.
