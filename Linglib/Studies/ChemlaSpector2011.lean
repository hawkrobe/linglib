# Chemla and Spector (2011): Experimental evidence for embedded scalar implicatures

Chemla and Spector argue, against Geurts and Pouscoulous, that scalar inferences computed in
embedded position are detectable. A graded truth-value judgment rates a picture higher when it
satisfies more of a sentence's available readings (§3.2), and the readings a theory makes
available are those its mechanism can derive. A restricted globalist computes the inference at
the speech-act level only, a localist anywhere, and an unrestricted globalist wherever the
result entails the literal reading. Under a universal the local reading entails the literal
one, so Experiment 1 separates only the restricted globalist; under *exactly one* it does not,
so Experiment 2 separates the localist from both globalists.

## Main results

* `exp1_monotone`: in Experiment 1 the ratings rise with the number of true readings.
* `restrictedGlobalist_strong_eq_weak`, `localist_weak_ssubset_strong`: only the localist
  predicts the gap between STRONG and WEAK.
* `unrestrictedGlobalist_local_eq_false`, `exp2_false_lt_local`: the globalists predict LOCAL to
  be rated like FALSE, and it is rated far above.
* `local_isReinforceable`: the local reading passes Sadock's reinforceability diagnostic.
* `de_qLocal_lt_both`, `de_agrees_with_geurts_pouscoulous`: the marginal local reading under
  negation is rated far below the baseline, in line with the fourth experiment of Geurts and
  Pouscoulous (`GeurtsPouscoulous2009.rows_construals_conflict`).

## Implementation notes

* The unrestricted globalist's reach is the semantic condition that a reading entail the
  literal one, so its environment-dependence is derived rather than tabulated.
* Section and figure numbers follow the preprint of December 2010 on the Semantics Archive.
