# Bale (2008): A universal scale of comparison

A gradable adjective orders a comparison class by a quasi-order, such as *has as much beauty as*.
Its classes of equivalent members form the primary scale, and each member is sent to the
universal degree of its class: one plus the number of classes below it, over the number of
classes. The comparative compares universal degrees whatever the two scales, so one
interpretation serves indirect comparisons (*Betty is more beautiful than Heather is
intelligent*) and direct ones (*Seymour is taller than he is wide*). A comparison is direct when
the comparison class contains the measurements in inches up to a bound and everyone is as tall,
or as wide, as exactly one of them: both primary scales are then the measurement system, and
universal degrees compare as measurements do. A for-clause restricts the comparison class to
men and drops the measurements, so Seymour, short and very wide, is taller than he is wide but
not taller for a man than he is wide for a man.

## Main statements

* `indirect_comparison`: Betty is more beautiful than Heather is intelligent, but not more
  intelligent than Evelin is beautiful.
* `direct_comparison`: with the measurements up to a common bound in the comparison class,
  comparing universal degrees is comparing measurements.
* `for_a_man`: under the same quasi-orders, Seymour is taller than he is wide but not taller for
  a man than he is wide for a man.
* `rows_truth`: the sentences the paper evaluates take the truth values it reports.

## Implementation notes

* Universal degrees are `Degree.universalDegree`: an adjective's quasi-order is given by a
  measure into a linear order, and a comparison class by a finite set, which restricts the
  quasi-order as Klein's comparison classes do.
* The comparative is Kennedy's, as in the paper: MORE applied to the greatest degree the
  than-clause reaches is `Degree.MaxComparative .gt` over the two measures (`more_iff`), stated as
  the point comparison `μ ⁻¹' Set.Ioi n`.
* Universal degrees are rationals: the paper's universal scale is the rationals from zero to one.
* Measurements are individuals `.inr n` of `n` inches, bounded by the comparison class; heights
  and widths are in inches as printed, and the committee's rankings count from the bottom.

/-- A member lowest on one scale is not more ADJ₁ than a member highest on another is ADJ₂, since
its degree is at most one over the number of classes and the standard's is one. -/
