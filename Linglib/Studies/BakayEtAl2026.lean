# Bakay, Akkuş and Dillon (2026): hierarchical relations in antecedent retrieval

This file formalizes the structural claims behind three visual-world experiments on the Turkish
reciprocal *birbirleri*, which must be bound by a c-commanding antecedent in its own clause.
Bakay, Akkuş and Dillon ask whether c-command between the noun phrases of one clause guides
antecedent retrieval, and they deconfound it from clause-mateness, case, subjecthood and linear
order. The target, an embedded subject or an indirect object, and the distractor, a possessor
inside the subject or inside an adjunct noun phrase or the complement of a postposition, share
the reciprocal's clause and case. The four embedded structures are phrase-structure trees here,
and Principle A over their clause configuration makes the embedded subject and an indirect
object available and the matrix subject and every distractor unavailable (`available_iff`), as
the paper's coindexations record (`rows_available`).

The paper weighs two ways retrieval could use the relation. On the cue-based account of Lewis
and Vasishth the reciprocal cues features stored with each candidate, and c-command enters
through Kush's `local` feature, carried by the noun phrases attached to the spine of the current
clause or serving as its arguments. On every stimulus that feature holds of exactly the
available antecedents (`local_iff_available`), so the target out-activates each distractor under
any weighting that gives the hierarchical cue weight (`target_retrieved`); a distractor that
matches the reciprocal in number still out-activates one that does not whenever item-level cues
carry weight, the interference both weightings predict (`distractor_interference`). On the
representational account after McElree and Oberauer, the noun phrases that c-command the
retrieval site from within its clause sit in a privileged store. That store holds exactly the
available antecedents (`privileged_iff_available`), so no distractor is accessed
(`not_privileged_second`).

## Implementation notes

* The trees keep the noun phrases, the heads that embed them and the verbal spine, and omit
  adverbs. The embedded clause is the complement of the matrix verb, and an adjunct is a sister
  of the lowest verb phrase.
* Argumenthood in Kush's feature is read off attachment, so a noun phrase is local when its
  mother is a clause or verb-phrase node of the retrieval site's clause.
* A cue is matched either against the hierarchical feature or against an item-level feature,
  and activation is the count of matched cues weighted by where they are matched.
