# von Fintel (1993): Exceptive Constructions

von Fintel gives the English *but*-phrase of *every student but John* a least-exception
semantics. Plain domain subtraction, reading *students but John* as the students minus John,
neither explains why *but* occurs only with *every* and *no* nor blocks the inference to
*every student but John and Jill*, and adding the requirement that the quantification fail
without the subtraction still admits *most*. On the least-exception semantics the *but*-phrase
instead names the exception set, the least set whose subtraction makes the quantification true
(`Exceptive.IsExceptionSet`), which with *every* is the restrictor minus the scope and with
*no* their intersection. Free exceptives like *except for John* carry subtraction with
restrictiveness only (`Exceptive.Restrictive`), which is why they also occur with *most*.

## Main statements

* `GuaranteesException`: a determiner guarantees an exception set when every false
  quantification has one. *Every* and *no* guarantee one, *some* never has one, and *most* has
  none in the paper's five-student situation though it has one in a two-student limiting case;
  the paper reads the co-occurrence restriction as a grammaticization of this contrast.
* `not_isExceptionSet_of_lt`, `eq_of_isExceptionSet_ident`: the unique least exception blocks
  the enlargement inference and the conjunction of two *but*-phrases.
* `not_exists_nounModifier`: no operation on the restrictor alone yields the *but*-phrase's
  truth conditions.
* `isExceptionSet_every_of_restrictive`: with a universal determiner the free exceptive
  pragmatically strengthens to the *but* reading.
* `but_predicted`, `exceptFor_predicted`: the paper's exceptive examples, read through the
  English fragment's determiner denotations, are judged acceptable exactly as the two
  semantics predict.

## Implementation notes

* Restrictor, scope and exception set are predicates ordered pointwise, so the truth
  conditions are lattice equations and the five-student and two-student models use `⊤` and
  `Fin` restrictors.
* The guarantee of an exception set is conditional on a false quantification, the paper's "if
  there is any at all"; the unconditional version also holds for *every* and *no*, whose
  exception set is then empty (`Exceptive.isExceptionSet_every`).
* The strengthening of a free exceptive to the *but* reading takes as hypothesis that the
  exception set contains only exceptions, the paper's gloss of the uniqueness condition, which
  pragmatics supplies.
* The determiner *any* of Horn's paradigm has no reading in the paper or the fragment, so its
  rows are not predicted; likewise the definite of *except for Jane, my relatives* and the
  minimality-based *besides*, which the paper leaves to further research.
* Not formalized: the two curryings of the *but*-phrase and the impossibility of an
  NP-modifier semantics, which is not derivable from *every* and *no* alone; the Cooper
  variable; the rhetorical reading of *who but*.

## TODO

* The paper's footnote on *both* and *neither* presumes they "give rise to unique exception
  sets"; under the library's cardinality-asserting `both` a false *both*-quantification has no
  exception set at all, so which semantics the footnote intends is undetermined and neither
  claim is stated.

/-! ### What *but* operates on (§1.8) -/

/-- The *but*-phrase cannot be a noun modifier (§1.8). No operation on the restrictor alone
yields the exception-set truth conditions with *every*, since with the whole domain as scope
the modified quantification is true while a nonempty `C` is not the exception set. -/

/-! ### Free exceptives (§2) -/

/-- In the situation of (25), *except for Tom and John, most students attended* holds where no
*but*-phrase does, so the free exceptive occurs with *most* (34c). -/
theorem restrictive_most :
    Restrictive most ⊤ (fun x : Fin 5 ↦ x = 0 ∨ x = 1) attended :=
  ⟨by decide, fun h ↦ absurd h (by decide)⟩

exception set that contains only exceptions (§2.3). -/

    IsExceptionSet every A C B :=
  isExceptionSet_every_iff.2 (le_antisymm (restrictive_every_iff.1 h).1 hC)

/-- With *no* the *but* reading is likewise the strengthening of the free exceptive (§2.3). -/
