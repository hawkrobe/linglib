# Schwab (2022): Lexical variation in NPI illusions

This file formalizes the paper's scalar account of the negative polarity illusion. Two speeded
acceptability experiments on German contrast the strengthening NPI *jemals* 'ever' with the
attenuating NPI *so recht* 'really' in a 2 × 3 design crossing the item with the position of a
negative quantifier: in the matrix clause, where it licenses the item, inside a relative clause,
where it cannot, or absent (`Data/Examples/Schwab2022`). Only *jemals* is illusorily licensed by
the relative-clause quantifier, an asymmetry that the cue-based retrieval, quantifier-scope and
pragmatic-rescuing accounts of the illusion do not foresee.

The account builds on the scalar theories of polarity sensitivity of [krifka-1995a],
[kadmon-landman-1993], [chierchia-2006] and [israel-1996]. A strengthening item is assertable
only where the proposition is stronger than every alternative it evokes, [krifka-1995a]'s
scalar assertion in the form of [condoravdi-2010] (`scalAssert`); an attenuating item where
some compatible alternative would have been more informative, the condition of Schwab and Liu
(`attenAssert`). The two conditions are opposed: when the proposition entails its alternatives,
scalar assertion is the plain update while the attenuating condition is contradictory
(`scalAssert_eq_of_isStrongest`, `attenAssert_eq_empty_of_isStrongest`), and an existential
under negation or an attenuating degree modifier under negation instantiates the licensed case
of each (`scalAssert_not_ever`, `attenAssert_not_atLeast`), while in the affirmative the
existential is covered by its more specific alternatives (`scalAssert_ever_eq_empty`) and the
degree modifier entails its lower ones (`isStrongest_atLeast`). The illusion arises, on the
paper's proposal after the environment-based account of [muller-phillips-2020], when the
parser feeds the mechanism the still-active relative-clause proposition and its Horn-scale
alternatives instead of the main clause: a negative quantifier is the strongest point of its
scale, so the strengthening mechanism accepts it and the attenuating one rejects it
(`illusion_asymmetry`).

## Implementation notes

* Propositions are sets of worlds and the context is a set of worlds; an alternative is
  informative after the assertion when the context updated with the assertion does not entail
  it (`Informative`), the paper's `c + p + p' ≠ c + p`. Alternatives are an arbitrary set of
  propositions, so the lexical scales are hypotheses on it: the specific times of an
  existential and the lower degrees of a degree modifier.
* The experimental results are recorded in the example rows' comments (posterior estimates and
  Bayes factors); the parser's activation story that selects the relative-clause proposition
  is not modeled, only what each mechanism returns once it is selected.
