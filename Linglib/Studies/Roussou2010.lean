# Roussou (2010): Selecting complementizers

This file formalizes the paper's account of the Modern Greek complementizers as nominal
elements, each with a lexical specification that fixes what it can embed and what can embed it
(`profile`). *oti*, *an*, and *pu* merge outside the clause, as the internal argument of the
matrix verb, and take a proposition: *oti* is an indefinite over propositions, *an* an
indefinite that is a polarity item, and *pu* a definite, which is why a *pu*-clause is factive,
its content presupposed and projecting through negation (`puClause_factive`,
`pu_projects_through_negation`), while the *oti*-clause of the same verb carries only the weak,
deniable presupposition the verb supplies. *na* merges inside the clause and reopens the
subject position, so a *na*-clause is a property rather than a proposition and cannot be
embedded under the outside mergers (`comp_over_na_type_clash`). The distribution follows from
the specifications and the lexical semantics of the selecting predicate: *an* needs a binder,
an interrogative predicate or a matrix negation or question over a proposition-taking one
(`polar_needs_binder`); *pu* needs an emotive factive, a recollection reading, or a focused
predicate; *na* is taken freely by volitionals and verbs of knowing, with control, and by
epistemic predicates only in the present tense (`epistemic_na_present`). The paper's examples
are rows, read by `rows` as the analysis predicts.

## Implementation notes

The matrix predicates are entries of the Greek fragment, classified for selection as the paper
classifies them; the classification is the paper's, with the recollection sense of *thimáme*
the fragment's stative entry, and *nomízo*'s need of an operator for its *na*-complement a
lexical mark. The type-level incompatibility of the outside mergers with *na* is stated on the
composition substrate's types, propositions as `t` and properties as `⟨e,t⟩`. Control, the
dynamic modal reading of *kséro* with *na*, the Romance and English parallels, and the paper's
argument against uninterpretable features are not formalized.

/-! ### The lexical specification -/

/-- The quantification over propositions an outside-merging complementizer contributes: an
indefinite ranging over a set of propositions, a polar indefinite requiring a binder, or a
definite binding a single proposition. -/
inductive Quantification
  | indefinite
  | polar
  | definite
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The lexical specification of a clause-typing element: merging outside the clause, as the
matrix verb's argument, with a quantification over propositions, or inside its lower C domain,
binding no propositional variable. -/
inductive Spec
  | outside (q : Quantification)
  | inside
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The specification of the Modern Greek complementizers: *oti* indefinite, *an* polar, *pu*
definite, all outside, and *na* inside. -/
def profile (c : Complementizer) : Option Spec :=
  if c = oti then some (.outside .indefinite)
  else if c = an then some (.outside .polar)
  else if c = pu then some (.outside .definite)
  else if c = na then some .inside
  else none

/-- The fragment's lexical factivity is definiteness: the one definite complementizer is the
one factive one, the factive reading of an *oti*-clause being the verb's. -/

/-! ### The denotations -/

/-- The *oti*-clause: an indefinite over propositions, asserting its content without
presupposition. -/

/-- The *an*-clause: the polar set of the proposition and its negation. -/

when its content holds there. -/
theorem puClause_factive (p : Set W) (w : W) : (puClause p).defined w ↔ w ∈ p := Iff.rfl

/-- The presupposition of the *pu*-clause projects through negation, so denying it still
commits to its content, while the *oti*-clause is defined everywhere and its denial carries no
factive residue. -/

is a property: application is undefined whatever the merger returns. -/

/-! ### Selection -/

/-- The classes of selecting predicate the paper distinguishes: interrogatives, which bind the
polar complementizer themselves; verbs of knowing, which take any complement; epistemic verbs,
which take *na* only in the present tense, some of them only under an operator; volitionals,
which take *na* alone; emotive factives, which take *pu* alone; emotives that take *pu* on a
factive and *oti* on a non-factive reading; factive non-emotives, which take *oti* and not
*pu*; verbs of saying; and the recollection sense of *remember*, which takes *pu*. -/
