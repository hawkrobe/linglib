# Dayal, *Questions* (2016)

The book's baseline theory, chapter 2, blends the three classic theories of
questions into the account the later chapters build on.
From Hamblin it keeps the denotation, a set of propositions; from Karttunen
the truth requirement, moved out of the denotation into an answerhood
operator, because in scope marking (*What does John think? Where is Mary?*)
the second question must contribute its false members too; from Groenendijk
and Stokhof strong exhaustiveness, obtained by Heim's device of collecting
the worlds with the same answer. Its own contribution is number sensitivity:
*which woman* ranges over the atoms of a Sharvy–Link domain, *which women* and
*who* over the whole domain, and Ans-D returns the true member that entails
every other true member, so a singular question presupposes exactly one
witness and a plural one at least one, while Beck and Rullmann's intersection
operator, being number-blind, cannot draw the distinction. The same operator
makes a polar question with a *wh* phrase unanswerable, and its existential
presupposition is a soft one, deniable only by another speaker, which a cleft
turns hard.

We state the scope-marking argument on a two-place model, the number paradigm
over any atomistic complete lattice, the polar-*wh* and Beck–Rullmann
comparisons, and check the chapter's judgments.

## Implementation notes

* A situation is identified with the plurality the nucleus holds of, so the
  nucleus proposition for `x` is `Set.Ici x`; this builds in the distributivity
  the chapter's entailments assume (*John likes Mary and Betty* entails *John
  likes Mary*).
* The plurality implicature of a plural *wh* is a stated felicity condition
  (`Felicitous`), not part of Ans-D, as in the chapter.

## TODO

* Chapters 3–6: the weak–strong distinction and mention-some answers, pair-list
  and functional answers, embedded and concealed questions, and weak islands
  through maximality are not formalized.
