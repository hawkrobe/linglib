# Schöter's evidential bilattices: `PRESUP` and the evidential progression
[schoter-1996]

[schoter-1996]'s Evidential Bilattice Logic analyzes natural-language entailment,
implicature, and presupposition by climbing a progression of evidential
bilattices `S ⊙ S` (`Bilattice.Evidential`): `classical ⊂` Kleene-3 `⊂ FOUR ⊂
PRESUP` (Fig. 1). A value is a pair `(for, against)` of degrees of evidence
drawn from a chain `S` — the paper writes `⟨a, b⟩` for `(against, for)`
(reversing Fitting's coordinate order, as its fn. to §2.1 notes); this file
keeps the library's `(for, against)` = Fitting order throughout.

This file is the second consumer of the `Bilattice` substrate (the first is
`Studies.Fitting1994`, which shows Kleene-3 = the consistent fragment of `FOUR`).
It formalizes the paper's *value level*:

* **`PRESUP := Evidential (Fin 3)`** — evidence from the 3-chain `0 < ½ < 1`
  (§2.1): the nine values `U, T, F, I, P⁺, P⁻, C, D⁺, D⁻`. The orderings and
  inversions of Defs 1–2 are the substrate's `≤`/`≤ₖ`, `Product.neg`, and
  `Evidential.conf`; the meets and joins of Def 3 are `⊓`/`⊔`/`⊗`/`⊕`.
* **`embed : FOUR → PRESUP`** — `FOUR` is a sub-bilattice of `PRESUP`
  (order-preserving in both `≤` and `≤ₖ`): Schöter's "`FOUR` is a sublattice
  of all bilattices."
* **partitions of the evidential space** (§2.2) — `Bilattice.Evidential`'s
  consistent/classical fragments plus the paper's designated (`Designated`)
  and semi-designated (`SemiDesignated`) subspaces, with their order-theoretic
  characterizations and the closure facts of §2.2.
* **value-level connectives** — Fitting's guard `φ : ψ` (Def 4), the
  semi-designation function `σ` (Def 5), the value-level `presumably` operator
  `π` (Def 14, clause 2), and the evidential-weighting function `f⋆` (Def 16)
  onto the constants of [ginsberg-1988]'s `DEFAULT` bilattice.

Scope: the value space, the progression, and the value-level operators.
Schöter's epistemic-state apparatus (setups, evidential links, assertion /
evaluation / closure, `FOEBL`/`FOMEBL`, and the §4 data analyses that run on
the implemented engine) is out of scope.
