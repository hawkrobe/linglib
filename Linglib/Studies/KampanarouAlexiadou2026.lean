# Kampanarou and Alexiadou (2026): Genitive Alternation in Possessives and Beyond

This file formalizes [kampanarou-alexiadou-2026], on the Standard Modern Greek alternation
between an inflectional genitive and a prepositional *apo*-phrase, with adnominal possessors and
with the arguments of derived nominals. The paper argues that the alternation is structural rather
than morphological: the *apo*-PP is not an alternative spell-out of the genitive but a complement
with a partitive semantics, through which a possessive reading is coerced.

The possessive data of Sections 2, 3 and 5 are rows carrying the paper's classification of the
relation and of the possessor nominal (`Possessor`). Part-whole and source relations alternate
with a common-noun possessor, pronouns and proper names never do, and acceptability is monotone in
the facilitation order on possessors, which adds plural marking, modification, or a paradigm gap
of the genitive (`facilitation_mono`); a gap is neither sufficient nor necessary for the
alternation.

For derived nominals (Sections 2 and 6), the complex-event reading of [grimshaw-1990] survives
only under a genitive theme, an *apo* agent is a by-phrase only under that reading, and the
nominal otherwise admits at most one argument (`Nominal.WellFormed`): the single argument
restriction of Section 8, extending the single genitive restriction of [horrocks-stavrou-1987] to
PPs. Grevena Greek, which has lost the inflectional genitive
([michelioudakis-chatzikyriakidis-spathas-2024]), stacks two *apo*-PPs. The scope data of
Section 7 follow from the merge site of the possessor (`Site`): the genitive of an inalienable
possessor and every *apo*-PP are complements ([alexiadou-2003]), and only a complement possessor
admits surface scope (`scope_rows_agree`).

## Implementation notes

The paper's markers are read on the `Judgment` scale, `?` as `marginal`, `??` and `???` as
`questionable`, `#` as `unacceptable` and `*` as `ungrammatical`; a row is `Acceptable` from
`marginal` up, since `?` marks speaker variation. The three syntactic analyses of Section 7
(selection by the possessee, a predicative small clause, a light *p*) share the consequence
formalized here, that the *apo*-PP is a complement, and are not distinguished. The recursive
possessives (25) to (27) record, as the paper does, that only the innermost possessor alternates;
its footnote 14 offers no account.
