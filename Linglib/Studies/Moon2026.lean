# Moon (2026): countability and measured parts in mixed drink nouns

Mixed drink nouns (*martini*, *cappuccino*) are count nouns that denote liquids. Moon derives their
countability from their part structure: a mixed drink is a mereological sum of ingredient parts
standing in a fixed ratio of measures (`Recipe`, `RatioHolds`), one of which — the shot of liquor or
espresso, the MEASURED PART — supplies the unit of individuation, and the whole is a connected
liquid, self-connected in the mereotopological sense of Casati and Varzi and of Grimm under a
connection relation `C` (`ConnectedLiquid`, `Mereology.SelfConnected`). The denotation
`mixedDrinkDen` packages Moon's final formula as the existence of a `MixedDrinkWitness`.

Two consequences carry the countability argument. The sum of two spatially separate drinks is not a
connected liquid, so the denotation is not cumulative (`not_mixedDrinkDen_of_not_selfConnected`), a
mereotopological route to non-cumulativity that a bare semilattice lacks, where it comes only from
quantization (`connectivity_breaks_cum`). And a mixed drink has proper parts, so it is not a
mereological atom (`mixedDrink_not_atom`), and the atomicity on which count theories found
countability excludes it (`atomsOf_excludes_mixed_drinks`), while half a drink with its ratios
preserved is still a drink, so the denotation is not quantized either (`mixedDrink_not_qua`). Mixed
drinks thus occupy Filip's ¬CUM ∧ ¬QUA middle ground (`mixedDrink_middle_ground`), and the gap
propagates to drinking VPs through `middle_ground_stable` (`mixedDrink_VP_propagation_gap`).
Multipliers such as *double* rescale the measured part's ratio constant rather than the whole
(`doubleRecipe`, Wągiel's subatomic quantification), and *dry* rescales another ingredient's
(`modifyRatio`).

Moon's corpus and judgment data stay in prose: in her COCA counts (Appendix A) cocktail
nouns pattern with count nouns on bare plurals and numerals while non-count drink nouns
take bare singulars and containers; countability survives coercion contexts such as
*pitcher of martinis*; and *who drank more americanos?* is ambiguous between volume,
portions, and measured parts.

## Implementation notes

Self-connection is Moon's (20b), stated with the library's overlap, which unlike (20a) relates
non-null parts only; connected liquid (23) is read with this notion rather than the touch-based
self-connection of (22), and without its temporal parameter.

condition, so this is her ratio formula (19) plus CONNECTED LIQUID; she notes that (19)
alone also covers ratio-structured non-count drinks such as *lemonade*. -/
