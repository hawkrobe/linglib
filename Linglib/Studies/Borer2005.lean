# Borer (2005): In Name Only

This file formalizes the count structure of [borer-2005]. Noun stems denote cumulative stuff and
are mass by default; the mass/count distinction is not lexical but structural, with two open
values in the nominal spine assigned range by the functional lexicon. The classifier head ⟨e⟩div
divides the stuff, and plural inflection is the head feature that assigns it range, so a bare
plural is divided but not counted (27). The quantity head ⟨e⟩# counts the divisions or measures
undivided mass, *much salt* projecting no classifier phrase (28). Cardinals other than *one* and
the plural-taking quantifiers are pure counters, which is why *two meat* and *two boy* fail (29),
while *a*, *one*, *every* and *each* are portmanteau morphemes assigning range to both open
values (30), as are the cardinals of Hungarian, Turkish and Armenian, which never co-occur with
plural inflection (36) to (38); *all* takes a mass or a plural restriction and, dividing nothing,
has no count reading on a bare stem (35). Each open value takes range once, so *every boys* and
*several a boy* are out, and the distribution of the determiner classes of (20) over bare stems
and plurals follows. Division creates no individuals: a reticule may have no complete cell, as
in *zero apples* and *0.5 apples*, and individuals emerge only when a counter selects a reticule
with the requisite number of cells, so *more than three circles* presupposes circles where bare
*circles* does not.

## Main definitions

* `Determiner`: what a range assigner does at ⟨e⟩#, counting, measuring or either, and whether it
  also assigns range to ⟨e⟩div.
* `Nominal`: a nominal by its determiner, if any, and its plural inflection, with `Divided` and
  `WellFormed`, the two principles of range assignment.
* `IsDivision`, `count`: a reticule over stuff, a finset of cells, and the number of its complete
  cells.
* `status`: the mereological type a nominal spine composes bottom-up.

## Main results

* `wellFormed_counter_iff`, `not_wellFormed_of_divides`, `wellFormed_measure_iff`,
  `wellFormed_neutral`: the distribution of the determiner classes derived from range assignment.
* `sup'_mem`: divided stuff is still stuff, which is `SupClosed.finsetSup'_mem`.
* `exists_division_without_units`, `exists_unit_of_count_pos`: individuals emerge at ⟨e⟩#,
  not at ⟨e⟩div.
* `q_below_num`: dividing feeds counting and nothing divides a quantity, the order the
  functional sequence records.

## Implementation notes

The two open values ⟨e⟩div and ⟨e⟩# are the heads `Q` and `Num` of the substrate's nominal
sequence. The existential closure and generic binding of ⟨e⟩d, the Hebrew and Chinese systems
and the measure phrases of the later chapters are not formalized.

/-! ### Dividing without individuating

Assigning range to ⟨e⟩div superimposes reticules on a mass denotation; a reticule carves cells,
none of which need be a canonical unit, and the counter at ⟨e⟩# selects among the reticules one
with the number of complete cells it requires. -/

apples plus apples being apples, the cumulativity bare plurals share with mass nouns. -/
