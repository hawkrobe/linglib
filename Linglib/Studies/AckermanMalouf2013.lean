# Ackerman and Malouf (2013): Morphological Organization: The Low Conditional Entropy Conjecture

Ackerman and Malouf separate the enumerative complexity of an inflectional system — how many
cells, realizations, and inflection classes it has — from its integrative complexity, the
average conditional entropy of one paradigm cell given another
(`Morphology.ParadigmSystem.avgCondEntropy`), and conjecture that the latter stays low however
large the former grows. Their Modern Greek nominal fragment carries the argument: its eight
declensions violate paradigm economy and fill a tiny corner of the space its per-cell
realizations allow, while implicative structure keeps the speaker's task small, and the paper's
two worked conditional entropies come out as exact closed forms. Burmeso's vocabularly clear
object agreement sits at the zero of the measure, and Chiquihuitlán Mazatec's final-vowel and
tone classes sit far from it, the prose claim that only third-person vowels are diagnostic
sharpened to what its Table 6 supports.

## Main statements

* `greek_not_paradigmEconomy`, `greek_principalParts`: Greek violates the enumerative
  principles while keeping a small principal-part set.
* `greek_genSg_given_accPl_a`, `greek_genSg_given_accPl`: the paper's worked conditional
  entropies (13) and (14) as exact closed forms, `log 3 − (2/3) log 2` and `(3/8) log 3` nats.
* `burmeso_avgCondEntropy`: vocabular clarity makes Burmeso's average conditional entropy zero.
* `mazatec_vowels_diagnosticity`, `mazatec_tones_no_diagnostic_cell`: how far the Mazatec
  final vowels and tones are from clarity.

## Implementation notes

* Class probabilities are `uniformOn Set.univ`, the paper's (5), under which every printed
  number is computed; entropies are in nats, the paper's bits are these divided by `log 2`.
* `avgCondEntropy` averages over ordered pairs of distinct cells, which reproduces Table 2's
  expected values and its grand average; the running text prints a different rounding of the
  latter.
* Table 1 yields five rival genitive singulars and a realization-space of 25600 class
  candidates where pp. 445–446 count six and 46,080 on richer data than Table 1.

## TODO

* `greek_avgCondEntropy`: the closed form of Table 2's grand average, provable from
  `condEntropy_uniformOn_univ` with a per-pair count table.
* Table 5's average entropies and the tone system's realization count are computed on the
  appendix's full Table A6 data and do not follow from Tables 6–7, so they are not stated.
