# Wood (2023): Icelandic Nominalizations and Allosemy

This file formalizes [wood-2023]'s account of Icelandic deverbal nominalizations as complex
heads: a root categorized by v and then by n, with no verb phrase and no Voice, whose
ambiguity between complex event, simple event, and referring readings is allosemy of v and n
(`Derivation`). A complex event nominal has eventive v and zero n, so the noun inherits the
verb's meaning; the simple readings have zero v and a contentful n. Borer's Generalization,
that a complex event reading entails a morphologically related verb with that meaning, follows
from two facts: only v introduces the event variable, and n is not in the root's domain, so it
cannot condition root suppletion past v (`borers_generalization`). The nominal's external
argument is introduced by i*, the head that is Voice in the verbal domain, interpreted as an
agent in the context of an eventive nP and as a possessor otherwise (`IStar.alloseme`).

The form side is contextual allomorphy on the same complex head. The nominalizers *-un*,
*-ing*, *-sla*, *-stur* and the rest are exponents of one n, each listed for a set of roots or
for an overt verbalizer, with no elsewhere item (`Allomorphy.vocab`); Vocabulary Insertion runs
from the inside out over the concatenated neighbors, null exponents pruned
(`ComplexHead.insertAll`). Two of the book's descriptive generalizations are then theorems: the
nominalizer is chosen by the verbalizer whenever that is overt, since it hides the root, and by
the root otherwise (`Allomorphy.nominalizer_of_ne_zero`, `Allomorphy.nominalizer_of_eq_zero`),
so that *-k* takes *-un* and *-er* takes *-ing* whatever the root; and a root that no item
lists has no nominalization at all, the book's *borða* 'eat' (`Allomorphy.nominalizer_eq_none`).
Every segmentation in `Fragments.Icelandic.Nouns` is derived this way
(`Allomorphy.fragment_realize`).

Special meaning is subject to phase locality: a dependency may cross at most one categorizer
(`Local`). A preposition heading the PP complement of a nominal is separated from the root by
v and n, so a preposition that conditions the root's meaning must adjoin to the complex n head
as a prefix, while one with its own meaning heads a PP, and one that does both is doubled
(`nominal_complement_not_local`). The same bound lets n condition an idiosyncratic root meaning
across v (`nominal_n_local`) and forbids it in *-væðing* nominals, where *-væða* is a compound
head attaching to a categorized word, so that two categorizers separate the root from the
outer n (`vaeda_n_not_local`). The prefixes *marg-* and *endur-* are event modifiers: *marg-*
adjoins to v, *endur-* to v or to n, and each needs an event variable at its host, which
licenses *marg-* exactly on nominals whose v is eventive and *endur-* also on simple event and
result nominals but not on simple entities (`Licensed`); the book's judgments on the prefixed
readings of *þvottur* and *prentun* are the rows of `Data.Examples.Wood2023`, checked one by one
(`rows_licensed`). Allosemy is contextual as allomorphy is: *aðdáun* and *viðvörun* share the
nominalizer *-un*, and only the second has a concrete entity reading
(`reading_not_by_nominalizer`).

## Implementation notes

The exponents of the roots and affixes are the surface morphs of the fragment, so the u-umlaut
of *söfn-un* and *vönt-un* is not undone and the theme vowel *-a* of the verb is absent, as
the book's own segmentation has it. The roots are identified by their forms. The prefixed
preposition of *við-ger-ð* adjoins to n and is not inserted by the vocabulary; the derivation
covers the root, v, and n. Wood's bound for allosemy, one intervening categorizer, is one
phase looser than `Spine.RootLocal`, the bound the book keeps for root suppletion; the study
states the strict one through the substrate. A preposition adjoined to a complex head has no
spine position, since a head does not c-command its own adjunct, so the heads between a
preposition and the root are read off its attachment. The event-modifier account licenses
*marg-* on a result nominal built on eventive v, a case the book does not test.
