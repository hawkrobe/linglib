# Asher & Lascarides 2003: the right frontier

In Segmented Discourse Representation Theory a discourse is a set of labelled constituents
whose contents include rhetorical relations between labels. New information may attach only
at an available label: the last label, any label whose content contains a relation mentioning
an available label, and any label linked to an available one by a subordinating relation —
Elaboration, Explanation, or the topic relation — but not by a coordinating one such as
Narration or Background. In the book's five-sentence narrative, an evening elaborated by a
meal and a dance competition, with the meal elaborated by salmon and cheese, the salmon clause
is off the frontier once the competition is last, so *It was a beautiful pink* cannot continue
the discourse. In the book's abstract example, a topic over a constituent containing two units
related by Background, the first of those units is the one label not available.

## Main definitions

* `Rel`, `Rel.Subordinating`: rhetorical relations, including the topic relation ⇓.
* `SDRS`, `SDRS.Above`, `SDRS.Available`: labelled structures, one-step ascent on the
  frontier, and availability as its reflexive-transitive closure from the last label.
* `example17`, `example21`: the two worked structures and their frontiers.
