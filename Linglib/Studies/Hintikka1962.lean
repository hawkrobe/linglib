# Hintikka (1962): Knowledge and Belief

This file formalizes the model-set semantics of [hintikka-1962] for the operators "a knows
that", "it is possible, for all that a knows, that", "a believes that" and "it is compatible
with everything a believes that", and the book's applications of it to Moore's sentence "p but
I do not believe that p" and to knowing that one knows. A `ModelSystem` is a set of model
sets, partial descriptions of states of affairs closed under the (C) conditions of Chapter 3,
with epistemic and doxastic alternativeness relations between them; a set of sentences is
`Defensible` when it can be embedded in a member of a model system, and a sentence
`VirtuallyImplies` another when the implication between them is self-sustaining. Chapter 4's
solution to Moore's problem is that the sentence is defensible but its believed form is not,
so that the sentence is `DoxasticallyIndefensible` for its speaker to utter; the reductive
arguments of the book are the proofs, one condition per step, and the model systems it
exhibits are possible-worlds models carried to model systems by `Model.toModelSystem`.
Chapter 5's equivalence of knowing and knowing that one knows, and the failure of its
doxastic counterpart in Section 5.10, close the file.

## Implementation notes

* Model systems carry the first of the combinations of conditions listed in Section 3.4,
  (C.K) with (C.KK*), and the belief conditions (C.b*), (C.B*) and (C.BB*) of Section 3.5;
  the reflexivity and transitivity of alternativeness that the book shows to be equivalent to
  these as far as defensibility is concerned are the frame conditions of `Model`, whose truth
  sets are model sets.
* Virtual implication is the self-sustenance of the material implication, as in Section 2.6;
  Section 3.10 is used in the direction from the indefensibility of the antecedent with the
  negated consequent to the self-sustenance of the implication, the only direction the
  reductive arguments need, since the failures of virtual implication are witnessed by models.
* Doxastic and epistemic indefensibility are defined for a sentence, the conjunction of the
  book's finite set of statements.

/-! ### Possible-worlds models

Section 2.8 glosses the notions in terms of worlds "in which everybody follows the
consequences of what he knows as far as they lead him": a model is a set of such worlds with
epistemic alternativeness reflexive and transitive, doxastic alternativeness serial and
transitive, and doxastic alternatives among the epistemic ones, the frame conditions that the
book shows to be equivalent to its conditions (Sections 3.4 to 3.6). The formulas true at a
world form a model set, and the truth sets of a model form a model system, so that
satisfiability in a model yields defensibility. -/

Moore's sentence (8), "p but I do not believe that p", is defensible, but (30)*, its believed
form, is not: what uttering (8) violates is the presumption that the speaker can believe what
he says (Sections 4.5 and 4.6). The believed form of the third-person variant (8)(a) is
defensible unless the believer is the person spoken about. -/
