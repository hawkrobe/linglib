# Baker & Vinokurova 2010: two modalities of case assignment in Sakha

Sakha's four structural cases split in half. Accusative and dative are dependent cases: an NP
is valued accusative when a distinct caseless NP c-commands it in the clause, and dative when
it c-commands one in the verb phrase, where there is no accusative rule. Nominative and
genitive are assigned by T and D under agreement, and there is no elsewhere case: an NP that no
rule and no head reaches must be pseudo-incorporated into the verb — an unshifted VP-internal
NP adjacent to it — or the structure is out. Object shift makes differential object marking a
phase effect; the causee of a causative is dative exactly when the base verb is transitive; a
passive theme is accusative exactly when a covert agent is present; the object of an agentive
nominalization is accusative though no v is present; a subject raised into an impersonal clause
stays unmarked; and a finite verb agrees with an NP exactly when it values that NP nominative.
A purely configurational grammar with elsewhere cases overgenerates the Case-filter and
agreement violations, and a purely Agree-based grammar never values a dative.

## Main definitions

* `grammar`: the two-modality grammar of Sakha.
* `pureMarantz`, `pureChomsky`: the two pure grammars beside it.
* `subject`, `internal`, `possessor`, `pro`, `finite`: the NP positions and the finite probe
  the paper's derivations use.
* `Slot`, `candidates`: the NPs of a row's domain from the slots the rows name, highest first;
  the covert agent and object shift are the free choices where the paper leaves them free.
* `derive`, `Licensed`, `Agrees`, `Derivable`: assignment with the probes a row's morphology
  shows, the Case filter, the case–agreement link, and derivability under some choice.

## Main results

* `dom`, `ditransitive`, `causative`, `passive`, `agentive_nominal`, `raising`, `promise`,
  `possessed`: the paper's constructions.
* `no_elsewhere_case`, `pureChomsky_no_dative`: Sakha values nothing as unmarked, and an
  Agree-only grammar values nothing dative, whatever the domain.
* `rows_case`: acceptability is derivability under the two-modality grammar.
* `pure_marantz_overgenerates`: without the Case filter and the agreement link, the
  configurational grammar derives rejected examples.
