# Fillmore, Kay & O'Connor (1988): Regularity and idiomaticity in grammatical constructions

This file formalizes the semantics of the *let alone* construction in
[fillmore-kay-oconnor-1988]. A *let alone* sentence F ⟨X A Y let alone B⟩ (20) asserts the two
propositions F′(X A Y) and F′(X B Y) (24) and presupposes a scalar model in which they are
distinct points, the full clause the stronger (§2.3). The Appendix defines the model in five
steps: an argument space, the product of at least two linearly ordered dimensions (A1), with its
product order as "lower than" (A2, `lower_iff`); a propositional function `P` such that, for
distinct points, `P b` entails `P a` exactly when `a` is lower than `b` (A3, `IsScalarModel`);
the same for the negated propositions (A4, `IsScalarModel.not_le_not_iff`); and informativeness
as one-way entailment (A5), the strict order on propositions, which A3 turns into the order on
points (`IsScalarModel.lt_iff`, `IsScalarModel.not_lt_not_iff`). The states of affairs of Tables
1–4, where truth propagates from the one-corner and falsity from the zero-corner, are the lower
sets of the argument space, and every lower-set state space is a scalar model
(`isScalarModel_mem`). The semantic conditions of §2.3.2 — one model, one polarity, the full
clause stronger (`Felicitous`) — thus reduce to an order on the foci: under negation A is lower
than B, under positive polarity higher (`felicitous_negative_iff`, `felicitous_positive_iff`).
Hence a fragment naming the lowest point of its scale is anomalous, (107) against (106)
(`not_felicitous_of_isBot`), and exchanging the foci of one dimension between points that
differ on two leaves them incomparable, (122) against (121) (`swap_incomparable`). The ranks of
(21), (106)–(107) and (130)–(132), the linguists and languages of Tables 1–4 and (109)–(112),
and the four dimensions of (121)–(122) instantiate the theory; the paper's judgments are the
rows of `Data/Examples/FillmoreKayOConnor1988.json`, and `rankRows_predicted` and
`focusRows_predicted` check them against `Felicitous` and the order in which the conjunction
presents the stronger clause (p. 533).

The construction itself is a formal idiom in the sense of §1, the typology of which is
`ConstructionGrammar.Idiom` (`letAloneConstruction_isFormalIdiom`). Its syntax (§2.2) — a
coordination that neither topicalizes nor clefts as a unit (31)–(34), admits no VP ellipsis
because the INFL-complex belongs to the trigger F (39)–(41), and is licensed in the affective
environments of [klima-1964] (62)–(70) yet attested under positive polarity when the fragment
denies the context proposition (71)–(73) — and its pragmatics (§2.4), the fragment answering
Relevance and the full clause Quantity, are the rows' comments and the docstrings below. Scales
are pragmatic, in the tradition of [fauconnier-1975] rather than the semantic scales of
[horn-1972] and [gazdar-1979], and a scalar model needs a second dimension to bear its degrees
(fn. 16, after [cresswell-1976]).

## Implementation notes

* `IsScalarModel` is stated over any partial order; the product order of (A1)–(A2) enters
  through `lower_iff`, and the stipulation of at least two dimensions (fn. 16) is not part of the
  predicate. The one-dimensional rank chain is therefore treated as the slice of the persons ×
  ranks model that fn. 16 envisages, and a slice of a scalar model is a scalar model
  (`IsScalarModel.slice`).
* A state of affairs is a `LowerSet` of the argument space and the propositional function is
  membership: "he made colonel" holds in a career exactly when colonel is among the ranks
  reached. The paper's Tables 2 and 4 draw four such states; `table2c` is the one that
  separates *Brilliant can read English* from *Brilliant can read Greek*.
* `force` renders F′ as negation or identity. The paper leaves open why only the negative part
  of *barely* reaches the fragment (§2.3.3, (118)–(119)); the *barely* rows are judgment data
  without a model, as are the constituency and licensing rows of §2.2.
* The ranks are the three the paper names; *a commissioned officer* in (106)–(107) is "made the
  lowest commissioned rank", since in a lower-set state holding some rank is holding the lowest.
* The (104)/(105) contrast rests on the two-dimension stipulation and on a lottery model the
  paper describes but does not build; (104) is a row without a model.
