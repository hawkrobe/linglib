# Shen and Huang (2026): The Role of Phases and Specificity in Definite Islands

This file formalizes [shen-huang-2026]'s two-constraint theory of the definite island effect,
the degradation of a wh-dependency into a definite depiction nominal. The Phase Impenetrability
Condition (4) freezes the wh-phrase in the complement of a definite determiner ((5),
`impenetrable`) unless a verb of creation has incorporated the determiner and collapsed the
phase, after [davies-dubinsky-2003] and [boskovic-2015]; the Specificity Condition (13) forbids
binding a variable inside a specific DP from outside, whether by a moved wh-phrase or by a
question operator ([fiengo-1987], [huang-1982b], [li-1992]). A fronted wh-phrase leaves a
deleted copy in the DP, and the PIC is violated when the link between the two leaves the phase
from its interior (`Minimalist.Crosses`); a wh-phrase in situ is bound there and has one copy, so
no link and nothing for the PIC to constrain. Constraint stacking (§4.1) counts the constraints of
an account that a configuration violates (`violations`); of the accounts built from the two
constraints, only their combination predicts the observed pattern, a definite island in both
English and Mandarin with a verb-of-creation effect for fronted wh-phrases alone (`observed_iff`).
Binding escapes the PIC because it adds no ordering statement under cyclic linearization (§4.2,
`binding_consistent`). On the LF-movement analysis of wh-in-situ (§5.2), with covert movement
subject to the PIC, an in-situ wh-phrase has a deleted copy above it whose link leaves the DP, and
no account predicts the absence of a verb-of-creation effect in Mandarin
(`not_observed_covert`).

## Implementation notes

* The experiments' effect sizes stay out of the formalization: the theory predicts the presence
  and direction of the contrasts, not their magnitude, which the paper notes differs across the
  two languages.
* Incorporation is read off the verb: a verb of creation incorporates the determiner. The
  conditions on incorporation the paper leaves open, and the information-structure rival of §5.1,
  are not formalized. The LF-movement analysis enters only in the variant with covert movement
  subject to the PIC; the paper's further point against it, that English verbs of creation still
  show a smaller definite island, is a matter of effect sizes.
* The extracted wh-phrase moves out of the DP in one step, the escape hatch at its edge being
  denied (§2.1); the verb phrase stands in for the clause.
