# Lo Guercio (2025): Maximize Conventional Implicatures!

This file formalizes Lo Guercio's anti-conventional implicatures: scalar
inferences that arise from comparing the conventionally implicated content of formal
alternatives, as scalar implicatures compare at-issue content and antipresuppositions
presuppositional content. Conventionally implied meaning is a restriction on the contexts
of felicitous use, so one sentence has stronger such content than another when its felicity
set is a proper subset of the other's, and the principle Maximize Conventional Implicatures!
forbids a sentence when a formal alternative in the sense of Katzir and of Fox and
Katzir, one no more complex than it, has stronger content. All three principles
are instances of the substrate's `Alternatives.Blocked`, here along conventional-implicature
content.

The worked case is the epithet. Out of the blue, *John arrived first* carries no inference
that John is no bastard, because *that bastard John arrived first* is not a formal
alternative: the epithet construction is a determiner phrase with three daughters, which no
chain of deletions, contractions, and substitutions from a source of lexical items and
one-daughter phrases can build (`outOfBlue_no_ACI`, through
`Alternatives.subtree_preservation`). Once *that bastard Pedro* has been
mentioned, its phrase enters the substitution source, the epithet alternative is derived by
substituting it for the subject and then *John* for *Pedro*, the paper's derivation (24)
(`epithet_alternative_priorMention`), and the inference arises (`priorMention_yes_ACI`): the
bare sentence is then used exactly where the speaker does not hold the attitude
(`useCondition_priorMention`), where out of the blue it is used whatever the attitude
(`useCondition_outOfBlue`).

## Implementation notes

The felicity-set semantics of the paper's (12) is `expressiveCI`: a sentence is felicitous
at a world unless it contains the epithet construction and the speaker does not hold the
attitude there. The honorific *don/doña* of the paper's §3.2.1, the Japanese honorifics of
its §3.2.2, the expressive adjectives of its §3.2.4, and the embeddability and oddness
discussion of its §4 are rows of `Data/Examples/LoGuercio2025.json` and prose, not
theorems.
