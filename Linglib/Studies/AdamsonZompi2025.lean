# Polite pronouns and the person-case constraint

The Italian polite pronoun LEI is formally third person feminine singular but refers to the
addressee, and in a ditransitive clitic cluster it patterns with the second person. Adamson and
Zompì give polite pronouns two person values, an uninterpretable one read by agreement and an
interpretable one read at LF, and argue that the person-case constraint reads the interpretable
one. A person restriction is stated over a person valuation of pronoun entries (`Licit`): the
agreement valuation `Morphosyntactic` reads the fragments' `person` and the LF valuation
`Syntacticosemantic` their `referentialPerson`.

## Main results

* `morphosyntactic_iff_of_ordinary`: the two valuations coincide on ordinary pronouns.
* `morphosyntactic_lei_formal`, `syntacticosemantic_lei_formal`: agreement-keyed restrictions
  treat LEI as *lei*, interpretation-keyed ones as *tu*.
* `lei_accusative`: on the Weak and Strong grammars the interpretable valuation bans a third
  person dative over accusative LEI, which the agreement valuation licenses, as do the accounts of
  `deal_licenses_lei` and `gluttony_licenses_lei`.
* `fancy_constraint`: the Fancy Constraint of *faire*-causatives gives the same cells.
* `resolved_person`: coordination resolves LEI to second person on its interpretable value and to
  third on its agreement value.
* `usted_accusative`, `sie_accusative`: Spanish USTED and German SIE show the effect.
* `assumed_identity`: under the German assumed-identity restriction, an exponence effect, SIE
  behaves as third person plural.

## Implementation notes

As in the paper, the rejection by some Weak-PCC speakers of a first person dative over accusative
LEI is left open (`first_dative_lei`). The Person Licensing Condition, the clitic logophoric
restriction, and the rival accounts of polite pronouns by impoverishment or by unmarked-value
recruitment have no formal counterpart here.
