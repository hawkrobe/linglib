# Barker (2002): Continuations and the nature of quantification

This file formalizes Barker's continuized grammar. A continuation is what the rest of the
sentence does with a constituent's value, and continuizing a grammar hands every constituent its
continuation. Noun phrases then come out as generalized quantifiers, *everyone* and *someone* can
be stated in situ, and they take scope without movement, storage or type-shifting. A rule with
two daughters continuizes in two ways, one per priority order of the daughters, which is where
scope ambiguity comes from. A scope island hands its continuation the finished clause, and
coordination distributes its continuation over the conjuncts.

A derivation is a tree over the direct grammar with each binary node marked for priority.
`Deriv.continuize` is the Continuation Schema, `Deriv.direct` the meaning the direct grammar
assigns, and `Deriv.scopeOrder` the order in which the quantificational items take scope. The
Simulation Theorem (`Deriv.continuize_eq_pure`) says that a derivation the direct grammar
interprets denotes its direct meaning, and Integrity (`Deriv.Constituent.scopeOrder_isInfix`)
that the quantifiers of a constituent are contiguous in the scope order of the sentence.

## Implementation notes

* The paper states the schema for rules of any arity, with one continuized rule per permutation
  of the daughters. Its grammar has rules of arity at most two, and so does `Deriv`.
* The expository determiners, which apply to the continuized nominal, are `Deriv.bind` at a
  generalized-quantifier denotation. The determiners of the final grammar quantify over correct
  choice functions.
* Transitive verbs take the object first, so `saw m j` is *John saw Mary*.

## TODO

The paper calls the four scopings of *someone saw a friend of everyone* logically distinct. The
restrictor of *a* contains the variable that *everyone* binds, so by
`Reference.CF.exists_isCorrect_forall_iff` the two scopings that differ in the order of *a* and
*everyone* are equivalent (`a_everyone_iff_everyone_a`), and the grammar gives the sentence two
truth conditions. A wide-scope *a friend* common to everyone is not among them.
