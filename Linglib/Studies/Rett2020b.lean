# Rett (2020): Separate but equal: a typology of equative constructions

This file formalizes the chapter's semantic typology of equatives. Descriptively, languages
mark an equative by a relativizer standard marker with or without a parameter marker, by a
predicate meaning *equal* or an adverbial meaning *equally*, by conjoined clauses, by a
case-marked standard, or by dedicated morphemes, `Strategy`. Three diagnostics sort these into
the classes of Figure 3, `Class`: predicative equatives have no weak *at least* reading;
implicit equatives, the standard-marker-only relatives and the conjoined ones, are evaluative;
and explicit equatives, whose parameter is marked, split into the sufficientive ones, which
factor modifiers like *twice* can modify, and the demonstrative ones, which they cannot. The
class semantics of section 5 derive the first two diagnostics: the sufficientive equative
relates degree sets by inclusion, `sufficientive_iff`, the demonstrative one predicates the
standard's maximal degree of the target, `demonstrative_iff`, so both hold when the target
exceeds the standard and neither mentions a standard of tallness, while the implicit equative
equates two evaluative properties, `implicit_evaluative`, and the predicative one an equality,
`not_predicative_of_lt`. Modifiability is the chapter's claim that only the sufficientive
strategy involves degree quantification. The examples of sections 3 and 4 are checked against
Figure 3, `judgment_iff_expected`, and the sufficientive is the equative `μ b ≤ μ a` read at
extent sets, `sufficientive_iff`.

## Implementation notes

The descriptive strategies split the parameter-marked relatives into sufficientive and
demonstrative as section 4.3 does; case-marked and dedicated strategies have no class, as the
chapter leaves them for future research. The Slovenian cells of Figure 2 that the chapter
leaves uncertain have no rows.

of exceeding the standard of comparison `s`. -/

than the standard of comparison, the predicative, sufficientive and demonstrative equatives hold
while the implicit one fails. -/
