# Sprouse, Wagers and Phillips (2012): A Test of the Relation Between Working-Memory Capacity and Syntactic Island Effects

This file formalizes the logic of [sprouse-et-al-2012]'s test of the resource-limitation
theory of island effects. An island effect is defined factorially, over the four sentences
that cross the presence of an island structure with the position of the gap: it is the
superadditive interaction, the drop in acceptability from combining a long-distance
dependency with an island structure exceeding the sum of the drops for each alone, and it is
measured by the differences-in-differences score (`dd`, `superadditive_iff_dd_pos`). The
simplest reductionist theory, on which a dependency cost and a structure cost add, predicts
additivity and so no island effect (`dd_linear`). The resource-limitation theory of
[kluender-kutas-1993] adds an overload penalty when the two processes, deployed
simultaneously, exceed a limited capacity, so its interaction is the penalty
(`dd_resourceLimitation`), decreasing in capacity and vanishing once capacity suffices
(`dd_resourceLimitation_antitone`, `dd_resourceLimitation_eq_zero`); a grammatical theory
penalizes the island-violating sentence alone, so its interaction is the constraint's penalty
whatever the capacity (`dd_grammatical`). The two theories part on whether the interaction
covaries with working-memory capacity across speakers, the prediction the paper tests.

## Implementation notes

Ratings are values in an ordered field, one per cell of the design, as for a speaker's mean
ratings; the score of the paper's (8) is the interaction contrast, and the linking hypothesis
that costs lower acceptability is the sign convention of the models. The overload penalty is
any function of capacity, with the theory's assumptions, that it is nonnegative, decreasing
in capacity, and zero when capacity covers both costs, as hypotheses. The two experiments,
over three hundred speakers on four island types, with seven-point and magnitude-estimation
ratings and serial-recall and n-back measures of capacity, found no relation between
capacity and the interaction and no structure cost for complex NP and subject islands; the
results and their resampling analyses are not formalized.
