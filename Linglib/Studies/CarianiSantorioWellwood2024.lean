# Cariani, Santorio and Wellwood (2024): Confidence Reports

Cariani, Santorio and Wellwood give adjectival *confident* and nominal *confidence* one
denotation, a property of confidence states. Each state carries a proposition as its theme, and
a background ordering ranks a holder's states. *σ is confident that p* says that some state of
σ's with theme `p` lies at or above a contrast state, and *certain* is the same ordering with
the contrast state at the top. The comparative instead compares degrees, assigned by a measure
that preserves the strict ordering. This is the two-component analysis of
`Semantics/Degree/Background.lean`, and the file sorts the paper's inferences by whether they use
the ordering or the degree scale.

## Main statements

* `exists_conjunctionFallacy`, `image_Ici_ne_ge_over`: confidence in a conjunction without
  confidence in its conjunct is consistent with the semantics, and with no threshold on a
  probability measure.
* `image_Ici_subset_image_Ici_iff_isMax`: *confident* entails *certain* exactly when its contrast
  state is maximal.
* `not_maxComparative_of_isMax`: nothing is more confident than a certainty, when the measure
  also respects ties.

## Implementation notes

* A holder's confidence states form a type `S` with its background preorder, and `θ : S → Set W`
  assigns themes; the states of all holders are the disjoint sum `Σ a, S a`.
* The positive form is `p ∈ θ '' Set.Ici c` for a contrast state `c`, *certain* is
  `p ∈ θ '' {s | IsMax s}`, and the comparative is `Degree.MaxComparative .gt (θ · = p) (θ · = q) μ`
  for `StrictMono μ`.
* Totality of the ordering is a hypothesis of the theorems that use it.
* The paper states no semantics for *doubt*, so (63c) is not formalized.

## TODO

* The conditional (59) under a contrast that maps a proposition to its negation, and the two
  objections to it, (60) and fn. 31. With the weak positive form (40) the entailment needs the
  `p`-state strictly above the `¬p`-state, since a tie satisfies (59a) and refutes (59b); the
  paper's gloss ("ranked higher") reads the contrast strictly.
* Conditional confidence (61), (62), with the ordering indexed by an information state.

/-! ### The comparative and the positive form -/

omit [Preorder S] in
/-- With one state per theme, the comparative (47) compares the two states' measures, so σ's
confidence that `p` exceeds the than-clause degree (37). -/
theorem maxComparative_theme_iff (hθ : θ.Injective) (s t : S) :
    MaxComparative .gt (θ · = θ s) (θ · = θ t) μ ↔ μ t < μ s := by
  simp only [hθ.eq_iff]
  exact maxComparative_eq_iff μ s t

/-- Upward monotonicity (53) holds over the region above a contrast state. If σ is confident
that `p` and more confident of `q` than of `p`, then σ is confident that `q`. -/
example [@Std.Total S (· ≤ ·)] (hμ : StrictMono μ) {c : S} {p q : Set W}
    (hp : p ∈ θ '' Ici c) (h : MaxComparative .gt (θ · = q) (θ · = p) μ) : q ∈ θ '' Ici c :=
  mem_image_of_maxComparative (isUpperSet_Ici c) hμ hp h

/-! ### The conjunction fallacy (52) -/

/-- (52a) *John is not confident that Linda is a bankteller* and (52b) *John is confident that
Linda is a feminist bankteller* are true together. Whenever `φ ∩ ψ` differs from `φ`, a two-state
total ordering with the `φ ∩ ψ`-state above the `φ`-state and the contrast state at the top
makes the holder confident of the conjunction but not of the conjunct. -/
theorem exists_conjunctionFallacy {φ ψ : Set W} (h : ¬ φ ⊆ ψ) :
    ∃ θ : Bool → Set W, φ ∩ ψ ∈ θ '' Ici true ∧ φ ∉ θ '' Ici true := by
  refine ⟨fun b ↦ if b then φ ∩ ψ else φ, ⟨true, mem_Ici.2 le_rfl, rfl⟩, ?_⟩
  rintro ⟨b, hb, hbφ⟩
  obtain rfl : b = true := top_le_iff.1 hb
  exact h (by simpa using hbφ.symm ▸ inter_subset_right (s := φ) (t := ψ))

/-- A holder confident of a conjunction but not of its conjunct is confident of no set of
propositions that the threshold account of §2 (7) delivers. Whatever the threshold, the
propositions whose probability meets it are closed under conjunction elimination, since a
measure is monotone. -/
theorem image_Ici_ne_ge_over [MeasurableSpace W] (P : Measure W) (t : ℝ≥0∞) {c : S}
    {φ ψ : Set W} (h₁ : φ ∩ ψ ∈ θ '' Ici c) (h₂ : φ ∉ θ '' Ici c) :
    θ '' Ici c ≠ Comparison.ge.over P t :=
  fun h ↦ h₂ (h ▸ Comparison.mem_ge_over_of_le P (h ▸ h₁) (measure_mono inter_subset_left))

/-! ### *Certain* and *confident* (§5.2) -/

/-- *Certain* entails *confident* (65b), (66b). The paper's reason is that *certain* picks out a
smaller segment of the ordering than *confident*, which is `Ici_subset_Ici` once *confident*'s
contrast state lies below *certain*'s; on a total ordering that holds of every contrast state
once *certain*'s is maximal. -/
theorem image_Ici_subset_image_Ici_of_isMax [@Std.Total S (· ≤ ·)] {m : S} (hm : IsMax m)
    (c : S) : θ '' Ici m ⊆ θ '' Ici c :=
  image_mono (Ici_subset_Ici.2 ((total_of (· ≤ ·) c m).elim id fun h ↦ hm h))

/-- The entailment is asymmetric (65a), (66a). When *confident*'s contrast state `c` is not
above *certain*'s `m`, the holder is confident but not certain of `c`'s theme. -/
theorem not_image_Ici_subset_image_Ici (hθ : θ.Injective) {c m : S} (hmc : ¬ m ≤ c) :
    ¬ θ '' Ici c ⊆ θ '' Ici m :=
  fun h ↦ hmc (Ici_subset_Ici.1 ((image_subset_image_iff hθ).1 h))

/-- *Confident* entails *certain* exactly when its contrast state is itself maximal, so (65a) is
consistent only on a contrast state below the top. *Confident* measures on an ordering with
maximal elements (69) without taking them as its standard. -/
theorem image_Ici_subset_image_Ici_iff_isMax [@Std.Total S (· ≤ ·)] (hθ : θ.Injective) {m : S}
    (hm : IsMax m) {c : S} : θ '' Ici c ⊆ θ '' Ici m ↔ IsMax c := by
  rw [image_subset_image_iff hθ, Ici_subset_Ici]
  exact ⟨hm.mono, fun hc ↦ (total_of (· ≤ ·) m c).elim id fun h ↦ hc h⟩

open English.Adjectives in
/-- The English fragment agrees with Figure 3, in which *confident* and *certain* measure on one
upper-closed scale, *certain* at its maximum and *confident* at a contextual standard. -/
example : confident.dimension = certain.dimension ∧ confident.scaleType = .upperClosed ∧
    certain.standard = .maxEndpoint ∧ confident.standard = .contextual := by
  decide

/-- On a total ordering the region above a maximal contrast state (71) is the set of maximal
states, what *certain* denotes in Figure 3. -/
theorem Ici_eq_setOf_isMax [@Std.Total S (· ≤ ·)] {m : S} (hm : IsMax m) :
    Ici m = {s | IsMax s} := by
  ext s
  exact ⟨fun hs t hst ↦ (hm (hs.trans hst)).trans hs,
    fun hs ↦ (total_of (· ≤ ·) m s).elim id fun h ↦ hs h⟩

/-- Nothing is more confident than a certainty (68). If σ is certain that `p`, σ is not more
confident of any `q` than of `p`. Admissibility (21) is not enough, since it leaves tied maximal
states free to be measured apart; the measure must also be monotone. -/
theorem not_maxComparative_of_isMax [@Std.Total S (· ≤ ·)] (hμ : Monotone μ) {s : S}
    (hs : IsMax s) {p q : Set W} (hsp : θ s = p) : ¬ MaxComparative .gt (θ · = q) (θ · = p) μ :=
  fun h ↦
    let ⟨y, _, hlt⟩ := h.exists_lt hsp
    (hμ ((total_of (· ≤ ·) y s).elim id fun h ↦ hs h)).not_gt hlt

/-- Under admissibility alone (68) fails, since a maximal state measured below another state
makes σ certain of its theme and more confident of the other's. -/
theorem maxComparative_of_isMax (hθ : θ.Injective) {s t : S} (hs : IsMax s) (hlt : μ s < μ t) :
    θ s ∈ θ '' {s | IsMax s} ∧ MaxComparative .gt (θ · = θ t) (θ · = θ s) μ :=
  ⟨⟨s, hs, rfl⟩, (maxComparative_theme_iff hθ t s).2 hlt⟩

/-- Two tied maximal states, as at the top of Figure 3, can be measured apart by an admissible
measure, since with every state tied every measure is admissible. The preorder is passed explicitly,
since `Bool`'s own order would otherwise be found. -/
example :
    let tied : Preorder Bool := Preorder.lift fun _ ↦ ()
    @StrictMono _ _ tied _ Bool.toNat ∧ @IsMax _ tied.toLE false ∧
      Bool.toNat false < Bool.toNat true :=
  ⟨fun _ _ h ↦ absurd h (lt_irrefl ()), fun _ _ ↦ trivial, Nat.zero_lt_one⟩
