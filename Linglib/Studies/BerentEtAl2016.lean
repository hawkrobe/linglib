# Berent et al. (2016): The double identity of linguistic doubling

This file formalizes the account of doubling by Berent, Bat-El, Brentari, Dupuis and
Vaknin-Nusbaum. A doubled form XX has two parses. As a single morpheme it contains two
identical constituents, which the Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP) bans. As a base
followed by its copy it is morphological reduplication, which languages favour. In twelve
experiments speakers disliked doubled novel words and novel ASL signs presented in
isolation, and preferred them once doubling was linked to the meaning of a taught base.
English speakers preferred doubled signs as plurals and not as diminutives, while Hebrew
speakers, whose reduplication marks diminution and never plurality, showed the opposite
pattern.

The authors' formal analysis has two constraints and no ranking. At the phonological
level XX violates the OCP and the control XY does not. At the morphological level the copy
escapes the OCP, which operates within a morpheme, and satisfies DEP, the ban on output
material without an input correspondent, which XY violates by adding material to the base.
Here both violation patterns are computed from the parses, over any type of prosodic
constituent. The winner at each level harmonically bounds its competitors, so the
predictions hold under both rankings.

## Main definitions

* `Parse`: a name as a single morpheme or as a base followed by its copy.
* `ocp`, `dep`: the OCP within each morpheme, and DEP against the taught base.
* `Level`, `tableau`: the level of analysis, and the competition it induces between a
  doubled name and its control.
* `SpokenLanguage`, `SpokenLanguage.Licenses`: the meanings a language marks
  morphologically and by reduplication, and the two transfer conditions on a morphological
  parse of doubling.

## Main results

* `Parse.surface_reduplicated`: the two parses of doubling share a surface form.
* `optimal_phonology`, `optimal_morphology`: the control wins at the phonological level and
  the reduplicative parse at the morphological level, under every ranking.
* `SpokenLanguage.licenses_iff`: a language licenses a meaning when it reduplicates for it,
  or reduplicates for nothing and marks it otherwise.
* `exists_optimal_surface_iff`: doubling is preferred exactly for the licensed meanings.
* `english_licenses_iff`, `hebrew_licenses_iff`, `licenses_not_monotone`: English licenses
  the plural alone and Hebrew the diminutive alone, although Hebrew morphology extends
  English morphology on both dimensions.

## Implementation notes

The control XY is a single morpheme at both levels, and DEP counts the constituents of a
name's stem beyond the taught base. With no base taught a name is its own input, so DEP is
vacuous. The reduplicative parse competes only at the morphological level, where the input
contains the reduplicative morpheme. Negative evidence against reduplication for a meaning
is read as the language reduplicating for other meanings only. The illicit conditions,
where the base and the doubled form name objects of different kinds, are not modelled.
