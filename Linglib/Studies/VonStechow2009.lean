# von Stechow (2009): Tenses in compositional semantics

Von Stechow gives English tense a compositional semantics. The Present denotes the speech time;
the Past is indefinite, an existential quantifier over the times before its local evaluation
time, and so is the auxiliary *have*; *will* is its mirror image and *be* passes its time on.
Against Partee's referential Past, the indefinite Past restricted to the times the speaker has
in mind gives the truth conditions of her stove sentence and, unlike the referential one, lets
negation and quantifiers scope over tense. Relative-clause tenses are bound pronouns, attitude
complements are properties of times, and *before* and *after* take the earliest time of their
clause. Along the way he argues that achievements need moments but not discrete time.

A time is a moment, a point of a linear order, or an interval of moments, mathlib's
`NonemptyInterval`, whose `≤` is the subinterval relation. A tense is possibility `◇` along its
cell read as a relation (`Semantics/Tense/Quantificational.lean`), so `◇[toSetRel ⟦past⟧] P s`
says that `P` held at some time before `s`.

## Main statements

* `not_dowtyAchievement`, `achievement_rat`: Dowty's interval semantics for achievements is
  unsatisfiable in dense time, von Stechow's moment semantics is not.
* `not_perfAdv_yesterday`: the present perfect with *yesterday* is contradictory.
* `every_sunday`: *John worked on every Sunday* is true on the reading restricted to past
  Sundays, and false on both unrestricted scopings, of a calendar where John works on Sundays.
* `restrictedPast_Iic_iff_prfv`: the Past restricted to the subintervals of a past time is the
  perfective at that time.
* `exists_not_prfv_past`: *It didn't rain today* is too weak on the referential analysis.
* `anaphoric_report_iff`: on the anaphoric analysis *At five Mary thought it was six* ascribes
  inconsistent beliefs to Mary.
* `before_earliest_iff_beforeEver`, `after_earliest_iff_after`: *before* and *after* the earliest
  time of the clause are Anscombe's *before ever* and *after*.

## Implementation notes

The tense entries, relative clauses, attitudes and adjunct clauses are stated on moments, the
arguments about the perfective, frame adverbials and the extended now on intervals, where
*before* is `NonemptyInterval.precedes`; *on* and *in* are `≤`, *at* is equality. The
referential Past (47), which von Stechow takes from Heim, is the presupposition
`Perspective.Presup ⟦past⟧`; the Perfective (50) and the extended-now perfect (28) are
`Aspect.PRFV` and `Aspect.PERF`, and quantization (12) is Krifka's `Mereology.QUA`. The printed
restricted Past (53) compares the quantified time with the speech time where its λ-bound
argument is meant, as (57) shows; the printed EARLIEST (91) requires the earliest time to
precede every time of the clause, itself included, and is read as `IsLeast`. Doxastic
alternatives are relations on worlds indexed by times, or on world–time pairs. Feature
transmission, PRO movement, the deletion of tenses under tenses, the progressive and the
operators THR, ST and EV are not formalized. The examples are the rows of
`Data.Examples.VonStechow2009`.
