# Denić (2023): Probabilities and logic in implicature computation

This file formalizes the two puzzles with embedded disjunction of [denic-2023] and their
resolution. *All 20 of Mary's friends are French or Spanish* preferably triggers the
distributive inferences that at least one is French and at least one is Spanish, while *Both of
Mary's friends are French or Spanish* preferably triggers ignorance about them, (6) and (7), and
fewer disjuncts likewise favour the distributive reading, (8) and (9). Under the exhaustification
of [fox-2007], the distributive reading arises when only the disjunction activates its
alternatives, ALT-or, all of which are innocently excludable, and the ignorance reading when the
quantifier does too, ALT-all-or, none of whose alternatives is, (26); since the alternatives
stand in the same entailment relations for any domain size, §3.2, no theory on which
implicatures are a function of entailment can distinguish the two sentences, and the pruning
constraints of [fox-katzir-2011] do not either, §3.3. The proposal, (30), is that an alternative
is pruned the more likely it is given the utterance: with each individual one of the m
properties at random, the probability that some of n individuals is A given that all are one of
the m is `1 − ((m − 1)/m)^n`, increasing in n and decreasing in m, and larger than that of the
universal alternative once n > 1, the assumptions of §4; a threshold on it prunes the existential
alternatives of (6) and (8) but not of (7) and (9). The deviance puzzle, §5, is that *#Each of
those three girls is Mary, Susan, or Jane* is degraded where *is called* is not: the identity
predicate is singleton-denoting, so given common knowledge the three names are borne by the three
girls one each, every existential alternative is settled, and the ignorance inferences the
sentence triggers contradict common knowledge, (40), the blindness of [magri-2009] extended from
scalar to ignorance inferences. Informativeness must then be computed blindly too, §7.3: given
common knowledge the existential alternatives of the deviant sentence are certain and would be
pruned, whereas blind to it their probability lies below every threshold that resolves the
inference puzzle.

## Implementation notes

Worlds assign each of the n individuals exactly one of the m properties, the uniform prior of
§4's assumptions; the prejacent *all are one of them* is then every world, and the conjunctive
alternatives of the chapter's footnote 8, which it sets aside, are unsatisfiable. The
exhaustification results are the substrate's innocent exclusion over sets of worlds, stated for
every n ≥ 2 and m ≥ 2, the distributive reading itself for two disjuncts. Probabilities are the
uniform measure `uniformOn` on reals. The mapping from conditional probability to pruning, which
the chapter leaves open between a linear and a threshold form, is taken as a threshold. Ignorance
inferences are the pragmatic ones of §3.1, about every alternative the exhaustified utterance
leaves open, so the grammatical parse of §7.1 is not modelled. The modified-numeral cases of
[buccola-haida-2019], (43), and the symmetry, modal and downward-entailing challenges of §8 are
recorded in the data only.
