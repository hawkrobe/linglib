# Farkas and Bruce (2010): On Reacting to Assertions and Polar Questions

This file formalizes [farkas-bruce-2010]'s account of why reactions to assertions and to polar
questions overlap only in part. The context structure is `Commitment.Table`: the participants'
discourse commitments, the common ground, and the Table, whose items project the common
grounds that would settle them. A default assertion commits its author, places the declarative
on the Table and projects confirmation alone (9); a default polar question places the
interrogative on the Table and projects both resolutions (12). So an assertion leaves the
common ground as it was, unlike [stalnaker-1978]'s update (`Table.commonGround_assert`,
`assert_not_narrowing`);
the two moves differ in whether the author is committed and in whether the projected set is
inquisitive (`projectedSet_assert`, `projectedSet_polarQuestion`), and agree in deciding the
sentence radical in every projected common ground (`Table.mem_of_mem_projectedSet_assert`,
`Table.mem_or_compl_mem_of_mem_projectedSet_polarQuestion`). Confirmation (16) followed by the
common-ground increase `M'` (17) settles an assertion (`shared_assert_confirm`,
`isStable_settle_assert`, `mem_commonGround_settle`); a total denial (22) leaves nothing
consistent projected and the conversation in crisis (21, `Table.inCrisis_assert_assert_compl`), from
which agreeing to disagree (23) recovers with the commitments intact
(`not_inCrisis_agreeToDisagree`,
  `discourseCommitments_agreeToDisagree`). A reverse answer to a polar question
(28) is no crisis (`not_inCrisis_polarQuestion_assert_compl`), a confirming answer (24)
projects the single common ground with the answer (`projectedSet_polarQuestion_assert`), and
the questioner's confirmation of it settles the question (`isStable_settle_polarQuestion`).

§4.3 and §5 classify responding assertions by two features: the relative polarity [same] or
[reverse] of the response to the sentence radical on the Table (31) and the absolute polarity
[+] or [−] of the asserted sentence. `Sentence` is a radical with its polarity and
`Confirming`/`Reversing` the move types (26) and (29) on sentences; the same [reverse] response
is a denial after an assertion and a reverse answer after a question
(`inCrisis_reversing_assert`, `not_inCrisis_reversing_polarQuestion`); on the responses of
`Discourse.Response` the relative polarity is the quotient of the two polarities
(`Reversing.iff_relative_eq_negative`).

§5.2 says what the polarity particles mark, as sets of responses: the English *yes* [same] or
[+] and *no* [reverse] or [−], their double duty (`english`); the Romanian *da* [+], *nu* [−]
and *ba* [reverse] except in a [reverse, −] answer to a question (`romanian`); and French *si*
and German *doch* the marked combination [reverse, +] (`reversePositive`). Both English particles
can confirm a negative question, while in Romanian only *nu* does
(`english_confirmsNegativeQuestion`, `romanian_confirmsNegativeQuestion_iff`). `rows` are the
responding assertions of (4), (5) and (35)–(50), whose particles are the fragments' polarity
particles; every acceptable response is one its English and Romanian particles mark
(`english_mem`, `romanian_mem`), *si* and *doch* occur in [reverse, +] responses only
(`si_doch_mem_reversePositive`), and *ba* is possible in every denial (`ba_denial`) and required
to be absent from a [reverse, −] answer (`ba_not_reverse_answer_neg`).

## Implementation notes

* The Table records the issue a sentence raises, not its syntactic object, so a negative polar
  question raises the same issue as its positive counterpart (15), `Question.polar_compl`, and
  the relative polarity of a response is computed from the sentences of the exchange rather
  than read off the Table.
* `M'` is `Table.settle`, which strips the shared proposition from the individual
  commitment lists as (17) prescribes; the projected set is derived from the Table rather than
  stored, as the paper notes it can be.
* Rows record the polarities of the initiating and responding sentences as a
  `Discourse.Response`; since a responding assertion shares its radical with the initiating
  sentence, [same] is agreement of polarity and [reverse] its reversal.
* The paper discusses only *si* of the French particles and only *doch* of the German ones, so
  what they mark is a named set rather than an interpretation of the whole fragment.

## TODO

* (5) accepts a bare *nu* denial of a positive assertion that (42) stars, so §5.2's claim that
  *ba* is required in a [reverse, −] denial is left as the weaker `ba_denial`.
* Example and section numbers follow the 2009 preprint; UNVERIFIED against the numbering of
  the journal version.
