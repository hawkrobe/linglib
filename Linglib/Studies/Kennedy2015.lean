# Kennedy (2015): A "de-Fregean" Semantics (and Neo-Gricean Pragmatics) for Modified and Unmodified Numerals

This file formalizes the de-Fregean semantics of Kennedy: a numeral, bare or modified,
is a quantifier over degree properties, true of a property when its greatest degree stands in
the numeral's relation to the number, `max{n | D(n)} = m` for the bare numeral ((29)), `> m` and
`< m` for the Class A modifiers *more than* and *fewer than* ((41)), `≥ m` and `≤ m` for the
Class B modifiers *at least* and *at most* ((42)); this is the substrate's degree quantifier
`Degree.MaxIn` at the comparison's interval. Applied to the degrees a count reaches it is the
comparison of the count, so bare numerals are two-sided without a Horn scale
(`maxIn_interval_Iic`), and the one-sided readings of numerals under root modals ((31)–(34)) are
matters of scope, `Degree.HighScope`: a bare numeral scoping over a necessity modal names the
least count the modal requires and over a possibility modal the greatest it allows
(`necessity_wide_iff`, `possibility_wide_iff`).

The two classes of Nouwen differ in the ordering they express ((4)), exclusive for
Class A and inclusive for Class B. Over the English modifiers, whose class the Fragment reads
off the construction, this is a fact about every reading, stated in Kamp's classes of modifiers:
a Class A reading is disjoint from the number's two-sided meaning and a Class B reading is
extensive (`classA_exclusive`, `classB_inclusive`).

The ignorance inferences of the Class B modifiers are Sauerland's primary implicatures ((43))
over Kennedy's single alternative set, the five forms of one numeral ((46)): *at least m* is
asymmetrically entailed by the bare numeral and by *more than m* and by no other alternative,
*at most m* by the bare numeral and *fewer than m* ((47)), while the bare numeral and the
Class A forms are entailed by no alternative at all (`interval_ssubset_iff`, `stronger_ge`,
`stronger_gt`, and the rest); and neither primary implicature of a Class B form
strengthens to a secondary one ((44)), each contradicting the assertion together with the other
(`not_isSecondaryImplicature_ge`, `not_isSecondaryImplicature_le`).

## Implementation notes

The worlds of the pragmatics are counts, so a form's content is the set `c.interval m` of counts,
the alternatives are the five forms of the numeral, one for each `Degree.Comparison`, and the
neo-Gricean operators are `NeoGricean.commitment` and `NeoGricean.IsSecondaryImplicature`. A
root modal is the quantifier `every R` or `GQ.some R` over its accessible worlds `R`, and
the numeral's two scopes are `Degree.LowScope` and `Degree.HighScope` of `MaxIn {m}` over it. The
interactions of Class B modifiers with root modals (Section 4.2) are not formalized.

(29), (41), (42): the numeral form `c m` is true of a degree property when its greatest degree
stands in the relation `c` to `m`, the substrate's `MaxIn (c.interval m)`. -/

/-- On the degrees a count reaches, the de-Fregean form is the comparison of the count itself,
the substrate's meaning of the numeral, two-sided bare content with no Horn scale. -/
