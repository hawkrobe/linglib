# Jansen and Pollmann (2001): On round numbers: Pragmatic aspects of numerical expressions

Jansen and Pollmann take a number's roundness to be its suitability for approximation, measured by
its frequency after *about* and its counterparts in four languages, and find it carried by
10-ness, 2-ness and 5-ness, with 2½-ness adding to frequency in general. They reach these
properties through two-number approximations, *about 5 or 6 books*: the pairs are consecutive
members of an arithmetic sequence whose first member and ratio are a power of ten, doubled, or
halved, and in their earlier rule also halved again. A single round number is a member of the
same sequences, among their first nine. They explain the inventory by a principle of favourite
quantities, doubling and halving, sometimes followed by halving again, being the basic means of
manipulating quantities.

Here the ratios are the powers of ten under those operations, in either rule (`Rule.IsRatio`),
a pair is two consecutive members of a sequence (`SeqPair`), and a single number is among the first
nine members of one (`FirstNine`). Among the first nine members of the revised rule's sequences
are exactly the numbers with 10-ness, 2-ness or 5-ness, and the quarter sequences of the original
rule add exactly 2½-ness.

## Main statements

* `firstNine_revised_iff`, `firstNine_original_iff`: the single round numbers are the members of
  the pair sequences, the quarter sequences adding 2½-ness.
* `seqPair_examples`, `pair_rows`: the paper's example pairs and the starred and unstarred
  phrases, against the rules.
* `not_isRatio_three_mul_pow`: no favourite quantity is three times a power of ten.

## Implementation notes

* Quantities are rational, since halving and quartering leave the integers (`½ × 10⁰`,
  `¼ × 10¹`); pairs and single numbers are natural, so only the natural ratios `10ⁿ`, `2 × 10ⁿ`,
  `5 × 10ⁿ` and `25 × 10ⁿ` bear on them (`isRatio_natCast_iff`).
* The kinds of `k`-ness are `Numerals.Roundness.Kness` at the paper's zeroth power, 2½-ness of
  `n` being 5-ness of `2n`.
* The rules are the paper's generalizations over corpus pairs, which they fit in 90.8 to 98.2
  percent of cases (p. 197); the theorems test them on the paper's examples.

## TODO

* The regressions of roundness and frequency on these properties (pp. 198–200) belong in
  `Data/Experiments`.
