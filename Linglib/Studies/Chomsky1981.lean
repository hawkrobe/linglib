# Chomsky (1981): the binding theory

This file formalizes the binding theory of Government and Binding as an instance of the
framework-neutral conditions of `Syntax/Binding`. A noun phrase binds another when the two are
coindexed and the first c-commands the second; an anaphor is bound in its governing category
(Principle A), a pronominal is free there (Principle B), and an R-expression is free
(Principle C). The positions are the noun phrases of a phrase-structure tree, the command
relation is Reinhart's c-command, the binding domain of a noun phrase is the minimal clause
containing it (`Syntax.Tree.clauseConfiguration`), the dependency is coindexation, and no
anaphor is exempt. An indexing is licit when coindexed noun phrases agree in φ-features
and it satisfies the three principles, and a tree is grammatical when some indexing is licit.

Since nothing is exempt, an anaphor that nothing in its clause c-commands is out under every
indexing, which excludes an anaphoric subject. For two noun phrases coindexed with each other
alone, Principle C is Reinhart's restriction (10b) read with c-command. The textbook paradigm
checks the instance: a reflexive object must corefer with its subject and agree with it, a
pronominal object cannot corefer with it, locality separates the two in an embedded clause, and
an R-expression cannot corefer with a c-commanding pronoun at any distance.

## Main definitions

* `Chomsky1981.configuration`: c-command and the minimal clause on the noun phrases of a tree.
* `Chomsky1981.Licit`, `Grammatical`, `CanCorefer`, `MustCorefer`.

## Main results

* `Chomsky1981.not_grammatical_of_not_locallyCommanded`: an anaphor with nothing in its clause
  c-commanding it rules the tree out.
* `Chomsky1981.permits_iff`: Principle C for a coindexed pair is Reinhart's restriction (10b).

## Implementation notes

A one-word noun phrase is a terminal of category `NP`, and the positions are those terminals.
The governing category is approximated by the minimal clause: the governor and the accessible
subject that refine it are not modelled, nor are noun phrases with subjects. Indexings range
over maps from the noun phrases to themselves, which realize every partition of them.

## TODO

The paradigm is the textbook one; check each sentence against Chapter 3 of the book, which was
not available, and move the verified ones to `Data/Examples`.
