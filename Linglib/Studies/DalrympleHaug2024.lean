# Dalrymple and Haug, constraints on reciprocal scope (2024)

A reciprocal in a complement clause has a narrow-scope we-reading and a wide-scope I-reading,
and Dalrymple and Haug survey constructions in which properties of its local antecedent, the
embedded pronoun rather than the matrix subject, fix the scope. On the quantificational
analysis of Heim, Lasnik and May the reciprocal contains a distributive quantifier that raises
to the scope position and binds the local antecedent in situ; on the relational analysis of
Haug and Dalrymple it is a pronoun anaphoric on the local antecedent, so that under wide scope
the local antecedent is bound by the matrix subject and interpreted with the reciprocal in the
matrix clause. Bound and nonbound antecedents, collective conjuncts and control constructions
come out alike on both analyses; an explicit distributor on the antecedent and a logophoric
antecedent separate them, and only the relational analysis fits the data.

We state each analysis by its two commitments, where it interprets the local antecedent under
each reading and whether the reciprocal distributes, derive the readings each admits for each
construction, and check them against the paper's judgments.

## Implementation notes

* A construction is represented by its local antecedent alone: the denotation its form or
  predicate forces, whether it is a logophor, the locus of an explicit distributor, and the
  number of the matrix argument. Partial control forces no denotation, since PRO may properly
  include the controller or coincide with it.
* A simple sentence has only the in-situ reading, so (18b)–(20) are the narrow reading with the
  distributor at the low locus.

## TODO

* (17) is analysed, with the paper, as exhaustive control, but `Landau2015.derivedControlTier`
  puts *intend* (and *decide* of (14)) on the partial-control tier; a semantics for partial
  control would decide the case.
* (25) is headed wide scope but read by the paper as a crossed reading; a crossed value in
  `Scope` would make it a row and reach the substrate's `ScopeReading.crossed`.
