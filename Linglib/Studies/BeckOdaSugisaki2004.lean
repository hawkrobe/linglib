# Beck, Oda and Sugisaki 2004: comparison in Japanese without degree abstraction

This file formalizes Beck, Oda and Sugisaki's analysis of Japanese *yori*-comparatives. A
*yori*-constituent denotes an individual — a free relative, or a definite built from a
relative clause — and fixes the standard `c` of a positive or contextual comparative in the
main clause, in place of the *than*-clause degree set of the standard analysis. The authors
attribute the difference to a Degree Abstraction Parameter: Japanese does not bind degree
variables in the syntax. We state both repertoires of denotations and derive from them the
paper's three empirical differences — variable acceptability, no subcomparatives of degree,
no degree-based negative islands — and its scope argument.

## Main definitions

* `er`: the comparative morpheme on degree sets, `max D₂ > max D₁`.
* `pos`: the positive form at a standard `c`; the contextual comparative is
  `Degree.maxIn (Set.Ioi c)`.
* `theC`: the Fregean definite over a contextual domain, the denotation of a *yori*-clause.
* `erJ`: the comparative that combines directly with the adjective meaning.

## Main results

* `pos_comparedTo`, `maxIn_Ioi_Iic_iff`: a context setter supplying `y` turns the positive form
  and the contextual comparative into the comparison with `y`.
* `isGreatest_card_of_isMaximal`: an amount standard is the cardinality of the maximal
  plurality.
* `pos_ne_subcomparative`: an individual standard lies on the matrix dimension and does not
  express a subcomparative of degree.
* `not_er_nobody`, `yori_negative_entails_unbought`: the negated *than*-clause has
  no maximum on an unbounded scale, while the definite *yori*-clause is defined and entails
  a particular unbought individual.
* `er_everyone_without_shared_book`: the standard comparative lacks the definite's
  uniqueness presupposition.
* `erJ_iff_pos`, `exists_wideScope_not_inSitu`: `erJ` has the truth conditions of the
  positive form and, applied in situ, yields only the narrow reading under `need`.

Example numbers follow the journal article; the examples are typed in
`Data/Examples/BeckOdaSugisaki2004.json`.
