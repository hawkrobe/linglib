# Matthewson (2013): Gitksan Modals

This file formalizes the description of the Gitksan modal system in [matthewson-2013]. Gitksan
is a mixed system (Fig. 1): every modal is specified for modality type, epistemic or
circumstantial, and modal strength is encoded among the circumstantial modals, *da'aḵhlxw* and
*anooḵ* for possibility against *sgi* for (weak) necessity, but not among the epistemic clitics
*ima('a)* and *g̱at*, which are compatible with necessity and possibility contexts alike
([peterson-2010]). With the paper's lexical forces, existential for all but *sgi*,
[deal-2011]'s account of modals without scales predicts every modal's uses: the epistemics
share a force and so form no scale, and are used for both, while *sgi* is the scalemate of
*da'aḵhlxw* and *anooḵ*, and each circumstantial modal is used for its own force. The system
fills the empty diagonal of the classification of modal systems
by selectivity for type and for strength (Fig. 2), whose other cells English, St'át'imcets and
Javanese occupy in the fragments.

Each modal's force and flavours predict its judgments in the paper's contexts, with one
exception: *sgi* is rejected in the sneeze case, pure circumstantial strong necessity, though
volunteered for *we must all die*, of the same force and flavour. No set of force-flavour pairs
predicts the gap, so it is not one of modal strength, and the paper suggests *sgi* needs a
non-empty ordering source.

Gitksan modals are not inherently future-oriented, against the English analysis of
[condoravdi-2002]: the prospective *dim* is present exactly when the prejacent is
future-oriented, and it is obligatory with the circumstantial modals because they are
future-oriented. Every cell of Fig. 4, perspective by orientation, is attested. The
circumstantial possibility modal has no actuality entailment, its obligatory *dim* keeping it
out of the perfective configuration of [hacquard-2006].

## Implementation notes

* The paper is agnostic between [peterson-2010]'s analysis of *ima('a)* as a possibility modal
  strengthened by an ordering source and a possibility modal without a scale, as [deal-2011]
  analyses Nez Perce *o'qa*, the negation diagnostic (30) not separating them, and adopts what
  the two share, an existential quantifier over worlds. The prediction of the modals' uses
  follows [deal-2011]'s mechanism, which the paper raises for the circumstantial modals
  (§5.1); forces are compared on Fig. 1's two columns, weak necessity counting as necessity.
* The rows record the paper's flavour labels; its pure circumstantial and teleological readings
  are the library's circumstantial flavour. A row's force is recorded only where the paper
  labels the context's strength.
* The primed rows are the *dim*-less variants that the paper's #(dim) marks as infelicitous.

/-! ### The modal system (Fig. 1) -/

/-- The modals' lexical forces: *ima('a)* and *g̱at* introduce an existential quantifier over
worlds (§3.1–3.2), *da'aḵhlxw* and *anooḵ* are possibility modals, and *sgi* a (weak) necessity
modal (§4). -/
def lexicalForce (m : ModalItem) : ModalForce := if m = sgi then .necessity else .possibility

/-- Fig. 1 from the lexical forces: in an upward-entailing context each modal serves, on
[deal-2011]'s account, for exactly the forces it is used with. The epistemics have no
scalemate and serve for both; *sgi* shares its flavours with *da'aḵhlxw* and *anooḵ*, so each
of the three serves for its own. -/

/-! ### Force and flavour (§3, §4) -/

/-- Outside the sneeze case, a modal is accepted in a context exactly when it expresses the
context's force and flavour: the possibility modals are rejected in necessity contexts, (66)
and (80), and *anooḵ* in a pure circumstantial one, (79). -/

/-- *sgi* is volunteered in strong necessity contexts, (89), (92) and (100), and accepted in a
