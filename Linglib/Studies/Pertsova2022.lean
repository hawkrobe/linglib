# Pertsova (2022): A case for a binary feature underlying clusivity

[pertsova-2022] argues from a 270-language pronoun database that inclusive is a kind of first
person distinguished from the exclusive by a binary feature, against containment accounts in
which a privative [ADDRESSEE] makes the inclusive a superset of the exclusive. Her feature
hierarchy (4) places AUTHOR under +PARTICIPANT and ADDRESSEE under AUTHOR, so a language
activates PARTICIPANT, then AUTHOR, then ADDRESSEE, and the categories are the referent sets the
active feature values pick out (5). The hierarchy predicts which persons can be fully conflated:
activating PARTICIPANT, AUTHOR and ADDRESSEE in turn gives two, three and four persons, and
inclusive never conflates with second person, nor second with third, nor first with third (p.
402), conflation arising only from inactive features (p. 403). Against [harbour-2016] she argues
that his author bipartition, second with third against first, is doubtful for pronouns (pp.
425–426), and she grounds the priority of AUTHOR over ADDRESSEE in the privileged status of
speakers (p. 426).

## Main results

* `image_graph_active`: the active feature sets the hierarchy allows generate exactly four
  systems, monopartition, participant bipartition, tripartition and quadripartition.
* `graph_active_ne_authorBipartition`: none of them is Harbour's author bipartition.
* `no_partial_conflation`: inclusive conflates with second person only with the exclusive too,
  second with third only with the first too, and first with third only with the second too.

## Implementation notes

The features are those of `Harbour2016.ThreeFeature` on participant sets, ADDRESSEE being
[hearer]. With no feature active the hierarchy gives the monopartition, which the paper does not
discuss; it is included as the empty initial segment. Number is not modeled, so the referent sets
of (5) appear as their participant sets, *me+other(s)* as `{speaker}`. Pertsova's argument from
ABA patterns and derived exclusives (§§2.3, 5) needs vocabulary insertion with blocking and is
not formalized.
