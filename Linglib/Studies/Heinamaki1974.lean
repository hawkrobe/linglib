# Heinämäki (1974): Semantics of English Temporal Connectives

Heinämäki gives the truth conditions of the English temporal connectives in terms of the times at
which the two clauses hold. On run-time denotations they are relations between the clauses' time
traces: *A when B* asserts that the two hold at a common time (`when_`), *A while B* that every
time of `A` is a time of `B` (`while_`), *A whenever B* the converse containment (`whenever`),
*A since B* that some time of `B` lies at or before every time of `A` (`since`), and *A by B* that
some time of `A` lies at or before every time of `B` (`by_`). *Since* and *by* are the non-strict
counterparts of Anscombe's quantificational *before*, with the roles of the clauses exchanged, so
*before ever* entails *by* but not conversely (`before_by`, `by_not_before`). The existential
connectives commit the speaker to both clauses; the universal ones do so only given the clause
they quantify over, and are not symmetric (`while_not_symm`).
