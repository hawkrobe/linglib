# Shieber (1986): An Introduction to Unification-Based Approaches to Grammar

This file formalizes the information ordering of §3.2 on the token feature bundle
`Morphology.Features`, the depth-one, reentrancy-free fragment of the book's feature
structures. Every feature there is atomic-valued, so paths are single features and the
reentrancy clause of subsumption is vacuous: the definition of §3.2.2, that `D` subsumes `D′`
when `D(l)` subsumes `D′(l)` for every feature `l` of `D`, an atom neither subsuming nor
subsumed by a different one and the variable subsuming everything, is the product of the
flat orders, the bundle's `≤`, with the variable `[ ]` as `⊥`. Unification (§3.2.3) is the
most general structure both inputs subsume, failing on conflict: it succeeds exactly on
pairs bounded above and its value is their least upper bound, from which the book's example
laws follow, that unification adds information, is idempotent, has the variable as its
identity, is commutative, associative with failure propagating, and monotone. Generalization,
the most specific structure subsumed by both inputs, is total, the meet.

## Implementation notes

* The order, the partial join and the meet are the pointwise instances of
  `Core/Order/Bundle.lean`, `Core/Order/Flat.lean` and `Core/Order/PartialUnify.lean`, so each
  law is the generic lemma at `Features`. The subsumption lattice is not distributive: a
  feature with three values is the diamond, modular but not distributive, as [carpenter-1992]
  notes of feature-structure orders in general. Phrasal combination and reentrant structures
  are not formalized.
