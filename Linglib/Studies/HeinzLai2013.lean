# Heinz and Lai (2013): Vowel harmony and subsequentiality

Heinz and Lai place iterative vowel harmony in the subsequential hierarchy. Over the alphabet of
§3, harmonizing vowels `+` and `−`, an inert class `C` of consonants and transparent vowels, and
opaque vowels `⊞` and `⊟`, progressive harmony is computed left to right by the sequential
transducer of Figure 2, and regressive harmony by the same transducer run right to left. Sour
grapes harmony (8) is not left-subsequential (Theorem 5), and dominant–recessive harmony (9) is
subsequential in neither direction (Theorem 6), but it is weakly deterministic in the sense of
their Definition 1 (Theorem 7): progressive spreading of `+` alone, Figure 4, run left to right
and then right to left.

## Main definitions

* `Seg`: the alphabet of §3
* `ph`: progressive harmony, the transducer of Figure 2
* `IsSourGrapes`, `IsDominantRecessive`: the conditions (8) and (9)
* `php`: progressive spreading of `+` alone, the transducer of Figure 4

## Main results

* `ph_forms`: progressive harmony takes the Turkish genitives of Table 2 to their surface forms
* `not_isLeftSubsequential_of_isSourGrapes`: Theorem 5
* `exists_isRightSubsequential_isSourGrapes`, `not_isRightSubsequential_of_isSourGrapes`: the
  right half of Theorem 5 fails for (8) alone and holds once trigger-less words are left alone
* `not_isSubsequential_of_isDominantRecessive`: Theorem 6
* `isDominantRecessive_php`, `isWeaklyDeterministic_php`: Theorem 7

## Implementation notes

* The proof of Theorem 5 goes through the bounded delay of left-subsequential functions rather
  than the paper's sets of tails. The paper omits the right half as similar; it needs more than
  (8), since a right-to-left pass that raises every `−` unless the word ends in `⊟` meets (8).
* Theorem 7 is stated, as in the paper, for words over `+` and `−`.
* Not formalized: Theorem 4 (majority rules is not regular), the stem-control results
  (Theorems 8 and 9), and the conjecture that sour grapes is not weakly deterministic.
