# Stump (2006): Heteroclisis and paradigm linkage

This file formalizes Stump's account of heteroclisis, the property of a lexeme whose
paradigm contains forms built on stems of two or more inflection classes. A rule of paradigm
linkage gives a content cell of a lexeme a form correspondent built on one of the lexeme's
stems: the universal default assigns the root, and narrower language-specific rules override
it by Pāṇini's principle, assigning a coradical, a stem that differs from the root in form or
in inflection class. The paper's rules (5), (14), (15), (17) and (18) realize every form of the
Czech nouns in its Tables 1, 6 and 8, read from the forms data. The heteroclisis of Czech
PRAMEN is morphosyntactically conditioned, its inflection class fixed by the property sets its
cells express, whereas that of Sanskrit AHAN is morphologically conditioned, following a
pattern of alternation among Strong, Middle and Weakest stems. Stump's Sanskrit rules of
paradigm linkage (20a,b) "are independently motivated by the need to account for the pattern of
stem alternation in nonheteroclite paradigms such as the masculine and neuter paradigms of
PRATYAÑC" (p. 295): one list of rules gives the grades of PRATYAÑC's stems, which share a
declension, and the stems of AHAN, which do not. The paper measures how closely a heteroclite
paradigm's class boundary follows an inflectional category, and claims that the categories
serving as absolute correlates are privileged: every rule of paradigm linkage sensitive to some
category is sensitive to a privileged one.

## Main definitions

* `attested`: the forms of a Czech cell, every matching row of the forms data.
* `Stem`, `Entry`, `inferSoftMasc`: stems individuated by lexeme and declension, lexical
  entries, and the rule of stem inference (18).
* `CellRule`, `rulesFor`, `stemFor`: the rules of paradigm linkage (14), (15) and (17) as
  domain rules, resolved by the Elsewhere engine with the root of rule (5) as the fallback.
* `czRealize`, `czLinkage`: the realization of form cells and the Czech paradigm linkage.
* `degreeNum`, `degree`: the degree of correlation of a category with a class split.
* `IsAbsoluteCorrelate`, `IsMaximalCorrelate`, `IsCloven`, `IsFractured`,
  `IsIntersectiveCorrelate`: the paper's classification of heteroclite paradigms, over any
  cells pairing a case with a number.
* `SensitiveTo`, `Privileged`, `SatisfiesPCR`: the privileged category restriction.
* `SktForm`, `f₁`: Sanskrit form property sets and the property mapping (10).
* `strength`, `rule20a`, `rule20b`, `sktLinkage`: the strong and weak property sets of (19),
  the rules (20a,b), and the linkage of PRATYAÑC and AHAN.
* `hrdLinkage`, `matLinkage`: Sanskrit HṚD(AYA) and Russian MAT'.

## Main results

* `realize_matches_tables`: the rules realize every attested form of the nine Czech nouns.
* `heteroclite_iff`, `segments_invariant`, `pramen_suppletive`: PRAMEN, PŘEDSEDA, SLUHA and
  FILOLOG are heteroclite on form-identical stems, and heteroclisis is suppletion.
* `degreeNum_eq_card_iff`: a category is an absolute correlate exactly when the class split
  factors through it.
* `pramen_degrees`, `predseda_degrees`, `sluha_degrees`, `filolog_degrees`: the paper's figures.
* `isAbsoluteCorrelate_of_rules`: rules seeing only a category make it an absolute correlate.
* `pcr`, `not_satisfiesPCR_hypothetical`: the Czech rules satisfy (40), and a case-only rule
  would violate it.
* `fractured_minimal_intersective_privileged`: claim (39) for the Czech nouns.
* `rules_match_table9`, `rules_match_table10`: (19) and (20a,b) give PRATYAÑC's grades and
  AHAN's stems at every cell of Tables 9 and 10.
* `pratyanc_not_heteroclite`, `ahan_heteroclite`, `ahan_grade_eq_pratyancN`: one list of rules
  makes AHAN heteroclite and PRATYAÑC not, with the same grades.
* `ahan_degrees`, `ahan_fractured`: AHAN's paradigm is fractured, its case correlation .71.
* `hrd_cloven`, `privileged_case`, `pcr_skt`: case, the absolute correlate of HṚD(AYA)'s cloven
  paradigm, is privileged, and (20a,b) satisfy (40).
* `hrd_form_suppletive`, `mat_suppletive_not_heteroclite`: suppletion with and without
  heteroclisis.

## Implementation notes

PŘEDSEDA's root *předseda* and coradical *předsed* share the segments *předsed*, ŽENA's endings
being segmented after *žen-*. Endings are read off exemplars, chosen in Czech by animacy and a
final back obstruent, as the tables juxtapose SLUHA with FILOLOG and MUŽ, and in Sanskrit by
declension among PRATYAÑC, NĀMAN and MANAS; Czech palatalization is witnessed only for *h* and
*g*. Rules compete by domain inclusion, the rendering of Pāṇini's principle, and selection falls
back on the root, by (5) and (12). Gender is taken as lexical: PRATYAÑC's masculine and neuter
are two lexemes, clause (ii) of `f₁` is vacuous, and the feminine, whose ī-stem *pratīcī*
(n. 18) would make PRATYAÑC heteroclite, is left out, as are n. 21's stem indexing and n. 22's
alternants. Sanskrit sandhi (*aho-bhis*, *pratyag-*) is unstated, so no forms are built. Rows
are filtered by language.
