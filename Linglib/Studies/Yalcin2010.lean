# Yalcin (2010): Probability operators

Yalcin asks what formal structure the semantics of *probably*, *likely* and the comparative
*at least as likely as* requires, and runs three candidate semantics against a list of
inference patterns: the intuitively valid V1–V12, the invalid I1–I3, and the questionable
Conjunctivitis E1. Kratzer's relative likelihood account lifts the preorder an ordering source
induces on worlds to propositions by Lewis's clause; Hamblin's possibility space account
measures a proposition by its most possible world; the probability space account measures it
by a finitely additive probability. In the paper's verdict Kratzer's account validates V1–V10
but fails positive form transfer and validates Halpern's union property I1, whose special case
I2 collapses equiprobability into certainty; Hamblin's validates I1–I3 and Conjunctivitis; and
the probability space account validates V1–V12 and none of I1–I3 or E1.

## Implementation notes

* Each account is a likelihood relation on `Set W` with the comparative probability mixins, so
  most patterns come from `Logic/ComparativeProbability/Patterns` by instance resolution. V6
  and V7 take Kratzer's human necessity and possibility for his account and the quantifiers
  `A = Set.univ` and `A.Nonempty` over the epistemic space for the other two; V8–V10 take
  Kratzer's restricted necessity or, for probability, entailment.
* The refutations are the paper's: footnote 8's two tied worlds against V11, the coin against
  I1 and I2, the twelve-sided die against E1.
* Two of the paper's verdicts do not survive formalization. V12, which the paper counts among
  Kratzer's failures, follows from I2, which the paper shows the account validates
  (`kratzer_V12`); for the same reason it is no point of Hamblin's account over Kratzer's. And
  Hamblin's account, which the paper credits with V11, refutes it (`hamblin_refutes_V11`). The
  paper's claim that Kratzer's account does not validate Conjunctivitis is confirmed by a
  four-world countermodel (`kratzer_refutes_E1`).
* Section numbers and example labels follow the author's June 2010 draft in Zotero and are
  unverified against the Philosophy Compass pagination.
