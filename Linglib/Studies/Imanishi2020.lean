# Imanishi (2020): Parameterizing Split Ergativity in Mayan

This file formalizes [imanishi-2020], the journal account of the alignment puzzle of
[imanishi-2014]: the non-perfective clause of Kaqchikel, Chol and Q'anjob'al is an aspectual
predicate embedding a nominalized clause, yet Kaqchikel cross-references the subject with the
set B marker and the transitive object with set A, (4), where Chol and Q'anjob'al do the
reverse, (5). The Restriction on Nominalization (63), that nominalized verbs lack a
syntactically projected external argument, is the dissertation's requirement
(`Imanishi2014.URN`) restated as a selectional property of the nominalizing head. Under it a
transitive base must be independently intransitivized, by passivization, antipassivization or
(pseudo) noun incorporation (`Strategy`), and the subject is base-generated as the argument of
the matrix predicate (`Matrix`): absolutive from Infl under the intransitive *ajin*, inherent
ergative from transitive v under *chäp* 'begin'. A `Clause` records these choices, and
`Clause.subject` and `Clause.object` say what licenses each argument (`Licensing`): genitive
from the D of the nominalized clause goes to its highest Case-less DP, absolutive to the object
from Voice or from the Q'anjob'al suffix *-on*. `Clause.WellFormed` collects the conditions the
derivations rely on, among them the semantic control of the matrix subject into an external
θ-role of the base, which excludes unaccusative and passive bases under *ajin*, (92) and (94).
The summary (117) is `subjectMarker_setB_iff` and `objectMarker_setA_iff`, and `case_eq_caseOf`
shows that the progressive derivations assign the dissertation's Cases.

## Implementation notes

* That nominalized verbs of Kaqchikel must be intransitivized is not derived from the
  restriction, as the paper conjectures it may be; it is a clause of `WellFormed`.
* The closing generalization, that the restriction fails exactly when the verbal domain of the
  nominalized clause has a structural Case assigner, is not stated: in the dissertation's survey
  Tojolabal is low absolutive yet subject to the requirement, so the criterion cannot be read
  off `Mayan.ABSPosition`.
* The Case-licensing of the relational noun by the preposition *chi*, (87) and (88), and the
  third person set B marker for the nominalized clause on the aspectual predicate are outside
  the model.
