# Kratzer (1996): Severing the External Argument from its Verb

This file formalizes Kratzer's proposal that the external argument is not an argument of the
verb. A transitive verb denotes a relation between its internal argument and an event, and the
external argument is introduced by a separate functional head, Voice, whose denotation is a
thematic relation such as Agent. Voice and the verb phrase combine by Event Identification,
which conjoins the two at the event and leaves the introduced participant open, so that the
sentence *Mittie fed the dog* denotes the events that are feedings of the dog and of which
Mittie is the agent. Syntactically the external argument is the specifier of VoiceP, above the
verb phrase that contains the verb and its internal argument.

Because the external argument enters by Event Identification, the kind of event the verb
phrase describes constrains the role Voice can assign: an agent head is restricted to actions,
a holder head to states, and Event Identification of an agent head with a stative verb phrase
such as *own the dog* yields nothing (`agent_stative_eq_bot`).

## Implementation notes

Event Identification is `ArgumentStructure.eventIdentification`, and the agentive Voice head
is `Voice.agentive`; the derivation is stated for an arbitrary agent relation and verb. Kratzer's
Event Identification is undefined on inputs with disjoint sorts of events; the library's is
total, so the clash comes out as the empty relation. The tree is built from planar leaf tokens,
and the paper's structural claim is its c-command relations.
