# Karttunen (1977): Syntax and Semantics of Questions

This file formalizes the semantics of [karttunen-1977]: an indirect question denotes the set
of its true answers, the propositions among its alternatives that hold at the world of
evaluation, which is `Question.trueAnswers` of the question's Hamblin set. The yes/no rule
(26) gives *whether p* the alternatives `p` and its negation, so that at each world the
question denotes the singleton of the true one (`trueAnswers_pair`); the WH-quantification
rule (33) gives *which girl sleeps* one alternative per girl, so that the question denotes the
propositions that a sleeping girl sleeps, (34), and the empty set when no girl sleeps
(`trueAnswers_image_eq_empty_iff`), the existential implicature the paper leaves to
[karttunen-peters-1976] in its footnote 13. Since every member of the denotation is true, a
verb like *tell* is veridical with an indirect question where it is not with a *that*-clause,
(19) (`told_true`).

Footnote 11's meaning postulate relates the question-embedding *know* to the
proposition-embedding one: an agent knows a question when she knows each of its true answers,
and knows that it has none when it has none (`Knows`). The first conjunct is the substrate's
`Question.KnowsAnswer`, knowledge of the intersection of the true answers, and the second is
what keeps knowledge of an empty question from being trivial (`knows_iff_of_no_witness`).
Knowing *whether p* is knowing `p` where it holds and its negation elsewhere
(`knows_pair_iff`).

## Implementation notes

The substrate's `Question` is a downward-closed set of propositions whose alternatives
`Question.alt` are its maximal members, so `Question.polar` and `Question.which` reproduce
the paper's alternative sets only up to maximality: the polar identification holds for a
non-trivial proposition (`trueAnswers_alt_polar`) and the wh one when the answers form an
antichain (`trueAnswers_alt_which`). The paper's syntax, the proto-questions and the rules
building questions from them, is not represented, nor are the multiple-wh and scope
ambiguities of its later sections.
