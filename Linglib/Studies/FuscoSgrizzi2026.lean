# Fusco and Sgrizzi (2026): Belief or Action? Semantic Ambiguity in the Italian Non-finite Domain

This file formalizes [fusco-sgrizzi-2026]'s account of the belief and intention readings of
Italian *convincere* 'convince' with its two infinitival complements: *Marco ha convinto Gianni di
avere un figlio* reports a belief, *Marco ha convinto Gianni a avere un figlio* an intention.
Where [grano-2024] ties the alternation to mood and finiteness, the paper ties it to the size of
the complement. The *di*-infinitive is a CP: it hosts modal auxiliaries, allows subject as well
as object control, and can be assessed for truth. The *a*-infinitive stops below tense and above
vP: it hosts negation, passive and low aspectual verbs and forms a temporal domain of its own, but
blocks clitic climbing and subject control and cannot be assessed for truth. The readings follow
from the size through one lexical entry: *convincere* causes a rational-attitude state with the
property its complement supplies (`Frame.convincere`, the paper's (24)). A *di*-complement closes
the eventuality argument of the bare infinitive into a proposition, which *di* quantifies over
the state's content worlds; an *a*-complement keeps it open, and *a*, anchored to the state,
quantifies over the state's inertia worlds and binds the event to the state by the causal
relation (`aP`). Both heads are Kratzer necessity over backgrounds the state projects, the
event-relative modality of [hacquard-2010]: *di* over a content background, *a* over a
circumstantial base ordered by inertia ([dowty-1979], [kratzer-2013]). This is the causal
self-referentiality of intention ([searle-1983]): in every inertia world the intended event is
caused by the attitude state, hence later than it, the future orientation of *a*-infinitives
([wurmbrand-2014]; `intention_future`). Complement size is the extended projection's
`ComplementSize`, ordered by functional level; the reading is read off the CP threshold, and the
diagnostics of sections 3 and 3.1 are predicted by the heads the complement reaches
(`rows_predicted`).

## Implementation notes

* The *a*-infinitive is recorded with negation as its highest head, the highest the paper places
  inside it. The functional sequence does not separate negation from tense and modal heads, so
  the absence of modal auxiliaries ((9) and (10)) and the ban on past-oriented complements ((5))
  stay in the prose and in `intention_future`.
* The two heads are stated over abstract eventualities and worlds, with the content background,
  the circumstantial base and the inertial ordering as anchoring functions of the state. The
  closure head (23b) is `Event.closure` and the prejacent of *a* is `Event.causedClosure`, the
  operators of [grano-2024]'s account, so a complement takes its world before its eventuality.
* The examples are `Data.Examples.FuscoSgrizzi2026`; the lexical entries are those of
  `Fragments/Romance/Italian/Verbs.lean`.
