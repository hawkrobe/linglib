# Riggle (2009): Violation semirings in Optimality Theory

This file formalizes the paper's algebraic characterization of constraint violation. A
violation profile is a multiset over the constraint set, merge is multiset union, and
harmonic inequality under a ranking is the lexicographic order of the ranking's reading of
the profiles, `HarmonicLT`. The minimum under harmonic inequality and merge make the
violation semiring `V`, a tropical semiring over profiles with an infinitely bad profile as
the additive identity, whose commutative semiring structure is inherited from mathlib's
`Tropical`. The semiring is idempotent and monotone, `le_mul`: merging can only make a
profile worse, which is the principle behind shortest-path optimization that every piece of
an optimal mapping is itself optimal, `Optimal.left_of_add`. Merge commutes with every
ranking's reading, `smul_add`, so the merged violations of a constraint set are one object
for all rankings and a ranking enters only through the minimum. A Harmonic Grammar
weighting is a homomorphism of the merge monoids into the tropical semiring of costs,
`tropWeight`.

## Implementation notes

Profiles are `ViolationProfile n`, whose lexicographic order is harmonic inequality under
the identity ranking; a ranking reads a profile through the action of
`OptimalityTheory.Ranking`, as the tableau substrate does. The weighted same-length
transducers of the paper's sections 3 and 4, their intersection, and the complexity bound
of the H-Opt algorithm are not formalized.

/-! ### Harmonic inequality and merge -/

/-- Harmonic inequality (Definition 1) under a ranking: the ranking's reading of `A` is
lexicographically below that of `B`, so `A` has fewer violations of the highest-ranked
constraint on which the two differ. -/
def HarmonicLT (r : Ranking n) (A B : ViolationProfile n) : Prop := r • A < r • B

/-- Merge is ranking-independent (section 3): a ranking reads a merged profile as the merge
of its readings, so one merged constraint set serves every ranking. -/
theorem smul_add (r : Ranking n) (A B : ViolationProfile n) :
    r • (A + B) = r • A + r • B := rfl

/-- Merging the same profile on both sides preserves harmonic inequality. -/
theorem HarmonicLT.add_right {r : Ranking n} {A B : ViolationProfile n}
    (h : HarmonicLT r A B) (C : ViolationProfile n) : HarmonicLT r (A + C) (B + C) := by

/-- A profile is optimal in a set under a ranking when it belongs to the set and no member
is more harmonic. -/
def Optimal (r : Ranking n) (S : Set (ViolationProfile n)) (A : ViolationProfile n) : Prop :=
  A ∈ S ∧ ∀ B ∈ S, ¬ HarmonicLT r B A

/-- Dijkstra's principle for harmonic optimization (section 2): a merge that is optimal among
the merges of two sets has an optimal first part, so every piece of an optimal mapping is
itself an optimal mapping. -/

/-! ### The violation semiring -/

/-- The violation semiring (Example 2): profiles under the identity ranking together with
the infinitely bad profile `⊤`; tropical addition is the minimum under harmonic inequality,
tropical multiplication is merge, and the commutative semiring structure is mathlib's. -/
abbrev V (n : ℕ) := Tropical (WithTop (ViolationProfile n))

/-- Monotonicity (section 2): merging can only make a profile worse, so the semiring is
monotone in the sense that makes shortest-path optimization sound. -/
theorem le_mul (a b : V n) : a ≤ a * b := by
  rw [← untrop_le_iff, untrop_mul]

  induction untrop b using WithTop.recTopCoe with
  | top => exact le_top
  | coe x => exact WithTop.coe_le_coe.mpr (ViolationProfile.zero_le x)

/-- In semiring terms, the minimum of a profile and any merge extending it is the profile. -/
theorem add_mul_self (a b : V n) : a + a * b = a := add_eq_left (le_mul a b)

/-! ### Harmonic Grammar -/

/-- A weighting read as a homomorphism from the merge monoid of profiles to the additive
reals: the weighted violation sum. -/
def weightMap (w : Fin n → ℝ) : ViolationProfile n →+ ℝ where
  toFun v := weightedViolations w (ofLex v)
  map_zero' := by
    show ∑ i, w i * ((0 : ℕ) : ℝ) = 0
    simp
  map_add' a b := by
    simp only [weightedViolations, ← Finset.sum_add_distrib]
    exact Finset.sum_congr rfl λ i _ => by

      push_cast
      exact mul_add _ _ _

/-- The weighting maps the violation semiring to the tropical semiring of costs (section 2),
preserving tropical multiplication and the identities; whether it also preserves the minimum
is the question of Harmonic Grammar's agreement with Optimality Theory, which the paper
does not raise. -/
def tropWeight (w : Fin n → ℝ) : V n →* Tropical (WithTop ℝ) where
  toFun a := trop ((untrop a).map (weightMap w))
  map_one' := by simp
  map_mul' a b := by simp [untrop_mul, WithTop.map_add]

theorem tropWeight_zero (w : Fin n → ℝ) : tropWeight w 0 = 0 := by
