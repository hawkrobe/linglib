# Lamont, O'Hara and Smith (2019): Weakly deterministic transformations are subregular

Unbounded tonal plateauing turns every toneless unit between two high tones into a high tone, so
the fate of a target depends on material unboundedly far away on both sides. Heinz and Lai, and
Jardine after them, conjectured that such maps are not weakly deterministic. Lamont, O'Hara and
Smith show that plateauing is weakly deterministic in Heinz and Lai's sense (Figure 1). A
left-to-right pass that preserves length and alphabet rewrites every HLH as HHH, so that HLH
never survives it, and then writes HLH as a code for an H with another H to its left; a
right-to-left pass decodes it.

## Main definitions

* `markLeft`, `resolveRight`: the transducers A and B of Figure 1

## Main results

* `utp_map_eq_resolve_mark`: B after A computes plateauing
* `length_markLeft_run`: A preserves length
* `utp_isWeaklyDeterministic`: plateauing is weakly deterministic

## Implementation notes

* A toneless unit is `Tone.TBU.O`, the paper's L. Since `SubsequentialTransducer.runRight`
  reverses the run, B's blocks are written reversed. The figure gives B no H transition from
  `q4`; A never writes an H there, and B keeps it.
* The proof splits a word into Ls, an H, blocks `Lʲ H`, and Ls. A writes each block as H, HH or
  `Lʲ⁻² HLH`, and B, reading right to left, holds back at most one H.
* Not formalized: §2, where first-last plateauing and double-edged spread are shown regular but
  not weakly deterministic by a counting argument, and the characterization of Theorem 3.1.
