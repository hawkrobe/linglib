# Embick (2015): The Morpheme: A Theoretical Introduction

This file formalizes [embick-2015]'s procedure of Vocabulary Insertion in a complex head: insertion
proceeds from the inside out (§4.5, the condition (C3) of §7.3), substitutes an exponent for the
Q variable of each functional morpheme (§4.2), leaves the morpheme's synsem features in place
(§4.2.2), and lets a contextual item see the concatenated neighbours of its morpheme, null
exponents pruned (§7.3.2). The procedure is the substrate's `ComplexHead.insertAll`, and this file
runs it on the book's own material. The fragment of the Latin conjugation (§4.6) derives the four
tenses of *laudāre* in (40) from the Vocabulary Items (36), (37) and (42): the perfect-specific
agreement endings are inserted only where the deleted T[−past] leaves Agr concatenated with
Asp[perf], the overt tense of the pluperfect intervening (§7.3.2.1), and the first singular *-m*
of the imperfect and pluperfect reads T[+past]. Under rewriting, where insertion deletes the
features an item spells out, both conditionings are lost, and Agr would have to refer to the
exponents *-rā* and *-bā*, and to each allomorph of Asp[perf], one by one; that is the book's
argument for non-deletion (§4.6.3). The Hungarian plural of (7) and (8) looks outward at the
possessive, and the Korean nominative of (10) and (11) looks inward at whether its host ends in a
consonant or a vowel. The predictions of (C3) in (43) are that outward conditioning sees synsem
features only, the possessive being bare when the plural is realized, while inward conditioning
may see the phonological features of a realized exponent.

## Implementation notes

* The book's rule (38) deletes T[−past] outright; here T[−past] receives a null exponent and is
  pruned from the concatenation statements, the alternative the book itself offers for
  transparent zero morphemes in §7.3.2, so that the four tenses share the one spine
  ROOT-v-(Asp)-T-Agr of (35).
* The theme vowel is the exponent of v, as in (36a), spelled out in the context of the root's
  conjugation feature [+I].
* (42) prints the number feature of the *-m* item as [−sg] where (39) has [−pl], and omits the
  third singular *-t* of (33a); both are restored.
* The Korean hosts are transcribed into the segments of `Fragments.Korean.Phonology`, so that the
  consonant-final or vowel-final shape an item refers to is read off the [consonantal] value of
  the final segment rather than listed per host.
* The examples are `Data.Examples.Embick2015`.
