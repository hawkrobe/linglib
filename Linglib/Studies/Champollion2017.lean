# Champollion 2017: distributivity as a bridge between aspect and measurement

Champollion's *Parts of a Whole* unifies predicative distributivity, atelicity and
pseudopartitive measurement under one property, stratified reference: a predicate applies to an
event that divides exhaustively into parts the predicate also applies to, along some dimension.
The dimension varies, thematic roles for distributivity, run time for the *for*-adverbial and a
measure for the pseudopartitive, while the property is defined once. Lexical cumulativity, which
the book assumes throughout, entails Krifka's cumulativity, and atelicity along the run time is
a Schwarzschild cover into parts with properly smaller run times. Against Krifka's subregion
account of *for*-adverbials, the book's back-and-forth scenario has stratified reference and
violates the subregion presupposition. The per-verb distributivity facts are meaning postulates,
stated over the Fragment verbs' denotations.

## Main definitions

* `StratifiedReference`: an event divides into parts the predicate applies to, whose images along
  a dimension stand in a granularity relation to the event's.
* `DistributiveReference`: stratified reference along a thematic role with atomic granularity.
* `SubintervalReference`: stratified reference along the run time with proper subintervals.
* `MeasurementReference`: stratified reference along a measure with smaller values.
* `Verb.StratifiesOver`: a verb's denotation has distributive reference along a role.
* `LexicallyCumulative`: a predicate is a fixed point of algebraic closure.
* `ChampollionPostulates`: the per-verb distributivity postulates.

## Main results

* `lexicallyCumulative_imp_cum`: lexical cumulativity entails Krifka's `CUM`.
* `subintervalReference_iff_cover`: atelicity is a finite cover into proper-subinterval parts.
* `stratifiedReference_of_divisiveness`: on a temporally separable event, Krifka's divisiveness
  clause gives stratified reference along the run time.
* `pushCarts_stratified`: the back-and-forth event of Figure 6.2 has stratified reference.
* `pushCarts_not_subregion`: that event fails the subregion presupposition.

## Implementation notes

* Vendler classes are not among the book's primitives; its atelicity diagnostic is the
  subinterval-reference test.
* The granularity is a binary relation between the image of a part and the image of the whole,
  where the book has a unary predicate built from the whole, so that the three specializations
  are instances of one definition.
* Stratified reference along the runtime neither entails nor follows from Krifka's `CUM`: the
  book takes every verb to be cumulative, telic ones included, and a predicate of events of
  bounded length has stratified reference over dense time without being closed under sums.
* The runtime dimension of chapter 6 is any monotone map into a part order of times, so the
  stratified reference in play is the generic `StratifiedReference τ (· < ·)` rather than the
  interval-runtime `SubintervalReference`; runtimes of back-and-forth events are discontinuous
  (the chapter's footnote on the scenario), and the finite model takes them to be sets of
  instants.
* The presupposition (28) is stated as the chapter states it, with the universal clause over the
  temporal parts of the event; the reflexive case is the predicate at the event itself.

/-! ### Relational distributive reference (neo-Davidsonian roles)

Champollion's `DistributiveReference` takes a *functional* thematic role
`θ : α → Entity` (the unique role-filler). linglib's neo-Davidsonian roles
are *relational* — `ArgumentStructure.ThematicRel = Entity → Event → Prop`,
`Agent(a, e)` — with thematic uniqueness available as
`Mereology.UP`. `RelationalDistributiveReference` is the relational
form, so the distributivity property composes directly with a
`ThematicFrame` / `Verb.denote` without picking a role function. It
coincides with the functional form on a role's graph
(`relationalDistributiveReference_graph`). -/

/-! ### Stratified Measurement StratifiedReference -/

/-! **`MeasurementReference`** is [champollion-2017]'s *stratified
    measurement reference* (his named property and abbreviation): Def 61
    in the Ch 4 §4.6 unification, with final universal/restricted forms
    Defs 52–53 in Ch 7 §7.4, written as `SR_{μ, λd.d < μ(x)}` (*thirty
    liters of water*, *five feet of snow*, *two degrees Celsius of global
    warming*).

    The strict-less-than granularity is Champollion's faithful translation
    of [schwarzschild-2006]'s monotonic measure-function predicate
    (Ch 7 eq. 8: `μ` is monotonic iff `a < b → μ(a) < μ(b)`), with the
    extensive/intensive measure-function distinction ([krifka-1998])
    reduced to whether the resulting measurement-reference presupposition
    is satisfiable on the given substance noun.
-/

/-- Stratified measurement reference is stratified reference whose dimension is a measure
    function μ and whose granularity is strict less-than on the scale, so
    `MeasurementReference μ P x` holds iff `x` can be decomposed into `P`-parts with strictly
    smaller μ-values. -/
def MeasurementReference {α β : Type*} [SemilatticeSup α] [Preorder β]
    (μ : α → β) (P : α → Prop) (x : α) : Prop :=

/-! ### Distributivity Constraint -/

/-- The Distributivity Constraint of [champollion-2017] accepts a distributive construction with
share `Share`, map `Map` and granularity `gran` describing `x` exactly when the share has
stratified reference along the map at that granularity. Adverbial *each*, *for*-adverbials and
pseudopartitives differ only in the three parameters. -/
