# Champollion 2017: distributivity as a bridge between aspect and measurement

This file formalizes results from *Parts of a Whole* ([champollion-2017]), which unifies
predicative distributivity, atelicity and pseudopartitive measurement under one property,
stratified reference: a predicate applies to an event exactly when that event divides
exhaustively into parts the predicate also applies to, along some dimension. The dimension is what
varies — thematic roles for distributivity, runtime for the *for*-adverbial, measure for the
pseudopartitive — and the property is defined once (`StratifiedReference`), with the three
specializations as instances (`DistributiveReference`, `SubintervalReference`,
`MeasurementReference`).

Two things are done here with that property. Lexical cumulativity, which the book assumes
throughout, entails Krifka's `CUM`; and atelicity in the runtime dimension is the existence of a
Schwarzschild cover into proper-subinterval parts, which is the book's own theorem relating
algebraic closure to covers. The per-verb distributivity facts — *see* distributing on both roles,
*kill* on its theme only, *meet* on neither — are meaning postulates in the book's sense, and are
recorded as such, over the Fragment verbs' denotations.

Vendler classes are not among the book's primitives; its atelicity diagnostic is the
subinterval-reference test, not a class label.

Chapter 6 sets the book's strata-based account of *for*-adverbials against [krifka-1998]'s
subregion-based one, whose presupposition (28) requires every temporal part of the event to fall
under the predicate. On an event that splits into two temporally non-overlapping parts the
subregion presupposition yields stratified reference along the runtime
(`stratifiedReference_of_divisiveness`); the *push carts all the way to the store for fifty
minutes* scenario of Figure 6.2, on a model of eight legs of four trips, has stratified reference
but violates the presupposition at the halfway legs (`pushCarts_stratified`,
`pushCarts_not_subregion`), which is the chapter's case against divisive reference.

## Main definitions

* `StratifiedReference` — a predicate's event divides into parts the predicate applies to, whose
  images along a dimension stand in a granularity relation to the event's
* `DistributiveReference`, `SubintervalReference`, `MeasurementReference` — the dimension is a
  thematic role with atomic granularity, the runtime with proper subintervals, a measure with
  smaller values
* `Verb.StratifiesOver` — a verb's denotation has stratified distributive reference along a role
* `LexicallyCumulative` — a predicate is a fixed point of algebraic closure
* `ChampollionPostulates` — the per-verb distributivity postulates over Fragment verbs

## Main results

* `lexicallyCumulative_imp_cum` — lexical cumulativity entails Krifka's `CUM`
* `subintervalReference_iff_cover` — atelicity is a finite cover into proper-subinterval parts
* `stratifiedReference_of_divisiveness` — on a temporally separable event, Krifka's divisiveness
  clause gives stratified reference along the runtime
* `pushCarts_stratified`, `pushCarts_not_subregion` — the Figure 6.2 event has stratified
  reference and fails the subregion presupposition

## Implementation notes

* The granularity is a binary relation between the image of a part and the image of the whole,
  where the book has a unary predicate built from the whole, so that the three specializations
  are instances of one definition.
* Stratified reference along the runtime neither entails nor follows from Krifka's `CUM`: the
  book takes every verb to be cumulative, telic ones included, and a predicate of events of
  bounded length has stratified reference over dense time without being closed under sums.
* The runtime dimension of chapter 6 is any monotone map into a part order of times, so the
  stratified reference in play is the generic `StratifiedReference τ (· < ·)` rather than the
  interval-runtime `SubintervalReference`; runtimes of back-and-forth events are discontinuous
  (the chapter's footnote on the scenario), and the finite model takes them to be sets of
  instants.
* The presupposition (28) is stated as the chapter states it, with the universal clause over the
  temporal parts of the event; the reflexive case is the predicate at the event itself.

/-! ### Stratified reference ([champollion-2017] eq. 16/17) -/

/-- Stratified reference is the core unified property of
    [champollion-2017] eq. (16), with the binary-granularity
    convention from eq. (17)'s γ-helper inlined.

    `StratifiedReference d γ P x` holds iff `x` can be decomposed into `P`-parts `y`
    whose `d`-images stand in relation `γ` to `d x`.

    - `d : α → β` — the *dimension* (thematic role θ, runtime τ, measure μ, ...)
    - `γ : β → β → Prop` — the *granularity* relating inner (`d y`) to outer
      (`d x`). Uncurried form of Champollion's eq. (17) γ-helper
      `γ(M, x) := λd. d < M(x)`.
    - `P : α → Prop` — the predicate under scrutiny ("the Share")
    - `x : α` — the entity being decomposed

    `StratifiedReference d γ P x = *{y : P(y) ∧ γ (d y) (d x)}(x)`. -/
def StratifiedReference {α β : Type*} [SemilatticeSup α]
    (d : α → β) (γ : β → β → Prop) (P : α → Prop) (x : α) : Prop :=
  AlgClosure (fun y ↦ P y ∧ γ (d y) (d x)) x

/-! ### Universal stratified reference -/

/-- `P` has universal stratified reference along `d` at granularity `γ` when every `P`-entity
    has stratified reference. -/
def StratifiedReferenceUniv {α β : Type*} [SemilatticeSup α]
    (d : α → β) (γ : β → β → Prop) (P : α → Prop) : Prop :=

/-! ### Atomic granularity (shared γ) -/

/-- Atomic granularity for dimensions where `[PartialOrder β]` is
    available: the inner d-image is an `Atom` in β. Used by
    `DistributiveReference` (dimension = θ thematic role; entities have a
    partial-order instance via the entity lattice).

    For dimensions without a `PartialOrder` instance — notably the
    runtime dimension (`NonemptyInterval T`) used by stativity — atomicity
    is expressed dimension-natively (e.g., `NonemptyInterval.IsPoint` for
    `NonemptyInterval T`). The unification is at the `StratifiedReference`
    parameter-space level: both express "γ = inner is atomic in the
    dimension's natural sense" at different concrete instantiations. -/

/-! ### Stratified Distributive StratifiedReference ([champollion-2017] eq. 24) -/

/-- Stratified distributive reference is stratified reference whose dimension is a thematic
    role θ and whose granularity is `Atom` on the inner image, the outer being unused since
    atomicity is an absolute property ([champollion-2017] eq. (24)). It captures
    distributivity, as "The boys each saw a movie" distributes over atomic agents. -/

/-! ### Relational distributive reference (neo-Davidsonian roles)

Champollion's `DistributiveReference` takes a *functional* thematic role
`θ : α → Entity` (the unique role-filler). linglib's neo-Davidsonian roles
are *relational* — `ArgumentStructure.ThematicRel = Entity → Event → Prop`,
`Agent(a, e)` — with thematic uniqueness available as
`Mereology.UP`. `RelationalDistributiveReference` is the relational
form, so the distributivity property composes directly with a
`ThematicFrame` / `Verb.denote` without picking a role function. It
coincides with the functional form on a role's graph
(`relationalDistributiveReference_graph`). -/

/-- Relational stratified distributive reference takes the role to be a
    neo-Davidsonian relation `R : Entity → α → Prop`. A stratum `y` counts
    iff it has an atomic `R`-filler. Under thematic uniqueness
    (`Mereology.UP R`) that filler is unique, recovering "the
    `R`-filler of `y` is atomic". -/

/-! ### Stratified Measurement StratifiedReference -/

/-! **`MeasurementReference`** is [champollion-2017]'s *stratified
    measurement reference* (his named property and abbreviation): Def 61
    in the Ch 4 §4.6 unification, with final universal/restricted forms
    Defs 52–53 in Ch 7 §7.4, written as `SR_{μ, λd.d < μ(x)}` (*thirty
    liters of water*, *five feet of snow*, *two degrees Celsius of global
    warming*).

    The strict-less-than granularity is Champollion's faithful translation
    of [schwarzschild-2006]'s monotonic measure-function predicate
    (Ch 7 eq. 8: `μ` is monotonic iff `a < b → μ(a) < μ(b)`), with the
    extensive/intensive measure-function distinction ([krifka-1998])
    reduced to whether the resulting measurement-reference presupposition
    is satisfiable on the given substance noun.
-/

/-- Stratified measurement reference is stratified reference whose dimension is a measure
    function μ and whose granularity is strict less-than on the scale, so
    `MeasurementReference μ P x` holds iff `x` can be decomposed into `P`-parts with strictly
    smaller μ-values. -/

/-! ### Distributivity Constraint -/

/-- [champollion-2017] Ch 4 §4.6 **Distributivity Constraint**
    (restated in Ch 7 §7.4 for the measurement chapter):
    a distributive construction with Share `S`, Map `M`, granularity `γ`
    describing entity `x` is acceptable iff `SR_{M,γ}(S)(x)`. The same
    constraint underlies adverbial-*each*, *for*-adverbials, and
    pseudopartitives — they differ only in how `M`, `γ`, and `S` are set. -/
abbrev DistributivityConstraint {α β : Type*} [SemilatticeSup α]
    (Map : α → β) (gran : β → β → Prop) (Share : α → Prop) (x : α) : Prop :=
  StratifiedReference Map gran Share x

/-! ### Construction Instances -/

/-- "each" distributes over atomic θ-fillers.
    Map = θ (thematic role), granularity = Atom (inner only). -/
abbrev eachConstr {α β : Type*} [SemilatticeSup α] [PartialOrder β]
    (θ : α → β) (Share : α → Prop) (x : α) : Prop :=

/-- **Dimension-polymorphic substrate witness.** Stratified reference with
    reflexive granularity is satisfied by every `P`-element via the base
    case. Quantifies over any `d : α → β` (no sum homomorphism needed for
    this direction, since the witness is structural).

    The companion direction — closure under sums via a `SupHom` — is
    `stratifiedReference_join` below; together they establish that stratified
    reference composes faithfully with the trace-function abstraction. -/

/-- Stratified reference is closed under join when (i) the dimension is a

    trace-function abstraction (`d : SupHom α β`, applicable uniformly to
    τ, σ, agentOf, patientOf, themeOf) composes correctly with stratified
    reference.

    The `SupHom` structure ensures `d (x ⊔ y) = d x ⊔ d y`; the
    monotonicity assumption on γ then carries the stratification witnesses
    for `x` and `y` over to a witness for `x ⊔ y`. -/
