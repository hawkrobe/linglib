# George (2011): Question Embedding and the Semantics of Answers

George builds a question from an abstract, the extension at each world of a property of the
things a *wh*-phrase ranges over. The question operator gives its mention-some answers and,
composed with an exhaustivity operator, its strongly exhaustive answers, the fibers of the abstract;
a responsive predicate holds of a question when it holds of some answer. Against weak
exhaustivity, the strongly exhaustive answers of a question and its negation coincide because
complementation is a bijection of extensions, and knowing one settles the other only for an agent
who knows the domain, so *Maggie knows who was admitted but not who wasn't* is consistent on strong
readings. Against reducibility, question-embedding *know* depends on belief as well as knowledge,
and George's twin relations theory derives both uses of a responsive predicate from a pair of an
existential and a universal relation to propositions.

## Main statements

* `exhaustifiedPartition_mentionSome_eq_diff`: the answers that are some world's strong answer are
  the strongly exhaustive answers other than the contradiction.
* `negation_generalization`, `restricted_compl_subsingleton_iff`: a question and its negation have
  the same strongly exhaustive answers, and with a restrictor outside the negation knowing one
  settles the other exactly when the domain is known.
* `reducible_iff_exists`, `reducible_embed`: a reducible predicate is one computed from the answers
  and the propositions it holds of, as every reductive account is.
* `TwinRelations.exists_proposition_of_question`, `TwinRelations.question_of_forall_proposition`,
  `TwinRelations.question_singleton`: the linking results of the twin relations theory.
* `Newspaper.know_not_reducible`, `know_question_stronglyExhaustive_iff`: *know* is not reducible,
  but on strongly exhaustive answers it is knowing the true answer.
* `rows_predicted`: the dissertation's truth judgments in its scenarios.

## Implementation notes

Abstracts are functions `W → Set τ` from worlds to extensions, and answer sets are
`Set (Set W)`. George takes knowledge and belief as primitives; the scenarios model belief by
doxastic states and knowledge as true belief, and only factivity is used in general. His
*ignorare* (101b) drops the existential conjunct that the twin relations rule yields, so the two
agree on nonempty answer sets. In the admission scenarios the fourth candidate is Wesley of (16),
and Rupert's state is Maggie's: the scenarios differ in their questions.
