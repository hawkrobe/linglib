# Anscombe 1964: before and after

*Before* and *after* are not converses: *the Parthenon was there after St. Peter's was* and
*St. Peter's was there after the Parthenon was* are compatible, while the corresponding
*before* claims are not (§I). *p before q* is *p and not q, and then q*; it is asymmetric and
transitive once *repetition* — *p, then not p, then p* — is excluded, whereas *p after q*,
*q and then p*, is neither, and *p before q* entails *q after p* but not conversely (§II).
Quantifying over times renders *p before q* as *a time of p before every time of q* (§IV),
which is right for *before ever* rather than *before* (§V): the two agree exactly when *q*
does not repeat. For instantaneous events *before* and *after* are genuine converses
(§VIII); otherwise a beginning or an ending is always involved (§IX–§X).

A clause's present-tense proposition holds at the times of its `timeTrace`, so excluding
repetition is `Set.OrdConnected` and an instantaneous event has a singleton trace.
