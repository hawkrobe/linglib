# Longobardi (2001): How Comparative Is Semantics?

This file formalizes the parametric theory of bare nouns and proper names of
[longobardi-2001]. A nominal argument is either referential, a constant denoting through the
lexical reference of its head, or quantificational, a variable bound by an existential or a
generic operator (`ArgumentType`). A quantificational bare noun has the existential reading
where the predicate is stage-level and the generic reading where the environment is
characterizing, habitual aspect, an adverb of generality, or an eventive individual-level
predicate, the tables (11) and (32), and nothing with a stative individual-level or a
kind-level predicate (`Environment`, `quantReadings`); a referential bare noun is a kind name
and generic everywhere (44). Romance bare nouns are only quantificational, English bare nouns
may also be referential (44), which reduces to whether D carries strong referential features
(`DPParameter`, `bnReadings`): Romance bare nouns read exactly as overt indefinites
(`romance_eq_indefinite`, (5a)), are generic only in characterizing environments
(`romance_gen_iff`, (5c)), and are existential exactly with stage-level predicates
(`ex_iff_stageLevel`, (14a)), while English bare nouns are generic everywhere and the two
languages differ exactly in the non-characterizing environments (`english_gen`,
`contrast_iff`, (48)). Kind anaphora requires a kind-referring antecedent, so only English
bare nouns and Romance definites license the species reading (`species_iff`, (22), (24),
(37)). The syntax of proper names and the semantics of bare nouns are one parameter:
object-referring nouns occur without a filled D exactly when kind-referring nouns can
(`typological_generalization`, (56)), and a strong D whose adjectives are opaque to
N-raising forces an article on every proper name, the Greek prediction (61), (65)
(`pnRequiresArticle_greek`). The rows of `Data/Examples/Longobardi2001` are the paper's
paradigms, and the readings they record are the ones the parameter predicts
(`readings_predicted`, `definite_generic`, `species_rows`, `greek_names`); the parameter also
fixes the nominal mapping of [chierchia-1998] that the fragments declare
(`toNominalMapping`, `fragment_mappings`).

## Implementation notes

The two parameters are Boolean coordinates of the paper's table (61), the Celtic setting of
fn. 35 being the fourth cell. The Greek definite of (64b), ungrammatical on its generic
reading in an episodic sentence, is recorded but not predicted, the paper's claim (40a) about
definite generics in episodic sentences being made for Romance. Reading availability counts
the paper's marginal readings as available.
