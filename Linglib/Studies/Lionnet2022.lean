# Lionnet (2022): The Features and Geometry of Tone in Laal

This file formalizes the subtonal analysis of the three-height tone system of Laal in
[lionnet-2022]. The heights are bundles of two register features on a tonal root node, in
the two-feature model of [yip-1980] and [pulleyblank-1986] and the geometry of [snider-2020]:
H is `[+upper, −raised]`, M is `[−upper, +raised]`, L is `[−upper, −raised]`, and
`[+upper, +raised]` is the system's gap (`featural_analysis`, `superHigh_is_the_gap`). The
analysis unifies the behaviour of the mid tone. It never shares a stem with another height
(`M_exclusive`); it lowers to L under a `[−raised]` neighbour, the only `[+raised]` tone being
the only target (`mLowering_from_L`, `H_stable`); and the ventive suffix, a floating
`[−raised]` taking `[upper]` from the root, surfaces as H after H and as L after M and L
(`ventive_after_M`). The tonal root node lets a feature act on its own tier apart from the
whole tone: on the multi-tier autosegmental foundation, delinking the `[raised]` feature
leaves the association of the tone to its mora untouched (`partial_indep_of_full`).

## Implementation notes

The substrate `TRN` bundle carries the two register features, and `TRN.assimilate` and
`TRN.dock` are the `[−raised]` spreading and docking of the paper's derivations. The fusion
of adjacent identical `[−raised]` autosegments, which the paper mentions as an option it does
not adopt, is the `OCP.collapse` face of the tier-relative OCP. The full-tone spreading and
deletion processes of the paper's §6, its vowel harmony, and the alternative analyses of its
§7 are not represented.

    TRN.H = ⟨some true, some false⟩ ∧
    TRN.M = ⟨some false, some true⟩ ∧
    TRN.L = ⟨some false, some false⟩ := ⟨rfl, rfl, rfl⟩

/-! ### M-exclusivity: `*MX/XM` (§3, §5.4) -/

the melody is *all* M — M never co-occurs with a different tone at stem level. -/
theorem M_exclusive :
    ∀ m ∈ attestedMelodies, Tone.M ∈ m → ∀ t ∈ m, t = Tone.M := by decide

/-! ### M-lowering as `[−raised]` assimilation (§5.2) -/

/-- M-lowering is `[−raised]` assimilation: an L trigger (`[−raised]`) spreads its
`[raised]` value onto M (the only `[+raised]` tone), turning it into L. -/
theorem mLowering_from_L : TRN.assimilate .raised TRN.L TRN.M = TRN.L := by decide

/-- M-lowering from a `[−raised]` H trigger likewise turns M into L. -/
theorem mLowering_from_H : TRN.assimilate .raised TRN.H TRN.M = TRN.L := by decide

/-- Only M is targeted: H is inert under `[−raised]` assimilation (already
`[−raised]`), explaining why H- and L-toned roots never lower. -/
theorem H_stable : TRN.assimilate .raised TRN.L TRN.H = TRN.H := by decide

/-! ### The ventive suffix (§5.5) -/

/-- The ventive suffix (ex. 60) is a floating `[−raised]` feature with `[upper]`
inherited from the root: `TRN.dock .raised false`. It surfaces as H after a
`[+upper]` (H) root and as L after `[−upper]` (M or L) roots — the M-lowering
realisation `kárá`/`dàgà`/`jàrà`. -/

def laalToneInventory : List TRN := ([Tone.H, Tone.M, Tone.L]).map toneToTRN

/-- The fourth feature combination `[+upper, +raised]` (`TRN.superHigh`) is absent:
it is the systematic gap that makes Laal a Table-4 type-A system (§5.6). -/

/-! ### The optional OCP-`[raised]` merger (§5.2, ex. 53–55, 58) -/

/-- The paper (exx. 54–55, 58) mentions, without adopting, an optional OCP-`[raised]`
economy under which two adjacent identical `[−raised]` autosegments fuse into one
multiply-linked autosegment; for fully identical adjacent tones that fusion is
`OCP.collapse`. -/

    OCP.collapse [TRN.L, TRN.L] = [TRN.L] := by decide

/-- OCP-`[raised]` is **tier-relative** ([chandlee-jardine-2019]): it constrains the
`[raised]`-projected tier (`IsCleanOn` reading `.raised`), not whole TRNs. H and L
are distinct *tones* but both `[−raised]`, so adjacent they violate OCP-`[raised]`
even though `[TRN.H, TRN.L]` is clean as a whole-TRN tier. -/
theorem ocp_raised_is_tier_relative :
    ¬ OCP.IsCleanOn (λ _ : TRN => True) (·.raised) [TRN.H, TRN.L] ∧
      OCP.IsClean [TRN.H, TRN.L] := by decide

/-- Under the optional economy, fusing adjacent identical `[raised]` autosegments leaves
the `[raised]`-projected tier OCP-clean. -/

    OCP.IsClean (OCP.collapse (tier.map (·.raised))) :=
  OCP.collapse_clean _

/-! ### The register-tier geometry on the multi-tier substrate (§5–§6)

The geometry of (52) is a hub and spokes around the tonal root node: the `[±upper]` tier,
the `[±raised]` tier, and the mora tier each associate to it. On the graph foundation this
is a four-tier graph, on which a subtonal feature is a tier of its own and so can be
manipulated apart from the whole node, the paper's partial activity, which the bundled
`TRN` record cannot express; whole-node operations act on the node-to-mora layer. -/
