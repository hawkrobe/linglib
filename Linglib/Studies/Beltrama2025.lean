# Beltrama (2025): Evaluation, thresholds, and practical commitments

Mildly positive adjectives, *decent*, *acceptable*, *adequate*, are context-sensitive and
gradable like *good* yet crisp, *barely*-friendly and without a zone of indifference like
the absolute adjectives, and they resist *slightly*, the diagnostic of a minimum standard
([beltrama-2025], against [kennedy-mcnally-2005]'s absolute class). Their positive form
takes a necessity standard: the greatest degree of value the object has in every
circumstantially accessible world in which it is pursued, the standard that *enough*
supplies with an overt purpose ([nadathur-2023]) and a functional standard in
[kagan-alexeyenko-2011]'s sense, so that [kennedy-2007]'s standard-fixing function must
range over functional standards beside the endpoints and comparison-class norms of
Interpretive Economy. The middling inference of *decent* is a scalar implicature against
*good*, and the missing zone of indifference follows from the standard's existential
force: an object is acceptable only if some accessible circumstance pursues it, and
unacceptable only if none does.

## Implementation notes

The necessity standard is the greatest lower bound of the object's values over the pursued
accessible worlds, mathlib's `IsGLB`, which is the paper's maximum of the lower bounds; the
value scale is any partial order, open above where a theorem needs it. Existential force is
derived under the assumption that circumstantial alternatives leave the object's value
fixed. The behaviour with *barely*, emphasis in downward-entailing contexts and *-able*
derivation are recorded in the example rows only.

def pursuedValues : Set D := μ x '' {w' | w' ∈ Acc w ∧ pursued x w'}

/-- (64): the necessity standard is the greatest degree the object's value reaches in every
accessible world where it is pursued, the greatest lower bound of `pursuedValues`. -/

/-- *acceptable*: the object meets a necessity standard. -/
def Acceptable : Prop := ∃ s, IsNecessityStandard Acc pursued μ x w s ∧ Pos μ x w s

/-- *unacceptable*, the negated form's universal force: no accessible world pursues the
object. -/

/-- The positive form of a minimum-standard adjective: any degree above the scale minimum. -/
def PosMin [OrderBot D] : Prop := ⊥ < μ x w

/-- With *good*'s standard above the necessity standard, *good* entails *decent*, so
*decent* implicates *not good*. -/
theorem pos_of_pos_of_le {t : D} (h : s ≤ t) (ht : Pos μ x w t) : Pos μ x w s := h.trans ht

/-- The implicature is cancelable: meeting the higher standard is consistent with meeting the
lower one, so *decent, in fact good* is consistent. -/
