# Middleton (2026): A Remark on the Ordering of Impoverishment Rules: Differences between Taos and Basque

Arregi and Nevins divide the postsyntax into modules, impoverishment before metathesis and, within
impoverishment, the paradigmatic rules, conditioned by the node they change, before the
syntagmatic ones. Middleton tests both orders on the verbal agreement prefixes of Taos
(Kiowa-Tanoan). Impoverishment feeds metathesis in Taos as in Basque; but in four Taos
interactions a paradigmatic rule would bleed a syntagmatic one the attested forms need, while in a
fifth they need the bleeding, so the two kinds of impoverishment interleave. The file transcribes
the online appendix's analysis, its rules of impoverishment, metathesis, exponence, epenthesis
and tone, and derives from it the paradigm of `Fragments/Taos/Agreement.lean`.

## Main results

* `derive_eq_form`: the appendix's rules derive every cell of the paradigm but the nine it leaves
  open (`unaccounted`).
* `must_interleave`: the orders cases 1 and 5 need respect neither block architecture, each
  case resting on one bleeding fact (`r40_bleeds_r34a` to `r26_bleeds_r29`).
* `mopen_tiers`: the rules of exponence read their leftmost brackets on the tiers of
  `[±participant]` and of number; read on the present arguments alone, they lose the exponents
  of *mopén*.
* `r24_feeds_m23`, `Basque.ondarru_feeds`, `Basque.zamudio_bleeds`: impoverishment feeds
  metathesis in Taos, and Participant Dissimilation feeds or bleeds Ergative Metathesis in Basque.

## Implementation notes

* Inverse number is the one feature `Feat.inverse`, which `Arg.Has` reads as containing the
  dual's values (`Taos.dual_le_inverse`); the category labels *s*, *d*, *p*, *i* are exact tests
  on the number features (`Arg.IsSingular` and kin).
* The paper labels its (35) and (43), the appendix's (40) and (26), paradigmatic, though as
  printed each carries a condition on another slot: `r40` and `r26` follow the labels, `r40'`
  and `r26'` the printed rules, and both sets derive the paradigm (`derive_eq_form_printed`).
* Three orderings are this study's repairs of the appendix's sets, forced by cells its listing
  would not derive: (32) after (7), (44) after (43), and (44)'s context widened (see `r32`,
  `r44`).
* Exponence is the appendix's rules as `ExponenceRule`s, each bracket read in the adjacent window
  of a tier (`onTiers`), the present arguments keeping an agent impoverishment has left only
  `[+author]`, as the appendix's trace reading has it; a third person object's number is null
  (`objectNumberNull`). The portmanteaux, epenthesis and tone carry the additions the appendix's
  prose uses but never states (see `exponence`).

## TODO

* The nine cells in `unaccounted`, with what the pipeline gives them in
  `derive_unaccounted`: ∅:2s:∅ and 1:2s:∅ (*o*; the appendix says it will return to them and
  does not, and the rules give *kǫ*), 3i:3p (printed toneless; footnote 5 calls that a typo
  for high, but (50c) gives a closed final syllable falling, *îw*), 3i:refl (printed *ímó*;
  the rules give footnote 6's corrected *ímo*), and the three 3d possessives with an object
  (Table 3 prints *ónôm* and *ónôw*, but the tone rule (51h) and the appendix's Tables 8, 14,
  17 and 38 have *ónóm* and *ónów*, which the rules give).
* The paper's (13) is an adjacent swap; the study follows Arregi and Nevins's fronting rule,
  which the Zamudio auxiliary of (19) needs, and its rejected-order outputs are Arregi and
  Nevins's stranded forms rather than the paper's starred (17b) and (19b).

`ImpoverishmentRule` at that slot's neighborhood whose target is the structural change. Rules the
appendix writes with an agent bracket followed by an object bracket apply only without a goal;
the appendix's prose orders (33) before (32), (5) before (7), and (45) before (40). -/

The 3S:3S prefix is ∅ (Table 15), so no *m*, the exponent of a third person object (31), is
inserted: the object's third person must be gone at Vocabulary Insertion, which (34a) does only
while the agent is still there for its context. The theorems are about the feature bundles the
two orders leave; that the block order conflicts with Arregi and Nevins rests on the paper's
labelling of (40) as paradigmatic (see the implementation notes). -/

obliterated and its singular features deleted by (45), which need the singular agent that (40)
removes. The 3S:3S half reaches the surface (the block order leaves a singular object, which
would be exponed); the dummy half is featural only, since a one-argument prefix with a
featureless dummy object is ∅ and toneless under either order. -/

A rule of exponence realizes one of its target features, the first its bundle bears, and discharges
the others, as `S ⇔ ǫ` leaves a singular's `[+minimal]` unexponed. Its brackets are conditions on
the arguments around the target's slot, each read in the adjacent window of one tier: the leftmost
brackets `[[π` and `[[ω` on the tiers of `[±participant]` and of number, the others on the tier of
the present arguments. A rule with brackets on several tiers refers to several nodes, as the
hyper-contextual rules of [moskal-smith-2016] do. -/

/-! ### Impoverishment precedes metathesis in Basque (§3.1)

The finite auxiliary of (10) is a string of terminals: the absolutive clitic, T, and the
ergative and dative clitics. Participant Dissimilation, the paper's (16) and (18) after Arregi
and Nevins's (25), obliterates a clitic in the Feature Markedness module; T-Noninitiality, the
paper's (12), is repaired in the Linear Operations module by Ergative Metathesis (13) or
L-Support, one module as in Arregi and Nevins's §6.2.4. T bears `[+tense]` for their `[+past]`,
and the dative-clitic conditions of their Ergative Metathesis and the `[+motion]` restriction of
Participant Dissimilation, which the two auxiliaries do not reach, are left out. -/
