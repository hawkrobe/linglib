# Krifka (2003): Bare NPs: Kind-referring, Indefinites, Both, or Neither?

Krifka treats bare noun phrases as properties that type shifts, applied locally, turn into
indefinites or kinds: in the terms of the title, they are neither, but can become both. A count
noun relates numbers to individuals, so a singular count noun cannot be an argument, and the
semantic plural fills the number argument without requiring more than one, since *Yes, one*
answers *Do you have dogs?*. The existential shift applies where a predicate meets a verbal
predicate, so a bare plural takes narrow scope under negation even when moved over it, while a
determiner phrase scopes wide. Kind reference is Chierchia's down operator, which Krifka does not
confine to cumulative properties.

## Main results

* `Krifka2003.isExtensiveMeasure_ofAtoms`: atom-counting nouns are extensive measures (53).
* `Krifka2003.qua_withNumber_ofAtoms`, `Krifka2003.cum_pluralize_ofAtoms`: numeral phrases are
  quantized and the semantic plural is cumulative.
* `Krifka2003.iota_withNumber_one`: in a world with exactly one dog, ∩ of *one dog* is that dog.
* `Krifka2003.bare_narrow`, `Krifka2003.indefinite_wide_numeral_narrow`: bare plurals scope
  below negation, and *two dogs* scopes over it only as a determiner phrase.

## Implementation notes

* Composition is stated on extensions at a world. The composition rule (51) is `Den.app`:
  functional application whichever way is well formed, and otherwise the existential shift of
  a predicate meeting a verbal predicate. Movement over negation binds a type-neutral
  variable, which substitutes the moved denotation at its trace, or an entity variable, which
  abstracts over the trace; a property has no rule for meeting the abstract, which is the
  paper's requirement that the trace of a bare noun phrase be untyped.
* Count nouns that count atoms (`ofAtoms`) witness the measure laws and yield the
  quantization of numeral phrases and the cumulativity of the semantic plural.
* The down operator at a world is `Reference.iota` of `IsGreatest`, the largest member of the
  extension.
* The topic condition on kind reference, the choice-function reading of *some*, and the
  singular definite generics of the paper's last section are not formalized.
