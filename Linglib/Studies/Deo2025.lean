# Deo (2025): Take on this commitment: the particle *bərə* in Marathi

This file formalizes [deo-2025-bara]'s analysis of the Marathi utterance-final particle *bərə*
in declaratives and imperatives. The particle turns a declarative into a warning, a piece of
advice or a reminder and an imperative into a command, a warning or a strong recommendation,
(1) to (8) and (12) to (15), and is out in a commissive and in the response to one, (9) and
(16), and in the imperatives of requests, pleas, offers, permissions, concessions and curses,
(10) and (11). The analysis is set in a commitment-based theory of sentential force
([gunlogson-2001], [farkas-bruce-2010], [condoravdi-lauer-2012]): the discourse commitments of
a participant are doxastic or preferential, (17a), the common ground and the joint preferences
are their intersections across participants, (17b) and (17c), and a declarative or an
imperative commits the speaker to its content under the one attitude or the other, (18).
[gunlogson-2008]'s distinction between the participant who is the source of a commitment and
one who is a dependent, taking it on from the other party's testimony or expressed preference,
is extended to preferential commitments, §3.2. *Bərə* adds a commitment of its own, (20): the
speaker's preferential commitment to the addressee's dependent uptake of the content. Its
felicity condition, (21), is that the speaker takes the uptake to be a precondition for an
addressee-benefiting goal among the speaker's effective preferences and, §3.3, that nothing
shows the addressee's action choices already aligned with the goal. The profile follows, §3.4:
when the addressee is manifestly a source for the content, the uptake is unrealizable and the
*bərə* commitment cannot be sincere, which excludes permissions, concessions, commissives and
their responses, and the revealed preference of (15); an offer or invitation leaves the choice
to the addressee, against the preference for dependent uptake; a request, a plea or a curse
serves no addressee-benefiting goal; and the warning of (5a) meets the felicity condition where
(5b), whose content is one way among many to the goal, does not.

## Implementation notes

The commitment state is indexed by worlds, as in `CondoravdiLauer2012.imp`, so that the uptake
of a content is a proposition, the worlds at which the addressee is a dependent for it. Being a
source for a content, the paper's `DC_x^ind`, is having a commitment of one's own to it under
either attitude, and being a dependent is having a commitment to it on the other party's word
and none of one's own; `Commitment.Source` supplies the coordinate. The paper's effective
preferences `EP(s, w)` are `Desire.Preferential.Want` and the sincerity of the *bərə*
commitment is `Commitment.Sincere`, so that its infelicity under a manifest addressee
commitment is the unrealizability of the uptake, `PreferenceStructure.Consistent.realistic`,
relative to the speaker's information state `B` as in `Studies/CondoravdiLauer2012.lean`. Whom
a goal benefits is a primitive of the context, as in the paper, and the salient goal is a
parameter of the felicity condition. An offer or invitation is rendered as the speaker's
effective preference that any commitment of the addressee to the content be the addressee's
own, the paper's one-line derivation. The speaker's authority over the addressee, §2.2, does no
work in the paper's derivations and is not modeled; the wh-interrogative use, (3), and the
compound *bərə ka*, §4, are outside the paper's analysis.

## TODO

* The threat commissives of fn. 14 allow *bərə*; the paper leaves them unexplained.
