# Corbett's morphology of agreement

Agreement is the systematic covariance of one element's form with properties of another,
and it is asymmetric: the controller determines the target. Gender, number and person are
the indisputable agreement features because their values originate on the controller, gender
inherent to the noun, person to the pronoun, and number relating primarily to the noun; case
covaries within the noun phrase too, but is imposed on noun and modifier alike by a governor
outside it, and definiteness is imposed on the phrase as a whole, so neither is agreement.
The exponents of agreement are affixes before, after and inside the stem, and a target may
carry several for one controller; the features constrain one another, Russian distinguishing
gender only in the singular in conformity with Greenberg's universal, and their joint
expression may be fusional and syncretic, at its most spectacular in polarity, where the
Somali article of one gender in one number is that of the other gender in the other number.
The target then shapes agreement twice over. The forms available depend on its word class
and even its lexical class, Upper Sorbian finite verbs and participles agreeing in different
features and Latin adjective classes distinguishing three genders, two or none; and the form
selected may depend on
another target or on syncretism, conjoined Chichewa plurals taking the target form they share
rather than the resolved one. The chapter's examples are the rows of
`Data/Examples/Corbett1998.json`.

## Implementation notes

* The asymmetry criterion is read off where a covarying feature's value originates, the
  chapter's classification of the five dimensions carried as data; the Russian fragment
  records what each target is inflected for, and what a target agrees in is the inflected
  dimensions whose origin is the controller.
* Polarity is the substrate's `Gender.Polar`, which the Somali fragment proves of its
  article (Table 9.1); the verbal prefix is shown not to be polar, the plural prefix
  coinciding with the masculine singular's instead.
* Number-conditioned gender distinctions are the substrate's convergent maps between the
  target genders of two numbers; Chichewa's coordination rules are the substrate's ordered
  resolution rules over fragment nouns, one per target form before the semantic rule.
* The agreement slots of a target, their controllers and their bound of four are described
  in the rows and not modelled.

## TODO

* Nichols's hierarchy of the three features by their propensity to be marked only by
  agreement, the default-or-ungrammaticality outcomes of missing morphology, and the
  dependence of one target's form on another in Tigre, in Somali focus constructions and in
  German noun phrases are prose only.
* The Chichewa nouns carry no number, so the restriction of the shared-form rule to plural
  conjuncts, and the triggering of gender resolution by number resolution, are not stated.
* The syncretism claims are not stated over the cell-to-exponent tables of
  `Syntax/Agreement/Paradigm.lean`, whose cells are UD-typed where the carriers here are
  the languages' own.
