# Sloman, Barbey and Hotaling (2009): A Causal Model Theory of Cause, Enable, and Prevent

This file formalizes the causal model theory of [sloman-barbey-hotaling-2009]: the verbs refer
to the causal model of a discourse, and in the deterministic binary case their meanings are the
structural equations (2) to (4). *A causes B* asserts a link from A to B, `B := A`; *A enables B*
asserts a link, an accessory variable also linked to B, and A necessary for B, `B := A ∧ X`; and
*A prevents B* asserts a link along which A reduces B, `B := ¬A` with no accessory and `B := ¬A ∧ X`
or `B := ¬(A ∧ X)` with one. The verbs are
predicates on a causal model (`Causes`, `Enables`, `Prevents`), and the equations are models
(`causes`, `enables`, `prevents`, `preventsAnd`, `preventsNand`) that satisfy them
(`causes_Causes`, `enables_Enables`, `prevents_Prevents`, `preventsAnd_Prevents`,
`preventsNand_Prevents`). The paper's experiments follow from the equations: an effect follows
from its cause without any accessory, but from its enabler only once the accessory is settled
(Experiments 1 to 3, `causes_entails`, `enables_not_entails`, `enables_entails_of_accessory`),
and a one-link model is labelled *cause* while a two-link model is labelled *enable*
(Experiment 4, `not_enables_of_parents_eq_singleton`, `causes_not_Enables`). Two-premise
arguments are composed by substituting causes for effects, and the compositions the paper
works out come out as the equations it names: *causes* then *causes* is `C := A`
(`causesCauses_causes`), *allows* then *prevents*, or *allows* then *not B causes C*, is
`C := ¬(A ∧ X)`, the accessory form of *prevents* (`allowsPrevents_prevents`), *prevents* then
*prevents* is `C := A` (`preventsPrevents_causes`), and the three-premise argument of section
4.2 composes to `D := A` (`threePremise_causes`).

## Implementation notes

* A structural equation is a deterministic Boolean equation at the effect over its parents; the
  cause and the accessory variable are exogenous, read off the context. Entailment is strict
  causal entailment from an observation (`CausalModel.CausallyEntails`), on which an effect with
  an unsettled parent entails nothing: this is the paper's uncertainty when the accessory is
  unknown. Necessity is read in every context and under every intervention that leaves the
  effect open and turns the cause off: the effect is then off.
* The paper's experimental results stay in prose. In Experiments 1 to 3 confidence that the
  effect occurs was high only for a cause without an accessory and near the midpoint of the
  scale otherwise; in Experiment 4 one-link vignettes drew *cause* and two-link vignettes drew
  *enable*, *help* or *allow*. Of the sixteen two-premise argument forms of Goldvarg and
  Johnson-Laird's fourth experiment, the theory agrees with mental model theory on thirteen and
  predicts *A prevents C* for *allows* then *prevents* and for *allows* then *not B causes C*,
  and *A causes C* for *prevents* then *prevents*.
