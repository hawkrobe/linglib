# Wood (2015): Icelandic Morphosyntax and Argument Structure

This file formalizes [wood-2015]'s account of the Icelandic clitic *-st*. It is not an exponent
of Voice: it originates in an argument position, a specifier that it fills while contributing
nothing to the semantics, and cliticizes to the verb. It may merge in a specifier that imposes
no case requirement, so in SpecVoiceP and SpecpP but not in SpecApplP, which demands dative,
nor in a direct object position (`Position.AdmitsSt`). A θ-role introduced by a head is
saturated by a DP in its specifier or passed up to the next argument-introducing head; with
*-st* in its specifier a head passes its role up, and since Voice is the highest such head, a
Voice with *-st* in its specifier must be expletive (`VoiceP.expletive_of_st`), and an agentive
vP like *murder* has no *-st* anticausative (`VoiceP.no_st_of_thematic`). An anticausative
arises in two ways, specifierless Voice or Voice with a D feature checked by *-st*
(`VoiceP.anticausative_iff`), the expletive non-active and expletive active cells of the
substrate's typology (`VoiceP.cell_of_anticausative`); with thematic Voice, *-st* can only sit
lower, in SpecpP, where p's figure role passes up to the DP in SpecVoiceP, the figure reflexive
(`st_specP_of_thematic`). The alternation therefore lives in Voice over a fixed verb, where
[cuervo-2003] puts it in v with no Voice in the inchoative (`alternation_in_voice`,
`alternation_in_v`).

The morphology follows from locality: *-ka* spells out v in the context of listed roots and
*-na* spells out specifierless Voice in the context of listed roots, which requires Voice to
be adjacent to the root at spell-out, so v must be zero (`na_only_if_v_zero`). Hence *-na* and
*-ka* never co-occur, *-na* never co-occurs with *-st*, whose Voice carries a D feature, and
*-ka* is compatible with both (`na_ka_exclusive`, `na_st_exclusive`, `voiceExponent_ka`).

## Implementation notes

The word is a `Spine` over the heads v and Voice with v the only cyclic head, and the
allomorphy domain is the substrate's `SeesRoot`, adjacency across phonologically null heads.
The lists of roots for *-ka* and *-na* are parameters. Voice is a cell of `Minimalist.Voice`,
thematic when the vP is agentive, and its D feature is read from the cell. The reciprocal,
denominal, modal passive and *láta* constructions of the book's sixth chapter are recorded in
the examples.

/-! ### Where the alternation lives, against [cuervo-2003]

For Wood the two alternants of *opna* share the verb, root and v, and differ in Voice alone,
thematic against expletive; for [cuervo-2003] they differ in v, `vDO` against `vGO` over the
same state, and the inchoative has no Voice to vary. The two accounts are incompatible on the
locus of the alternation, and the substrate lets each be stated. -/

thematic active cell and the expletive active cell. -/
