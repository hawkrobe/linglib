# Groenendijk and Stokhof (1991): Dynamic Predicate Logic

This file formalizes the logical facts of [groenendijk-stokhof-1991], "Dynamic predicate
logic", in which a formula denotes a relation between assignments. The paper's semantics is
the update algebra of `Semantics/Dynamic/Update.lean`: conjunction is relational composition, the
existential is a random reset followed by its scope, and negation, implication, disjunction,
the universal, and closure are the tests of the conditions `neg`, `impl`, `disj`, `dforall`,
and `SetRel.dom`, which is the content of the paper's translation of discourse representation
theory. Only the quantifiers mention assignments, so the propositional laws are proved of
updates over any state type and the quantifier laws over any register structure.

The notions of section 3.2 come first: s-equivalence and p-equivalence, which equivalence
implies but which together do not imply it, and the tests, on which all three coincide.
Section 3.4 then supplies the laws. The connectives are definable from negation, conjunction,
and the existential but not conversely, since a negation is a test and an existential is one
only over a contradictory scope (`isTest_dexists_iff`); double negation, commutativity, and
idempotency of conjunction hold exactly of tests, while contraposition, currying, and the de
Morgan laws hold outright. An existential binds without limit to its right because composition
is associative (`scope_extension`), and it has universal force in an antecedent because
implication curries (`donkey_equivalence`). Section 3.5's dynamic entailment (`Entails`)
satisfies the deduction theorem and reduces s-entailment to entailment from the closed
premiss, and it is neither reflexive nor transitive, by the paper's own counterexamples. The
satisfaction set of an existential computed in the proof of Fact 19 is the cylindrification of
its scope's, in the cylindric set algebra of [henkin-monk-tarski-1971]; that is the substrate's
`dom_dexists`. The laws are then read off
for the formulas of `DPL/Syntax.lean` under their interpretation `DPL.Formula.eval`, and the
paper's opening contrast is computed: `∃x Px ∧ Qx` binds the last occurrence of `x`, while its
double negation and its alphabetic variant `∃y Py ∧ Qx` do not. Section 4.1's normal binding form
(`nbf`) is defined by structural recursion, Definition 24's rebracketing clauses being theorems
of it; a formula is equivalent to its normal binding form, which is scope-bound, so that the
dynamic truth conditions of any formula are the static ones of its normal binding form
(`dom_eval_eq_static_nbf`), which are the satisfaction of a mathlib first-order formula
(`mem_dom_eval_iff_realize_nbf`). Section 4.2's translation of discourse representation structures
(`DRT.DRS.toDPL`, Definition 28) preserves meaning: a condition becomes the test of its
verification and a box denotes its box relation (`DRT.DRS.eval_toDPL`, Fact 25).

## Implementation notes

The paper quantifies over models; an `Update S` fixes one, so its equivalence is equality of
relations, its contradiction is `∅`, and its counterexamples are stated over assignments into
a domain with two individuals, `[Nontrivial E]`. Truth with respect to an assignment and the
satisfaction set are both `SetRel.dom`, and the production set is `SetRel.cod`. That conditions
are tests, that tests are closed under conjunction, and that a test's production set is its
satisfaction set are the substrate's `isTest_test`, `IsTest.comp`, and `IsTest.cod_eq_dom`;
that closure and negation are idempotent on tests is `dom_test`. The paper lists idempotency
of disjunction as unconditional, but a disjunction is a test by Definition 2, so `φ ∨ φ` is the
closure of `φ` (`disj_self`) and the law holds exactly of tests. Fact 5, that a condition is a
test, is the substrate's `DPL.Formula.isTest_eval`. Fact 6, that the tests are the conditions
and the contradictions, holds up to equivalence, a test being equivalent to the condition `¬¬φ`
(`neg_neg_eq_self_iff_isTest`), and not of the syntactic class itself: `x = y ∧ ∃x[x = y]` is a
test in every structure and has an active quantifier (`isTest_eval_equal_conj_ex_equal`).

Definition 28 translates a discourse representation structure into a formula: a box becomes the
existential closure, over its referents, of the conjunction of its translated conditions, and
a complex condition the corresponding connective over its translated sub-boxes. Fact 25 says
the translation preserves meaning: a condition becomes a test of its verification, and a box
denotes its box relation `DRT.DRS.toRel`. -/
