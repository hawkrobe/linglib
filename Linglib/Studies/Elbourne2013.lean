# Elbourne (2013): Definite Descriptions

Elbourne gives the definite article a Fregean semantics over situations, the parts of possible
worlds ordered by parthood. The article takes a property and a situation and, if exactly one
thing has the property there, denotes that thing, so a description is a partial function from
situations to individuals. Its situation pronoun is free, referring to a situation the context
supplies, or bound by the abstractor of the containing proposition: free pronouns give Donnellan's
referential use and bound ones the attributive use. Binding the pronoun below an intensional
operator gives the de dicto reading, letting it refer to the actual world the de re reading, and
binding it above the operator Kripke's attributive yet de re reading. Under an attitude verb the
presupposition projects to the subject's beliefs, after Karttunen, and a donkey-anaphoric
description is bound to the minimal situations of its restrictor, which gives donkey sentences
their strong reading and a repeated description no sloppy reading.

## Main definitions

* `the`, `description`, `sentence`: the article, a description with its situation pronoun, and a
  sentence as a partial proposition.
* `deDicto`, `deRe`, `attributiveDeRe`, `attitude`: descriptions under intensional operators and
  attitude verbs.
* `Village`: situations as finite sets of atomic facts.

## Main results

* `sentence_presup`: a sentence presupposes exactly one satisfier at the situation its pronoun
  denotes.
* `deDicto_presup`, `deRe_presup`, `attributiveDeRe_assertion`: the three readings under an
  intensional operator.
* `attitude_inconsistent_of_agnostic`, `russellian_consistent`: the description, unlike its
  Russellian paraphrase, makes an agnostic subject's desire infelicitous.
* `everyOwnerBeatsTheDonkey_iff`, `incomplete_description`,
  `everyOwnerBeatsTheDonkeyAndThePriestToo_iff`: the strong donkey reading, incompleteness, and
  the strict reading of a repeated description in the village.

## Implementation notes

* Situations are any partial order; minimality is mathlib's `Minimal`, and the lexical entries of
  §2.3.3 are transcribed with it. The article is `iota` at the situation, so its domain
  condition is `∃!` (`the_isSome_iff`), and a sentence is `PartialProp.presupOfReferent` of the
  description. A situation pronoun is its value as a function of the situation the proposition
  is applied to, constant when free and the identity when bound. A description inside a scope
  contributes `∃ z ∈ the f s`, the assertion of `presupOfReferent` with `Option` membership.
* Intensional operators are universal over an accessibility relation and lift partial
  propositions by requiring presupposition and assertion throughout the accessible situations;
  attitude verbs check the presupposition in the subject's doxastic alternatives and the
  assertion in the verb's own, Karttunen's projection.
* The village of ch. 6 and ch. 9 is a concrete model: situations are finite sets of atomic
  facts ordered by inclusion, Kratzer's states of affairs, so minimal situations are
  computed and the strong reading of the donkey sentence is a theorem rather than a reading of
  the truth conditions.
* The examples are `Data.Examples.Elbourne2013`.

## TODO

* Ch. 4's projection through possibility modals, disjunction and negation, ch. 7's modal
  subordination and counterfactuals, and ch. 10's descriptive indexicals are not represented.

with one table. The referential situation pronoun to the room satisfies the domain condition
although the world contains two tables. -/
