# Deal (2011): Modals without scales

This file formalizes [deal-2011]'s account of the Nez Perce modal *o'qa*, used where English
uses a possibility modal and where it uses a necessity modal in upward-entailing contexts, but
only where it uses a possibility modal elsewhere. *O'qa* is a possibility modal without a Horn
scale: two modals form a scale only when they quantify over the same domain, sharing a type of
modality, and no stronger Nez Perce modal shares *o'qa*'s (§2). A possibility claim without a
scalar implicature holds whenever there are accessible worlds of the prejacent, even when all
accessible worlds are, so in an upward-entailing context *o'qa* serves for both forces (§1).
Under negation the necessity claim is the weaker one, and *o'qa* serves only where a possibility
modal of English does (§3).

The claims are [kratzer-1981]'s simple possibility and necessity, and negation acts on them by
complement, the negative `Polarity`. A modal is appropriate where its claim holds and, if it has
a scalemate, the scalemate's claim fails when it is the stronger one there (`Appropriate`). The
contexts a modal serves for are then fixed by whether it has a scalemate and which claim is
stronger (`servesFor_iff`), and Table 1 follows (`flexible_iff`): a modal with a scale is
inflexible, a scale-free possibility modal is flexible only in upward-entailing contexts, and a
scale-free necessity modal only in downward-entailing ones.

## Implementation notes

* Forces are compared on the classical scale, weak necessity counting as necessity; the claims
  are simple possibility and necessity over a consistent modal base, with no ordering source.
* Negation stands in for the downward-entailing contexts of §3, the restrictions of universals
  and conditional antecedents, whose rows the `environment` feature marks; the paper treats
  conditional antecedents as not upward-entailing, leaving their monotonicity open (fn. 12).
* The rows are *o'qa*'s judgments by the force of the English modal of the context or
  translation. (11) and (12), where speakers find *o'qa* too weak a translation of a necessity
  claim, bear on the preference for possibility translations, which the paper attributes to
  *o'qa*'s being a possibility modal; they are not rows.
