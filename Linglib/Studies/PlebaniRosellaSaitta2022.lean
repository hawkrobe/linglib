# Plebani, Rosella and Saitta (2022): Truthmakers, incompatibility, and modality

Plebani, Rosella and Saitta build truthmaker semantics on a primitive, symmetric relation of exact
incompatibility between states in place of Fine's primitive set of possible states. Two states are
inexactly incompatible when a part of one is exactly incompatible with a part of the other
(`Truthmaker.Conflict`) and compatible otherwise, and a state is possible when it is compatible
with itself (`Truthmaker.possible`). Compatibility passes to parts (Claim 1,
`Truthmaker.Conflict.mono`), and a state is possible exactly when its parts are pairwise
compatible (Claim 2, `Truthmaker.mem_possible_iff_forall`). In the canonical model a literal is
exactly incompatible with its mirror image, and the possible states are the consistent sets of
literals (`Truthmaker.Canonical.possible_excl`).

A state is maximal with respect to compatibility when it contains every state compatible with it
(`MaximalCompat`), and maximal with respect to parthood when no possible state properly contains
it. The first implies the second (`maximal_of_maximalCompat`, Claim 3) but not conversely
(`maximal_counterExcl`, `not_maximalCompat_counterExcl`). Fine's condition that compatible states
have a possible fusion restores the converse (`maximalCompat_of_maximal`, Claim 4), but it makes
the null state incompatible with every impossible state (`conflict_bot_of_not_mem_possible`).
Possible Fusion instead equates maximality with respect to parthood with a weaker maximality with
respect to compatibility (`maximal_iff_weakMaximalCompat`, Claim 5).

The falsifiers of an atomic formula are the states exactly incompatible with all its verifiers,
and the connectives follow Fine's bilateral clauses (`denote`). Every verifier of a formula is
then inexactly incompatible with every falsifier (`conflict_of_mem_ver_of_mem_fal`, Theorem 1), so
no possible state verifies a contradiction (`not_mem_possible_of_mem_ver_conj_neg`, Corollary 1).

## Implementation notes

States form a complete lattice. Maximality with respect to parthood is mathlib's `Maximal` among
the possible states, which is the paper's definition for possible states, the only ones its claims
about it concern. The applications to first-degree entailment, the Routley star and Kripke frames
(§§4–5) are not formalized.
