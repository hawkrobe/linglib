# Larson (1988): On the Double Object Construction

This file formalizes the analysis of [larson-1988]: a ditransitive verb projects a VP shell, the
oblique dative *send a letter to Mary* is built by merging the *to*-phrase as the complement
and the theme as the inner specifier, and the double object construction is derived from it by
the operation of Passive applied within the VP, an internal merge of the indirect object above
the theme. The derivations are `SyntacticObject.Derivation`s whose movement steps are the same
internal-merge step as the clausal passive, and the c-command relations of the resulting trees
give the asymmetries of [barss-lasnik-1986]: in the oblique dative the theme c-commands the goal
(`oblique_do_ccommands_goal`), in the double object construction the indirect object
c-commands the theme and not conversely (`doc_io_ccommands_do`, `doc_do_not_ccommands_io`),
as the promoted object c-commands the demoted subject of a passive. Dative shift is subject to
recoverability: the content of *to* must be recoverable from the verb's own assignment of a goal
role (`recoverable`), which separates *give* and *send* from *donate* and *contribute*. The
indirect passive *Mary was sent a letter* is derived by dative shift followed by passive.

## Implementation notes

The oblique dative and dative shift are the paper's second and third sections, the indirect
passive its fourth, and recoverability the second part of its fifth. The head movement of the verb
from the inner to the outer shell is not modelled, since the c-command facts depend only on the
positions of the arguments; each derivation is paired with the planar tree it produces, on which
c-command is decided. The recoverability entries record the roles the paper assigns to each
verb's indirect object.

/-! ### Dative shift

*John sent Mary a letter* extends the oblique dative by one step, the internal merge of the
indirect object from inside the *to*-phrase to the edge of the inner shell, the operation of
Passive within the VP. The indirect object thereby comes to c-command the theme, which gives the
six asymmetries of [barss-lasnik-1986]: anaphor binding, quantifier–pronoun binding, weak
crossover, superiority, *each … the other*, and negative polarity licensing. -/

/-! ### Recoverability (§5.2)

Dative shift requires the content of *to* to be recoverable from the verb: both the verb and
*to* assign a role to the indirect object, and when the verb's roles include the goal role that
*to* contributes, *to* reduces to a case marker that Passive can absorb; a verb that assigns
only a beneficiary role leaves *to*'s contribution unrecoverable, and dative shift is blocked.
