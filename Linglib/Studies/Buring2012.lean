# Büring (2012): Pronouns

This file formalizes the semantics of definite pronouns in Büring's handbook survey, as theorems
about the project's pronoun denotation applied to the English Fragment's entries. A pronoun is
indexed and denotes the value its index has under the assignment; bound, anaphoric and deictic uses
share that one denotation, so a binder is an external operator manipulating the assignment rather
than a second lexical entry. The φ-features are presuppositions on the resolved referent: *she*
picks out the assignment value only when that value is a singular female, *I* only when it
includes the agent of the context, and each is undefined, neither true nor false, merely
infelicitous, otherwise. The unmarked feature values contribute nothing, so a pronoun that
carries only unmarked values is defined of any referent at all. That is the survey's
underspecification treatment of *they*, whose gender-neutrality is the absence of a gender
feature rather than a feature of its own.

## Main results

* `selector_eq_assignment` — a pronoun denotes the assignment value at its index.
* `undefined_of_non_female`, `undefined_of_not_agent` — a feminine entry is undefined of a
  non-female referent, a first-person entry of one not including the agent.
* `defined_of_unmarked_features` — an entry with only unmarked values imposes no condition.
* `they_defined_where_she_undefined` — the two English entries at a male referent.
* `bound_reading` — binding is an assignment update, with the entry's denotation unchanged.

/-- An entry carrying only unmarked values — third person, plural, no gender — restricts the
referent to nothing, so it is defined wherever any pronoun is. Unmarked values are the absence of

avoid a gender specification. -/

index, and the unchanged denotation then returns the binder. There is no bound-pronoun lexeme. -/
