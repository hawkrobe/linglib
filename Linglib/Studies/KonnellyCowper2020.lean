# Konnelly and Cowper (2020): Gender Diversity and Morphosyntax

This file formalizes [konnelly-cowper-2020]'s account of singular *they* as a grammatical
change in three stages. A third-person pronoun spells out a bundle of privative features by
the Elsewhere Principle, the vocabulary items of (11) being *she* for [sg][fem], *he* for
[sg][masc], *it* for [sg, inanim] and *they* elsewhere (`items`, `spellout`); the items are
constant across the stages, and what changes is which features a pronoun's antecedent
projects. On the structure (14), [sg] and [inanim] sit on Num and are always copied to the
pronoun, while the gender feature on n is copied only optionally under a quantifier, which is
why (12) *every girl … their* is fine and (13) *every book … their* is not (`quantified`). At
Stage 1, [masc] and [fem] are contrastive and a noun referring to a person of known gender
obligatorily bears one, so *they* needs an antecedent of unknown gender or a quantifier, (5).
At Stage 2 the features are still contrastive but the insertion rule is optional, so an
ungendered name like *Kelly* antecedes *they*, (6), while a lexically gendered noun does not,
(15) and (21). At Stage 3 the features are the non-contrastive modifiers of [wiltschko-2008],
the substrate's `Contrastivity`, so *they* is the default for any singular animate antecedent,
(7) and (25), with *he* and *she* still available, (8), and *it* still forced for inanimates,
(10) (`Stage.genders`, `forms`, `stage3_they`, `it_of_inanimate`). Against
[bjorkman-2017]'s dynamic condition, which asks a pronoun's features to include its
antecedent's, (24) *the women said that she was leaving* is wrongly licensed, whereas the
number contrast excludes it here (`bjorkman_overgenerates`, `women_not_she`).

## Implementation notes

* An antecedent records what the pronoun sees: the Num features, the gender feature n bears
  lexically, the referent's known binary gender that the insertion rule may add, and whether
  D hosts a quantifier. Stage 3's modifier, when present, is the referent's gender, as in
  (26).
