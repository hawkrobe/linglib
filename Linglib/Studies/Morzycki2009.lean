# Morzycki (2009): Degree Modification of Gradable Nouns

This file formalizes Morzycki's account of the degree readings of size adjectives, *big idiot*
as a very idiotic person. A gradable noun denotes a measure function from individuals to
degrees, and its positive form holds of the individuals that reach the noun's standard (`pos`).
A size adjective in a degree reading is the argument of an adnominal degree head, the nominal
counterpart of the head that combines an adjective with a measure phrase (`meas`): the
individual's degree must reach the least degree the size adjective is true of, and also the
noun's standard (`measN`). The resulting predicate is the positive form with the standard
raised to that least degree (`measN_eq_pos_sup`).

The Bigness Generalization, that only adjectives of bigness license degree readings, follows.
Antonyms measure along oppositely ordered scales, so the bottom of the noun's scale counts as
small wherever the standard of smallness lies, the least small degree is the bottom, and
*small idiot* is *idiot* (`measN_small`), whereas the least big degree properly raises a lower
standard (`measN_ssubset_pos`). The degree head *complete* requires the maximum of the noun's
scale and so combines only with nouns whose scales have one (`hasMax_of_complete_nonempty`).

## Implementation notes

The scale of a gradable noun is the whole degree type, so the restriction of the least degree
to the noun's scale is left implicit. The Position Generalization, that degree readings arise
only attributively, is imposed by the syntax of the nominal degree projection and is not
represented, and neither are the degree heads *real*, *true*, *total* and *absolute*.
