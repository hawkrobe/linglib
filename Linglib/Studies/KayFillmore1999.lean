# Kay and Fillmore (1999): The What's X Doing Y? Construction

This file formalizes the construction of [kay-fillmore-1999], *What's X doing Y?*, whose
interrogative form conventionally conveys that someone judges the scene `Y(X)` incongruous
(their gloss (39)), a meaning the paper argues is neither a conversational implicature of an
innocent question (Section 2.2) nor a proposition that negation could apply to
(Section 4.6). The construction is `wxdyConstruction`, the flat rendering of the paper's
Figure 12: BE and *doing* are fixed heads, *what* is a fixed and left-isolated object that binds
the reference of nothing, *doing* and `Y` share the scene judged incongruous, and *doing* may
not be negated, a stipulation the paper reports being unable to deduce. `X` is not unified with
`Y`: coinstantiation, twice, unifies it with the subject requirements of *doing* and of `Y`, so
that it becomes the subject argument of the predication `Y(X)` (`wxdy_coinstantiation`).

The grammatical evidence for the construction in Section 2.3 is derived by the licensing
recognizer over the paper's minimal pairs: the canonical (3a) and the stative (14a) are
licensed, while the bare-stem *do* of (12a), *doing* as complement of *keep* in (13a),
*what else* in (15f), and the negated *doing* of (17b) are not, negation inside `Y` in (17c)
being fine. The coinstantiation construction of Figure 13 is recorded as a fully abstract form
with one unification index.

## Implementation notes

The paper's semantics, the incongruity-judgment frame of Figure 12 with a contextually
anchored judge, is not represented beyond the construction's pragmatic point; its inheritance
from the left-isolation, subject–auxiliary inversion and wh-interrogative constructions of the
paper's unification grammar is recorded in prose only.

/-! ### The construction (Figure 12) -/

/-- The WXDY construction, the flat rendering of Figure 12. BE governs the complement *doing*,
which cannot be negated (Section 4.6) and governs the object WXDY-*what*, left-isolated and not
an operator binding the reference of anything, and the complement `Y`, a predicate phrase of any
category. The semantics of *doing* and of `Y` bear #1, the scene judged incongruous, and the
subject requirement of `Y` bears #2, the argument of its frame. `X`, the subject of BE, bears
#2 because coinstantiation unifies it with the subject requirements of *doing* and of `Y`
(Section 4.2, Figure 13). -/
