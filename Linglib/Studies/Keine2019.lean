# Keine (2019): Selective Opacity

This file formalizes the horizons account of selective opacity of [keine-2019]: a syntactic
domain may be opaque to some operations and transparent to others (their (1)), and the constraint
is on the searches of probes, each terminated by a category of its own, its horizon ((38)),
rather than on domains or on the moving element. With category inheritance within an extended
projection ((43)) a clause's label collects the categories it projects, so a clause is opaque to a
probe exactly when its label contains the horizon, and Upward Entailment ((40)), that larger
clauses are at least as opaque, is the Horizon Inheritance Theorem ((45), (46)), transparency
antitone in the extension order of clause sizes (`sizes_le`). The Hindi probes of (48) and (57),
φ-agreement and A-movement on T⁰ with
horizon T, wh-licensing on C⁰ with horizon C and Ā-movement on C⁰ without one, derive the
transparency table (58) with its three locality types (`transparency_table`) and with it the
generalizations (21) and (23) on long-distance agreement; English hyperraising is A-movement
with horizon C (Section 4.2.3), and its availability elsewhere is the absence of that horizon
(`hyperraising_iff`).

The Height-Locality Connection ((33), (62)), that higher probes search into more kinds of
structure, is derived rather than stipulated: a probe whose horizon lies below its position finds
it in its sister and is vacuous ((63)), so for a nonvacuous probe the position bounds the horizon
and the horizon bounds the position, the Height-Locality Theorem ((65)) instantiated for Hindi in
(66) and (67).

## Implementation notes

Labels are the bilateral labels of the substrate's `ClauseSpine`s and transparency is
`Probe.Profile.TransparentTo`; the article's probes are defined here, and vacuity is
`Probe.Profile.IsVacuous`, which takes the sister of a probe on C⁰ to be TP and of one on T⁰ to
be vP.

/-- (45), (46): Upward Entailment follows from category inheritance. The three clause sizes
stand in the extension order, TP extending vP and CP extending TP, and transparency is antitone
in that order for every probe (`Probe.Profile.transparentTo_label_antitone`), so a probe blocked
by a clause is blocked by every larger one. -/

/-- The four Hindi probes are nonvacuous, so the two on C⁰ search into TP and vP clauses and the
two on T⁰ into vP clauses, which is why nonfinite clauses are no islands for Ā-movement or
wh-licensing and why only these interact with long-distance agreement as (21) says; and the
A-probe's horizon T would make it vacuous on C⁰, so A-movement lands inside nonfinite clauses,
(66) and (67). -/
