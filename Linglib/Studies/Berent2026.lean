# Berent (2026): Three arguments for abstraction in phonology

This file formalizes Berent's three experimental arguments that phonological grammar is
substance-free. Phonology is *abstract* (§3.1): onsets with large sonority rises are
preferred to small rises, these to plateaus, and these to falls, as in blif, bnif, bdif and
lbif, and the preference survives print presentation and the suppression of the lips or
the tongue. It is *algebraic* (§3.2): the Hebrew ban on roots that begin with two
identical consonants extends to /θ/, which Hebrew lacks, and the preference of ASL signers
for reduplication extends to unattested handshapes. It is *amodal* (§3.3): English
speakers project the doubling restrictions of their spoken language onto novel ASL signs.

Each property is stated as an invariance. The markedness of an onset is its sonority rise,
which depends on the two segments only through the major-class features that sonority
reads, so it is blind to the articulator that the suppression experiments manipulate.
Identity restrictions are invariant under any injective relabelling of the elements they
compare, so they cannot distinguish attested from unattested feature values. The doubling
reversal of `Studies/BerentEtAl2016.lean` holds over an arbitrary type of prosodic
constituents, spoken or signed.

## Main definitions

* `onsetRise`: the sonority rise across a two-consonant onset of feature-specified segments.
* `InitialIdentity`: a consonantal root begins with two identical consonants.

## Main results

* `sonority_cline`: the onsets of blif, bnif, bdif and lbif are a large rise, a small rise,
  a plateau and a fall.
* `onsetRise_congr`, `onsetRise_setFeature_left`: the rise is unchanged by any difference
  outside `Sonority.features`, and the labial onsets of plik, pnik and ptik pattern with
  those of blif, bnif and bdif.
* `initialIdentity_map`, `optimal_morphology_map`: the root restriction and the preference
  for reduplication give the same verdict on a form and on its image under an injective
  relabelling.
* `amodal_doubling_reversal`: the doubling reversal holds for any type of constituents and
  either ranking of the OCP and DEP.

## Implementation notes

The paper states the syllable hierarchy without a constraint set, deferring the formal
analysis to earlier work, so the hierarchy is the order on sonority rises and no tableau
is built. The acoustic, articulatory and neural measures of Figure 1 are not modelled.
