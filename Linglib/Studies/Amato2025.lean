# Nested Agree and apparent minimality violations: [amato-2025]

[amato-2025] derives apparent minimality violations from *Nested Agree*
(Definition (1)): the probes on a head are extrinsically ordered, and a later
probe must exploit the dependency an earlier one established, so its search
starts from the earlier probe's goal — everything the head c-commands above
that goal lies outside its domain, and a structurally closer matching goal is
skipped with minimality respected at every step. `run` is that engine on the
substrate's `FeatureBundle` slots and `Probe.search`: a probe's domain is the
c-command-ordered list of accessible heads (the paper's own notation in (6),
(8), (32), (34)), read off a projection spine by `domain`, which stops at a
phase head's complement (PIC); a valued probe (a case assigner, `[∗Infl:perf∗]`)
matches only an unvalued slot and values its goal, an unvalued probe matches
any specified slot and is valued by an active goal (fn. 23, defective
intervention).

The paper's derivations then run as stated: Standard Italian auxiliary
selection ((9)–(20), over the substrate's `TransitivityClass` and impersonal/passive
`Voice.Flavor`) under the Vocabulary Items (14), the Ariellese and Tufillese orderings and entries
(22)–(24), the ditransitive case/agreement alignments (25)–(28) with
[barany-2024]'s typological gap, Icelandic DAT-NOM (29a/b), Lak perfective
agreement (32), Spanish VOS (34), Bulgarian multiple wh-fronting (36), and
Hindi-Urdu (38)–(40). Out of scope: Merge and binding inside v's cycle (the SCC
ordering of (16)–(17) enters as v's input), participle agreement (§4.3.2), and
the Appendix's comparison with MME, Multitasking and ECoMPS.

/-- Goal `g` matches the probe at dimension `t` on `α` (fn. 23): an unvalued probe

each probe searches for its closest matching goal from the previous probe's goal on —
