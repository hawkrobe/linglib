# Arnold, Wasow, Losongco & Ginstrom 2000: heaviness vs. newness

Postverbal constituent order in English — heavy NP shift and the dative alternation — has
been attributed to grammatical weight (Behaghel's law of growing constituents) and to
discourse status (given before new), but the two are confounded: given referents get short
expressions and new ones long. A corpus study of the Aligned-Hansard debates and an
elicitation experiment in which directors instruct actors to give objects to toy animals
measure heaviness as the difference in word count between the two constituents and newness
by prior mention, and find that both factors independently shift the order, the newer and
heavier constituent coming later, with neither reducible to the other. Their relative
strength varies with the data: heaviness dominates where length differences are large,
newness where the given referent has just been mentioned — a system of interacting
constraints whose strength grows as the competing constraint weakens. Speakers' early
disfluencies favour goal-first orders, so the postponement of new and heavy material serves
planning as well as comprehension.

The two factors are read as weighted constraints over the two orders of a constituent pair:
a graded penalty for putting the heavier constituent first, sized by the length difference the
paper measures, and a penalty for putting a new constituent before a given one. The harmony
difference between the orders is the weighted sum of the two signed preferences, which is
the additive independence the paper reports; the paper's interaction is a matter of effect
size in the data and is not represented.

## Main definitions

* `Phrase`, `Pair`, `Order`: a constituent by word count and givenness, a postverbal pair,
  and which constituent comes last.
* `heavyFirst`, `newFirst`: the two constraints; `con` their weighted family.
* `heavyDiff`, `newDiff`: each constraint's signed preference for the theme-last order.
