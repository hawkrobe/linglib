# Zuraw and Hayes (2017): Intersecting Constraint Families

This file formalizes the Tagalog case of [zuraw-hayes-2017]'s argument for Harmonic Grammar.
Nasal substitution is conditioned by two families of constraints (§2.4): the consonant-sensitive
markedness constraints (3), (4), (6), and the Uniformity constraints (5), one for each of the six
prefix constructions. Every square crossing two prefixes with two stems is independent in the
sense of the substrate: each constraint is insensitive to the prefix or to the stem
(`independent`). The rates of application show across-the-board effects in both dimensions,
restrained by floor and ceiling effects (§2.3); Harmonic Grammar predicts the pattern because
constraint effects add.

In MaxEnt the probability of substitution is logistic in the harmony difference (13)
(`maxentSubst_eq`), the logit rates have constant differences on every square
(`maxent_predicts_hz`), and so the effects of prefixes and of stems are across the board on
every square, for every weighting (`maxent_acrossTheBoard`). In Noisy Harmonic Grammar the noise
on a comparison grows with the number of constraints that distinguish the candidates, four for
/p/ as in (15) (`violationDiffSqSum_p`); since that number depends on the stem alone, the
effects of the prefixes are across the board on every square, for every weighting and noise
(`nhg_acrossTheBoard`). A decision-tree model instead multiplies a prefix probability by a stem
probability, so the stem differences grow with the prefix probability, the paper's claws
(`decision_tree_monotonic_diff`).

Stochastic OT fails differently (§3.8). When a lone constraint opposes two synergistic families
that each apply through one constraint, as in the French liaison and elision data, generation is
a race: the opposing constraint's candidate wins when that constraint outruns the other two
(`raceRate`). By a theorem of Magri's that the paper reports, the difference that a stronger
constraint of one family makes then grows monotonically as the constraint of the other family
weakens (`raceRate_add_le`, `antitone_raceRate_sub`) and vanishes as it strengthens
(`tendsto_raceRate_atTop`): the rates converge in one direction and diverge in the other. In
Harmonic Grammar's tug-of-war the difference vanishes in both directions
(`not_antitone_not_monotone_sigmoid_sub`).

## Implementation notes

* The inputs are the thirty-six crossings of the six prefix constructions of Figure 3 with the
  six stem-initial consonants of [zuraw-2010]; its /t/ stands for the paper's t/s class.
* The constraints are those of Table 1, in its order, the consonant-sensitive ones pulled back
  from [zuraw-2010] along the projection of a candidate onto its stem and decision.
* Magri's theorem is proved for noise of any law, stochastic OT's Gaussian noise among them: the
  opposing candidate's rate integrates, against the law of its constraint, the product of the
  other two constraints' distribution functions (`rumChoiceProb_eq_lintegral`), and that product
  has increasing differences in the two ranking values.
* The paper's fitted weights and ranking values, their log likelihoods, the empirical rates, the
  French and Hungarian data, and the partial-ordering model are not represented.
