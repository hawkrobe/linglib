# Schlenker (2004b): Sequence Phenomena and Double Access Readings Generalized

This file formalizes the chapter's two remarks. The first is that sequence of tense is one
instance of an agreement mechanism shared by person, tense and mood. An attitude verb quantifies
over the contexts compatible with the attitude, an embedded argument read de se is a coordinate
of the bound context variable, and the features it is pronounced with are copied from the
arguments of the embedding verb by the formation rule (22) (`Features.ofArgs`) without being
interpreted. The fragment of Appendix A is given as terms carrying features (`Term`,
`TimeTerm`), formulas with the attitude construction (`Formula`), and their value and
definedness at an assignment and an utterance context. A de se report then has the truth
conditions of (13b) and inherits no presupposition from its embedded features, whereas
interpreting a person, tense or mood feature on a coordinate makes its presupposition project
universally over the attitude's contexts, which the examples (16), (19) and (21) refute
(`past_coord_weird`, `ind_coord_not_weird_iff`). Features are transmitted unchanged down a chain
of attitudes, also through a future auxiliary, which (22) keeps out of agreement
(`Features.ofArgs_coord_fut`), as the example (24) of [kamp-rohrer-1983] requires.

The second remark generalizes the upper limit constraint of [abusch-1997] from tense to mood.
After the de re transformation a tense or mood denotes a description of times or worlds relative
to the local context, and the coordinate of that context is an upper limit for it: a time
description may not lie entirely after the context's time, and a world description must contain
its world, one constraint for both (`ULC`). Double access for tense follows as in Abusch, and the
same argument yields its modal counterpart, the reading on which the agent's thought is about the
actual world as well as the world of the thought act (`doubleAccess_of_ulc`,
`worldDoubleAccess_of_ulc`), both instances of `Tense.DoubleAccess`.

## Implementation notes

* Failure of denotation is a definedness predicate beside a total value rather than a partial
  denotation, and the diacritic of a context variable is read off the enclosing attitude's
  arguments by (22) rather than stored on its coordinates, so the feature a term is pronounced
  with is the feature appearing in it. Disjunction is omitted. Vividness of descriptions is left
  to the hypotheses of the double access theorems.
* The chapter states the upper limit constraint for present and past time terms and indicative
  world terms only; the constraint here is on descriptions, and which terms it applies to is
  left to its application.
