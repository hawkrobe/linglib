# Roberts and Özyıldız (2025): A causal explanation for the contrafactive gap

This file formalizes the paper's explanation of the absence of contrafactive predicates, verbs
that would presuppose the falsity of their complement while asserting belief in it. The
Predicate Lexicalization Constraint requires the presupposition of a predicate to be causally
upstream of its at-issue content in the normative model of belief formation, a causal chain
running from one variable to another when altering the first can alter the second,
`Upstream`. In the belief-formation model a fact generates indicators
for itself, experience of an indicator is acquaintance with it, acquaintance forms belief, and
a fact generates no indicator for its negation, `beliefModel`; the truth of a proposition
therefore manipulates belief in it, `know_plc`, whereas its falsity does not, `contra_plc`,
which is the gap. Predicates carrying the contrafactive inference are eventive: the Dutch
deception verb *wijsmaken* and *hallucinate* satisfy the constraint through an intervening
node of deception or distortion, `wijsmaken_plc`, and cutting that node returns the deficient
configuration. The postsuppositional Mandarin yǐwéi lies outside the constraint, so the
attestation table of [glass-2025] follows, `attested_iff`.

## Implementation notes

Models are deterministic Boolean causal models whose exogenous variables are the fields of a
context. The paper's first link makes the fact sufficient but not necessary for its indicators;
in the normative model, without forged evidence, the indicator copies the fact. The normative
context makes the experience conditions true and every other exogenous variable false, and the
manipulation test intervenes on the presupposed fact alone. The paper's causal chain is a template
over the choice of proposition and attitude holder, and the model is that template.

/-- The hypothetical *contra* violates the constraint: the falsity of the complement does not
manipulate belief in it, because a fact generates indicators only for itself, so no path runs
from the falsity to the belief. -/

/-- The constraint's verdict on the profiles of [glass-2025]: for a factive and for the
hypothetical strong contrafactive, whether the presupposed fact manipulates belief in the
complement; a nonfactive presupposes nothing and yǐwéi's falsity inference is a
postsupposition on the output context, so the constraint does not apply. -/
