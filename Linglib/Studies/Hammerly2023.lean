# Hammerly (2023): A set-based semantics for person, obviation, and animacy

[hammerly-2023] derives the person partitions from bivalent features denoting first-order
predicates, following the contrastive account of [cowper-hall-2019]. A feature denotes a set of
ontological primitives, [Author] the speaker and [Participant] the speaker and the addressee
(21), and composes with a lattice of referents by keeping those containing some member of that
set or those containing none (24). Which features are active, and how they are read, follows from
the successive division algorithm (26): a learner divides the inventory feature by feature until
every category is distinguished, and a feature applies only where it makes a contrast (28), (29).
Under [+Author] the participant feature makes no contrast, since every referent there contains
the speaker, so a learner facing a clusivity contrast narrows it to [Participant*], 'includes a
participant other than the speaker', in effect an addressee feature (p. 55). The account derives
all and only the five partitions of [harbour-2016] (p. 55). Since [Participant] and
[Participant*] are never active together, the tripartition grouping inclusive with second person,
which a free addressee feature would generate, is excluded ((60), p. 72).

## Main definitions

* `Hammerly2023.Feature`: [Author], [Participant] and the narrowed [Participant*].
* `Hammerly2023.divide`, `Hammerly2023.sda`: the successive division algorithm.
* `Hammerly2023.Admissible`: a contrastive hierarchy whose features all contrast and whose
  narrowing is licensed.

## Main results

* `image_graph_sda_eq_geometry`: the admissible hierarchies derive exactly the partitions
  Harbour's bivalent geometry (9) generates, his five.
* `sda_participant_author`, `sda_author_participantStar`: the hierarchies of Figures 4 and 5,
  the tripartition and the quadripartition.
* `not_admissible_participant_participantStar`, `not_admissible_participantStar`: narrowing
  alongside the wide feature, or where the wide feature contrasts, is not licensed.

## Implementation notes

Only the core persons of §3 are formalized, on participant sets, with the obviation and animacy
features of §4 left aside. A hierarchy is a list of features, its order the contrastive scope;
since the features denote first-order predicates, their order of composition does not matter
(p. 52). Narrowing is licensed where the wide [Participant] would leave some cell undivided,
the situation of the [+Author] cell in Figure 5.
