# Ramotowska, Marty, Romoli, and Santorio (2025): Counterfactuals and Quantificational Force

This file formalizes [ramotowska-marty-romoli-santorio-2025]'s comparison of three theories of
counterfactuals on quantified sentences in mixed scenarios, where some but not all of the
players would have won. The universal theory of [lewis-1973] and [kratzer-2012] quantifies over
the closest antecedent worlds (2); the selectional theory of [stalnaker-1968] evaluates the whole
sentence at a selected world and supervaluates over the candidate selections after composition
(5); the
homogeneity theory of [von-fintel-1997] and [kriz-2015] gives each counterfactual a third
status during composition (6). Unembedded, the last two agree that a single player's
counterfactual has a third status and the first calls it false (Table 1, `unembedded`).
Embedded under a quantifier they part ways: the universal theory makes the sentence turn on its
polarity (`universal_polarity`), the selectional theory on its quantificational force, the
universal sentences false and the existential ones true whatever the question under discussion
(`selectional_force`), and the homogeneity theory leaves every quantified sentence undefined
under either projection algorithm (`homogeneity_undefined`), so that only there is a gap for a
question under discussion to resolve, as it does for the plural definite of the same scenario
(`dissociation`). The implicature variant of [bassi-bar-lev-2018] (§8) mispredicts *some* and
*not all* (`implicature_some`, `implicature_notAll`). The paper's two experiments find the force
effect and no effect of the question under discussion on counterfactuals, alongside a question
effect on plural definites, the pattern of the selectional theory.

## Implementation notes

A scenario is a similarity ordering, an antecedent, and one consequent per player. Mixedness is
stated as the paper's setting has it: every closest antecedent world has a winner and a loser,
and every player wins in one closest world and loses in another. The homogeneity theory's
projection through a quantifier is the Kleene aggregation of the players' trivalent values,
conjunctive or disjunctive over the values or their negations; the paper notes that the choice
makes no difference when every instance is undefined, and its Table 3 row for that theory,
which rests on a pragmatic resolution of undefinedness by the question under discussion, is
not derived. Force is the paper's binary, universal against existential, which differs from the
weak/strong labels of [barwise-cooper-1981] on *no*. The mean ratings and mixed-effects models
of §5 and §6 are not restated.
