# Giorgolo and Asudeh (2012): ⟨M, η, ⋆⟩ Monads for Conventional Implicatures

Giorgolo and Asudeh treat conventional implicature as the side effect of a Writer monad: an
expression denotes a computation that yields its at-issue value and logs the side-issue
propositions of its parts. Since bind passes its continuation only the value and only extends the
log, no lexical item can read or revise the side-issue dimension, as Potts's restriction on the
flow of information demands and as the impossible modifier *negex* of Barker, Bernardi and Shan
would. Presupposition triggers log their conditions in a second Writer layer. In "John, who likes
cats, likes dogs also" the implicature entails the presupposition once the computation has ended,
which is the paper's reply to the case of AnderBois, Brasoveanu and Henderson against
multidimensionality.

## Main definitions

* `M`: the two-channel monad, conventional implicatures over presuppositions.
* `write`, `check`: logging an implicature and a presuppositional condition.

## Main results

* `seq_eq_bind_bind`: Shan's application (15) is the monad's `<*>`.
* `Ex20.atIssue_sentence`, `Ex20.ciLog_sentence`, `Ex20.presupLog_sentence`: the three
  dimensions of Figure 1.
* `Ex20.presupposition_of_ci`: the implicature entails the presupposition.
* `Ex20.atIssue_sentence_congr`: the relative clause never reaches the at-issue value.

## Implementation notes

* The two channels are the transformer `WriterT (List CI) (Writer (List Presup))`, over the Writer
  surface of `Semantics/Composition/Writer.lean`, with `check` lifted from the presupposition
  monad as fn. 4 prescribes. The paper's logs are sets under union; these are lists.
* Glue's `⊸` elimination is the monad's `<*>`, and `⊸*` elimination plain application to monadic
  arguments; the introduction rules, which reason hypothetically, are not needed.
* The extension of *like* is a parameter: the presupposition of *also* follows from the logged
  implicature alone, given that cats are not dogs.

`A(f)(x) = f ⋆ λg. x ⋆ λy. η(g y)`, which is the monad's `<*>`; the value is the application and
both logs are threaded. -/
