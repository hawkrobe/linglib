# Lechner (2004): Ellipsis in comparatives

This file formalizes two of Lechner's binding arguments that the ellipsis sites of comparatives
are projected in syntax. In a clausal comparative the site of Comparative Deletion is
reconstructed at LF, where its copy of a name counts as a pronoun, so that coreference is out in
(24) and restored in (25), whose site sits in a further clause; neither Kennedy's semantic
resolution nor reconstruction of the name as an R-expression predicts both. A phrasal comparative
is a Gapped clause, a copy of the matrix clause with the remnant in the position of its
correlate, and the remnant inherits the correlate's c-command relations (Prediction V). Lechner's
minimal pairs vary the height of the correlate against a coindexed matrix term, and the Gapped
clause separates the halves of each pair, while Heim's direct analysis, which raises the remnant
out of the clause, gives both halves one verdict.

## Main definitions

* `Lechner2004.Resolution`: the resolution of a deletion site, semantic, syntactic, or syntactic
  under Fiengo and May's vehicle change.
* `Lechner2004.PhrasalComparative.gapped`, `Lechner2004.PhrasalComparative.direct`: the Gapped
  clause and the LF of the direct analysis.

## Main results

* `Lechner2004.resolution_fits_iff`: only reconstruction under vehicle change predicts (24)–(25).
* `Lechner2004.PhrasalComparative.gapped_cCommands_iff`,
  `Lechner2004.PhrasalComparative.cCommands_gapped_iff`: Prediction V.
* `Lechner2004.analysis_fits_iff`, `Lechner2004.direct_same`: only the Gapped clause predicts the
  minimal pairs (83)–(91).

## Implementation notes

Trees carry categories only, and German clauses have their underlying hierarchy, subject over
dative over accusative. Binding is computed within the Gapped clause, which coordinates with the
matrix clause outside the c-command domain of its terms. Heim's LF, in which *-er* takes the
correlate and the remnant as a pair ((55), (88)), is rendered by adjoining both to the clause,
the configuration in which Lechner reads c-command off (88) and (92)–(93); its base-position
reading is computed on the surface tree. The ?? of (91) counts against coreference. The book
calls the effect in (24) a Principle C violation, but with the copy a pronoun, as (25) shows it
to be, (24) violates Condition B.

## TODO

Prediction IV ((75)–(77)), Predictions I–III of §3.1, the arguments from reflexives and the
Coordinate Structure Constraint of chapter 2, §§2.2–2.3, and the argument of (27)–(29) against a
surface Principle B account of (24) are not formalized.
