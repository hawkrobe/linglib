# Charlow (2020): the scope of alternatives

Charlow takes an indefinite to denote a set of individuals and lets it take scope through two
type-shifters: `η` forms a singleton, and `≫=` feeds the members of a set one by one to a scope
and unions the results. They are the unit and bind of the set monad. Because bind is associative,
an indefinite that takes scope at the edge of an island turns the island into a set of
alternatives, and the island can then take scope in its turn, which gives exceptional scope
without movement out of the island. Higher-order alternative sets let two indefinites on one
island take scope independently, and once assignments are added to the monad, an indefinite whose
restrictor holds a bound pronoun cannot outscope the pronoun's binder.

## Main definitions

* `closureCond`, `det`, `distr`: the conditional (31), the determiners (65) and (84), and the
  distributivity operator (41), each closing off the alternatives of its scope.
* `lawyerOuter`, `relativeOuter`: the two higher-order islands of Figure 10.
* `Si.pro`, `Si.beta`, `Si.det`: pronouns (58), `β`-binding (61) and determiners over
  `ReaderT (Assignment E) Set`.
* `Si.a`, `Si.that`: the indefinite determiner (83) and the relative pronoun (87).
* `Si.abstractChoice`: abstraction by a choice function in alternative semantics (74).

## Main results

* `some_pure`, `bind_pure_left`, `plusWh_some`: the extended Partee triangle of Figure 4
  commutes.
* `exceptional_scope`, `exceptional_ne_narrow`: (33), and the exceptional reading of (1) is not
  the narrow one.
* `every_island`: pied-piping a universal's island gives nothing new (2).
* `intermediate_scope`, `two_island`: intermediate exceptional scope (3), and the distributive
  scope of a plural indefinite stays in its island (39).
* `relative_wide`, `lawyer_wide`, `seminar_paper`: selective exceptional scope, (43), (47), (49).
* `lawyer_wide_not_pointwise`: no function of the point-wise island meaning gives the
  lawyer-wide reading of (43).
* `Si.expert_wide_bound`: exceptional scope beside a bound pronoun (51).
* `Si.paper_wide`, `Si.paper_narrow`, `Si.not_dependsOn_paper_wide`: the Binder Roof
  Constraint of (53), Figure 14.
* `Si.cf_reading_iff`, `Si.cf_reading_not_imp_bound`: the choice-function reading (69) and its
  over-generation.
* `Si.a_paper_that_she_wrote`: the determiners of Appendix A derive (66).
* `Si.nobody_met_iff`: abstraction by a choice function over-generates (77).

## Implementation notes

* `η`, `≫=` and flattening are `pure`, `>>=` and `joinM` of mathlib's `Set.monad`, and the
  closure `⇓` (19) is `sSup` on `Set Prop`. Truth values are `Prop`, as in the paper's main text.
* The paper's conditional `if : t → t → t` is a parameter `cond`; the witnesses that separate
  readings use the material conditional. Pluralities are `Finset`s of atoms.
* A derivation is a term in the monad, and which constituent takes scope where is not
  represented, so a reading the paper rules out is shown to differ from the derived ones.
* `Si.cf_reading_iff` assumes that no two candidates wrote the same papers, which the paper's
  gloss of (69) needs and leaves implicit.
* Figure 9 prints `die X` for `die x`.

## TODO

* (46), and point-wise composition with a closure inside the island (45) on (46) and (47).
* (79)–(82), (88), and Appendix B.
