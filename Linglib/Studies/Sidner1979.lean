# Sidner (1979): Towards a Computational Theory of Definite Anaphora Comprehension

This file formalizes the focusing theory of [sidner-1979], whose chapters on the discourse
focus and on pronouns are reprinted as [sidner-1983]. A discourse has a discourse focus and an
actor focus, each with an ordered list of alternates and a stack of rejected foci. The expected
focus algorithm predicts the discourse focus from the first sentence: the subject of an is-a or
there-insertion sentence, otherwise the first member of the default expected focus list, the
phrases ordered theme first, then the other thematic positions with the agent last, then the
verb phrase (`Sentence.expectedFocus`, `Sentence.expectedFocus_le`). The focusing algorithm
confirms or rejects the current focus by the anaphora of each later sentence, retaining it
when an anaphor co-specifies it and otherwise moving it to a co-specified alternate or stack
member and stacking the rejected focus (`State.confirm`, `State.step`); the actor focus is the
agent of the current sentence (`State.updateActor`). A pronoun is interpreted against the
state: the discourse focus is preferred for a pronoun outside agent position and the actor
focus for one in agent position, the alternates following, except that a discourse focus
established in an earlier sentence than the actor focus takes precedence even in agent position
(`State.candidates`, `State.cospecify`, `State.cospecify_agent_of_precedence`). The examples
run through the pipeline: the three sentences illustrating the expected focus algorithm, the
recency rule in D2, the confirmation in D25 and the movement in D35, the reversed
co-specifications of D14, and D9, in which every *he* co-specifies Jeff while the actor focus
moves from the speaker to Carl to Oscar (`D9.he_jeff`).

## Implementation notes

* A sentence is its form, which names the subject of an is-a or there-insertion sentence, and
  its phrases in surface order, each with the entity it specifies (for a pronoun its
  co-specification), its thematic relation at the granularity of the default expected focus
  list, whether it is a pronoun, and whether it is animate; agent position is the agent
  relation, and the verb phrase is a phrase with the relation `verbPhrase`, which the examples
  omit.
* The pipeline processes interpreted sentences: the focusing algorithm consults the
  co-specifications of the anaphora, and the pronoun rules order the candidates from which a
  predicate standing for the syntactic anaphoric filters and the inference mechanism selects
  the first. Anaphora in agent position are not consulted by the focusing algorithm when
  others occur.
* Only pronominal anaphora are modelled, so the steps of the focusing algorithm on
  do-anaphora, focus sets, implicit specification and nominalization are omitted, and the
  clause of step 3 on a definite noun phrase mentioning the focus is vacuous. A focus moved to
  a stack member stacks the rejected focus above the remaining members. Possessives, plural
  pronouns and the potential actor ambiguity condition are outside the model.
