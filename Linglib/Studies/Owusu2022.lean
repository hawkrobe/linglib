# Owusu (2022): the Akan indefinite *bí*

Owusu analyses the Akan indefinite *bí* as a choice function skolemized to a situation. Her
entry (67) maps a situation `s` and a property `P` to `f s (P s)`, presupposing that `f s` is a
choice function. The function is free, fixed by the context as in Kratzer's analysis of *a
certain*, and never existentially closed. A *bí* phrase scopes only above negation and, as a
subject, above *biara* 'every', but as an object it also scopes below *biara*, while a bare noun
scopes only below either. Owusu argues that closing the function freely, after Reinhart and
Winter, derives the narrow reading under negation that *bí* lacks; that closing it only at the
top, after Matthewson, derives no narrow reading of a conditional; and that the reading below
*biara* is functional, the function's individual index being bound by the quantifier.

## Main results

* `closure_below_negation_iff`: closing the function below negation, (50), gives the narrow
  reading.
* `negation_narrow_iff`: under negation the free function of (67) gives the narrow reading for
  every predicate only when the restrictor has a single member.
* `closure_above_conditional_iff`: closing the function at the top of a conditional gives the
  wide reading.
* `wide_iff`, `functional_iff`: (55), the readings with the individual index free and bound.
* `ex57_free_iff`, `ex57_bound_iff`, `Scenario58.free`, `Scenario58.bound`,
  `Scenario58.not_narrow`: both construals of (57) say that every student kept back one of
  their papers, which holds in the scenario (58) where the narrow reading fails.
* `bi_not_narrow_under_negation`, `bare_narrow_under_negation`, `bi_narrow_under_every_iff`,
  `bare_narrow_under_every`: the chapter's generalizations over its examples.

## Implementation notes

* The presupposition of (67) is the type of `f`, a family `S → ChoiceFunction E`.
* The situation index and the individual index of (67) are taken one at a time, as the index
  type `S`.
* A construal holds in some context when some choice function makes it true.
* An example counts as a *bí* example when one of its words is the form of
  `Akan.Determiners.bi`.
* Owusu takes the world variable from a 2019 manuscript by Mirrazi; [mirrazi-2024] develops
  the analysis from the same example.

## TODO

* The weak crossover asymmetry of (54)–(56), after [chierchia-2001]: an index bound by
  *biara* in subject position would cross over it. It needs binding over syntax trees.
* The world variable of §3.3.3 in conditionals, (66), and under *pɛ* 'want', (65), with the
  existential entailment and substitution diagnostics of §3.2.3. The bound construal of (66b)
  is entailed by the narrow reading but is weaker than it unless the function picks an elder who
  comes wherever one does; the chapter does not discuss this.
* §3.4: *bí nó*, *nó bí*, and the ignorance inference of *bí*.
* The second chapter's analysis of *nó*.
