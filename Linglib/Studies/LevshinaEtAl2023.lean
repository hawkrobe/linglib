# Levshina et al. (2023): Why We Need a Gradient Approach to Word Order

This file formalizes the corpus illustrations of [levshina-etal-2023]'s case for describing
word order by continuous measures rather than categorical labels. The paper's two measures of a
binary order are the proportion of one order and the Shannon entropy of the order in bits; the
entropy is the entropy of the Bernoulli law of the order at that proportion
(`orderEntropy_eq_binEntropy`), so it is `0` when one order is fixed and `1` at an even split,
the worked values of section 4.1.1, and among languages that put the subject first more often
than not it ranks languages in reverse of the proportion (`orderEntropy_lt_iff`). In the 31
news corpora of Figure 1 the subject precedes the object in most clauses of every language
(`subject_usually_first`). Figure 3 plots the mutual information between case marking and
syntactic role against order entropy for 30 corpora: the two covary positively over the sample
(`covariance_entropy_caseInformation_pos`), the corpus of maximal entropy, Lithuanian, has the
most informative case marking (`freest_most_case_informative`), and the corpus of minimal
entropy has none (`most_rigid_least_case_informative`). The Russian register study of section
4.1.3 is the population of its 300 annotated clauses under the uniform measure: verb–object
order is less probable in conversation than in fiction (`conversation_lt_fiction`) and equally
probable in fiction and news (`fiction_eq_news`).

## Implementation notes

* The rows are the paper's OSF datasets, generated into `Data.WordOrder.Corpus.LevshinaEtAl2023`.
  The entropies of Figure 3 are the dataset's printed values from the paper's own extraction,
  not recomputed from the counts of Figure 1, which come from a different sample of the same
  corpora.
* The claim of Figure 1 that the proportions form a continuum with no natural cut-off is a
  visual one without a statistic and is not stated as a theorem; nor is the logistic regression
  of section 4.1.3, whose descriptive content is the conditional probabilities.
