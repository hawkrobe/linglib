# Purver and Ginzburg (2004): Clarifying Noun Phrase Semantics

A reprise question repeats a phrase of the previous utterance to query it, as *Turkey?* does
after *We'll get the turkey out of the oven*. Purver and Ginzburg read what a noun phrase
denotes off the readings its reprises have. In the grammar of Ginzburg and Cooper a sign lists
its contextual parameters, the objects a hearer must identify in context, and a reprise can
query only these. The Reprise Content Hypothesis says that a reprise queries part of the content
of the reprised phrase, and in its strong version exactly that content. The paper takes a
quantified noun phrase to denote a witness set, a subset of the noun's extension that its
quantifier holds of, and its Definiteness Principle makes that content a contextual parameter
in a definite use and a member of the store of existentially quantified objects in an
indefinite one.

## Main statements

* `rows_predicted`: every corpus reading the paper judges possible queries a contextual
  parameter of the sign for that use of a noun phrase, and no reading it marks impossible does.
* `strong_np`, `not_strong_gq`: a definite noun phrase that denotes a witness set holds the
  strong hypothesis, and one that denotes a generalized quantifier never does, although both
  make the same parameters available.
* `Sign.strong_word_iff`: a word holds the strong hypothesis exactly when it stores none of its
  content.
* `pair_apply_iff`: a quantifier holds of a predicate exactly when some witness set lies inside
  the predicate and the rest of the noun's extension lies outside it, which is the paper's
  reading of a monotone decreasing noun phrase as a reference set with its complement.

## Implementation notes

* A sign records which kinds of object it contributes, not their values, since the argument
  turns on what kind of object a reprise queries. A content is the set of its components, so
  that both members of a reference set and complement pair can be abstracted.
* `Sign.phrase` takes the parameters that the Definiteness Principle distributes as an optional
  argument, by default the content. It is set for attributive definites, where the paper asks
  for "a slightly different version" of the principle, and for the generalized-quantifier
  alternative.
* The rows carry the paper's classification of each use as a feature, and a referential use of
  an indefinite or a universal counts as definite, as in the paper. Every noun phrase gets the
  sign of a determiner with a noun, pronouns and bare *wh*-words included. Marginal readings
  make no claim.
* Quantifier scope, anaphora, the retrieval of stored objects and the corpus counts are not
  formalized.
