# Kleene's three-valued logic as the consistent fragment of Belnap's FOUR
[fitting-1994]

[fitting-1994] ("Kleene's Three Valued Logics and Their Children") organizes
Kleene's logics as fragments of [belnap-1977]'s four-valued bilattice `FOUR`,
sliced by the *conflation* `−` (the knowledge-order involution): the strong
Kleene values are exactly those `x` with `x ≤_k −x` — the *consistent*
(non-glut) values.

`FOUR` and its two orders / negation / conflation are the shared substrate in
`Core.Logic.Bilattice`. Here we prove the slicing for linglib's `Truth3`
(Kleene's three-valued logic, [kleene-1952]): `ofTruth3` embeds `Truth3` onto the
consistent fragment of `FOUR`, matching the truth order (`Truth3`'s `≤` vs
`FOUR`'s `≤`), the knowledge order (`Truth3.toFlat`, i.e. `Flat Bool`, vs
`FOUR`'s `≤ₖ`), and negation. So the gap logic linglib uses for presupposition
is the `I`-free slice; the glut `I` is what trivalence excludes. The bilattice
route to natural-language entailment, implicature, and presupposition is
[schoter-1996] (see `Studies.Schoter1996`).

## Main results

* `Fitting1994.ofTruth3` — the embedding `Truth3 → FOUR`
* `Fitting1994.ofTruth3_consistent`, `consistent_range` — its image is exactly
  the consistent fragment
* `le_ofTruth3`, `kLE_ofTruth3`, `neg_ofTruth3`, `inf_ofTruth3`/`sup_ofTruth3`
  — `Truth3` is the consistent fragment of `FOUR` as a bilattice *logic*: both
  orders, negation, and the strong-Kleene connectives `∧`/`∨` as restrictions
  of `FOUR`'s truth meet/join
