# Steinert-Threlkeld, Imel and Guo (2023): A semantic universal for modality

This file formalizes the Independence of Force and Flavor universal of
[steinert-threlkeld-imel-guo-2023], the substrate's `Modality.ForceFlavorIndependent`,
against the Single Axis of Variability universal of [nauze-2008] it replaces. The Washo verb
*-eʔ* of [bochnak-2015a] varies on both axes yet is a product, the hypothetical *mighst* is
neither, and the singleton meanings of Paciran Javanese ([vander-klok-2013a]) satisfy the
universal trivially. The paper's equivalence of independence with convexity for the grid
betweenness of [chemla-buccola-dautriche-2019] is the substrate's
`forceFlavorIndependent_iff_pair_product_subset`.

The paper offers path-connectedness as a weaker fallback universal, defined by replacing the
"and" of independence with an "or" and glossed in a footnote as any two points being joined by a
path. The two readings come apart. Read as a path through the rook's graph on the force-flavor
grid, whose edges change one coordinate, the property follows from the "or" formulation
(`PathConnected.connected`), but the second modal of Table 1, given as satisfying
path-connectedness without independence, is connected in the grid and fails the "or"
formulation: its weak teleological and strong epistemic points share no corner
(`table1b_connected_not_pathConnected`).

The Koryak attitude verb *ivək* is the paper's other counterexample to Nauze's universal, with
the doxastic and assertive flavors of [mocnik-abramovitz-2019] on the flavor axis. Section 4.1
reads them as reporting all four combinations of the two forces and the two flavors, which is
what their lexical entry predicts (`ivek_forceFlavorIndependent`). Their footnote 10, however,
could not confirm an existential 'say', and without it the attested uses are not a product;
they satisfy only path-connectedness (`ivek_attested`).

## Implementation notes

The paper's space has two forces, weak and strong, and the flavors epistemic, deontic and
teleological; the library folds teleological into circumstantial. The doxastic and assertive
flavors of *ivək* lie outside that space, and the universal is stated for any types of forces
and flavors.
