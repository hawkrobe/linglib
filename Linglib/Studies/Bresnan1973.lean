# Bresnan (1973): Syntax of the comparative clause construction in English

Every English comparative is built on a quantifier phrase, a Det of *as*, *too*, *that*, *so*,
*-er* or *-est* over a Q drawn from *much*, *many*, *little*, *few* and *enough*, so that *more*
is *-er much* or *-er many* and *taller* derives from *[[much-er] tall]* ([bresnan-1973]). Three
ordered rules derive the head: *-er* Encliticizing moves the clitic onto Q and leaves the Det
empty; Much Deletion then removes an unprotected *much* directly before the adjective of its
AP, so *as much tall* becomes *as tall* while *much-er tall* survives to become *taller*; and
QP Raising, on the empty Det alone, feeds AP Shift, *a more reliable man* beside *too reliable
a man* and *\*a too reliable man*. The clause is related to the head by Comparative Formation:
every *than* and *as* phrase is a full clause from which a constituent nondistinct from the
head, a QP, an AP or an NP, is deleted, the remainder positioned to the head's right. The four
puzzles of the introduction turn on the identity of the head and of the deleted constituent:
whether the clause predicates *a man* of the standard (A), whether the clause has a partitive
to match a partitive head (B), whether the QP is AP-internal so that the synthetic form can
arise (C), and whether the identity of a Q with a definite measure phrase is consistent with
the privative adjective it modifies (D).

## Implementation notes

Each row carries the paper's analysis of its example as features, the Det and Q of the QP
and its position, or the head's category and site and the constituent the clause supplies;
acceptability is derived from the rules. The anomaly of (242d) is read off the lexical gender
of *mother* and *man* in the English fragment, privativeness off the polarity of *short*. QP
recursion and QP Shift (1.4), *so* and *such* (1.5), *of* Insertion, Enough Permutation and
the ambiguities of 1.8 beyond the homophony of *more* are not formalized.
