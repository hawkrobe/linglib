# Klinedinst and Rothschild (2012): Connectives without Truth Tables

This file formalizes [klinedinst-rothschild-2012]'s parameter treatment of the dynamic effects
of *and* and *or*. Truth is relative to a world and to an information parameter, the set of
worlds that epistemic modals quantify over, (46) and (47), the domain semantics of
[yalcin-2007] (`Yalcin2007.Sentence`), and the connectives shift that parameter for their
second clause: *a and b* evaluates *b* against the parameter updated with *a*, (49), and
*a or b* against the parameter updated with the negation of *a*, (50) (`conj`, `disj`). This
is what lets an epistemic modal sit in a disjunct: *the dog is in the backyard or it must be
in the kitchen*, (36), says that the dog is in the backyard or that the information, given
that it is not, puts it in the kitchen (`disj_must_iff`), disjunctive syllogism fails for it,
(38)–(40) (`not_disjunctive_syllogism`), and so does commutation, (104) (`disj_not_comm`).
The non-truth-tabular uses of §1 are the assertion forms of (60) that keep only the dynamic
effect: *and* with its first clause shifting the parameter alone is the conditional of (52),
(61) and (62), and *or* with both clauses entailed asserts its first disjunct and the second
under the negation of the first, (66) and (67) (`Use.interpret`); the other two forms collapse
into the normal connectives (`doubleEntailment_and`, `shift_disj`). A normal conjunction whose
second conjunct needs worlds where the first fails is a contradiction, (68)
(`not_conj_might_neg`).

## Implementation notes

* The context parameter and the presuppositional definedness of (48) are omitted, as is the
  inner and outer sphere refinement of §4.2 for counterfactual morphology; a sentence is a
  function of the information parameter and the world.

/-- (36): *the dog is in the backyard or it must be in the kitchen* is a disjunction of the
first disjunct with the report that the information, given that the dog is not in the
backyard, puts it in the kitchen. -/
theorem disj_must_iff (p q : Set W) (s : Set W) (w : W) :
    disj (Sentence.ofProp p) (Sentence.ofProp q).must s w ↔
      w ∈ p ∨ ∀ w' ∈ s, w' ∉ p → w' ∈ q := by
  simp [disj, Sentence.must, Sentence.ofProp, update, Sentence.neg]

/-- Disjunctive syllogism holds for factual disjuncts. -/
theorem disjunctive_syllogism (p q : Set W) :

  intro s w h
  rcases h _ List.mem_cons_self with hp | hq
  · exact hp
  · exact absurd hq (h _ (List.mem_cons_of_mem _ List.mem_cons_self))

/-- (38)–(40): disjunctive syllogism fails with the modal disjunct. On the two-world model,
the dog inside in one world and outside in the other, the disjunction *the dog is inside or it
must be outside* and *it's not the case that it must be outside* both hold at the outside
world, where the dog is not inside. -/

/-- (104): the dynamic effect is asymmetric, so the disjuncts do not commute: with the modal
disjunct first, the same model falsifies the disjunction. -/
