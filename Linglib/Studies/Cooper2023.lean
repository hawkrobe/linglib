# Cooper (2023): From Perception to Communication: A Theory of Types for Action and Meaning

Cooper's theory of types with records reads a type as true when something witnesses it. A
modal type system assigns objects to types in each of a family of possibilities, and subtyping is
inclusion of witnesses in every possibility, so an attitude, which matches its complement against
a type of the agent's information state, depends on which postulates restrict the possibilities.
A witness for a quantified sentence is a witness set with a function into or out of it, following
Barwise and Cooper's two procedures for monotone quantifiers, and the sets a witness carries are
the anaphora sets the noun phrase makes available. Scope ambiguity comes from storing a
quantifier in the context and retrieving it over the sentence, and binding from marking pronouns
as local or reflexive.

## Main statements

* `Venus.not_believe_oneStar`, `Venus.believe_oneStar_reporter`: the ancients do not believe
  that Hesperus is Phosphorus under their own postulates, and do under the reporter's.
* `nonempty_generalWCIncr_iff_toGQ`, `nonempty_generalWCDecr_iff_toGQ`: the general witness
  conditions are Barwise and Cooper's two procedures for the tree quantifier of their relation.
* `le_uniformOn_iff`: a probabilistic witness condition of §7.3 is its cardinal one.
* `WitnessCondition.exists_set_subset`: each witness condition can be met by a witness whose
  set lies in the anaphora set it makes available, which `anaphora_rows` checks against the
  book's judgements.

## Implementation notes

* Within one possibility, types are Lean's own, and a property is `E → Type`. A modal type
  system assigns shared objects to types, so subtyping, and every attitude built on it,
  compares witnesses across possibilities. The postulates for transitive verbs are hypotheses
  on Lean types.
* A negated type `¬T` (Ch. 7, (69)) is the function type `T → Empty`.
* Proportional thresholds are cross-multiplied `n / d` over a nonempty extension, and the
  thresholds `θ_q(P)` are parameters, shared by *few* and *a few* only where stated.
* Context labels are chosen distinct by hand rather than incremented at combination, and a
  stored quantifier keeps its foreground, its background merged at storage.

## TODO

* The closure of a content type under the operations (Ch. 8, (21), (89)) and the combination
  of content types (23)–(24) are not modelled: each reading is derived by composing the
  operations by hand.
* The asymmetric merge `∧̣` of a type with a point of view (Ch. 6, (55)–(58)) is not defined:
  an information state lists which types are such merges.
* The number of a pronoun is not modelled, so the contrast between *it* and *they* with a
  universal antecedent, (46b)–(46e), is recorded in the rows but not derived.
* A reflexive inside a verb phrase (*The guru revealed Kim to himself*) and picture noun
  phrases are outside the treatment, as in the book.
* Purification is determiner-independent, so both donkey readings are predicted for every
  determiner; the experimental record of [denic-sudo-2022] on non-monotonic determiners and
  the question-based selection of [champollion-bumford-henderson-2019] are the tests to
  state.

/-! ## Modality and intensionality without possible worlds (Ch. 6)

A modal type system (§1.4.3.5, (54); §6.3) is a family of possibilities sharing their types
but differing in which objects witness them. Equivalence, subtyping, necessity and
possibility are defined over all possibilities, (1), or over those in which the types occur,
(2), whose proof rules (4) settle the inclusive notions. Necessity and possibility in language
are relativised, as in Kratzer's semantics, to a background type and a topos, a dependent type
from situations to types standing in for the accessibility relation, (20)–(24).
Intensionality replaces sets of worlds by types (§6.5): an attitude holds when the type of
the agent's long-term memory, religious beliefs or desires is, up to relabelling, a subtype
of its complement in the modal system, directly or through a point of view, (39)–(92). -/

/-! ### Intensionality (§6.5)

Subtyping is modal (§1.4.3.5; Ch. 1, (55)): `T₁ ⊑ T₂` when, in every possibility, whatever is of
`T₁` is of `T₂`, whether because the type system requires it, as a record type with more
fields is a subtype of one with fewer (structural subtyping, (50a)), or because a postulate
restricts attention to the possibilities where it holds, as `sell(a, b, c) ⊑ buy(c, b, a)`
(postulated subtyping, (50b)). An attitude matches its complement against a type of the
agent's information state, up to relabelling (39)–(41), so which postulates the modal system
carries, the agent's or the reporter's, decides the report (pp. 261–262). -/

named Phosphorus rising in the morning (52); on learning that they are one body, it gains the
field identifying them (53). Records are reduced to the bodies in their two `x`-fields. Under

/-! ## Witness-based quantification (Ch. 7)

A property may be restricted by conditions in its domain beyond the required `x`-field,
(7b), and purification lowers the restriction into the body existentially, `𝔓` (12), or
universally, `𝔓∀` (13). The cardinality conditions on witness sets (20)–(35) have
frequentist probabilistic forms (41)–(58), estimable from an agent's experience base of
remembered judgements (37)–(39). The particular witness conditions for `exist` (63) and
`no` (70) are types equivalent to the general ones (59) whose witnesses carry what discourse
anaphora picks up. -/

/-! ### Types of witness sets (§7.2.4)

A witness set `X` of type `qʷ(P)` meets two conditions, (20)–(35): it is a subset of the
property extension `[↓P]`, which (20a) makes the link to the witness sets of
[barwise-cooper-1981], and its cardinality stands in a relation fixed by `q` to that of
`[↓P]`. Read on van Benthem's tree of numbers, whose perspective on determiners as relations
Cooper adopts (p. 298), the relation is a quantifier, and a witness set of `qʷ(P)` is a witness
set in the sense of [barwise-cooper-1981] for it (`witnessType_iff_witness`). -/

/-! ### Witness conditions for quantificational ptypes (§7.4)

The general witness conditions (59) are the two procedures of [barwise-cooper-1981] for
monotone quantifiers (p. 298): for an increasing quantifier (59a), a witness set of `qʷ(P)`
and a function from its members into the scope; for a decreasing one (59b), a witness set and
a function into it from the objects with both properties. The restrictor enters only through
the witness-set type. By Barwise and Cooper's C11 each is witnessed exactly when the tree
quantifier of `qʷ`'s relation holds of `P` and `Q`, provided the relation is closed upwards,
respectively downwards, in `|X|`; `every` is not, and has its own truth condition. -/

the first property and not the second. MAXSET is the path `s.restr` of the content records
(102), (107), (112), named in (103a), (108a) and (113a). The others come from the set a witness
carries. The individual of the particular condition for `exist` and the witness set of (59a)
lie in REFSET, the witness set of a condition with negated scope, for `no` and for `few`, in
COMPSET, and a witness of (59b) can be traded for one whose witness set is REFSET
(`WitnessCondition.exists_set_subset`). -/

/-! ## Type-based underspecification (Ch. 8)

The content of an utterance is raised to a type of contents, the readings being the closure
of the compositional content under the operations of this section. Storage puts a
parametric quantifier into the context's store, leaving in its place the content of a label's
value (17), and retrieval quantifies the stored quantifier back in over the content as a
property of that value (19). Anaphoric combination identifies a pronoun's label with an
antecedent's (28) unless the pronoun is marked local, the marking cleared at the sentence
boundary (77); reflexives are marked (83), bound by reflexivisation (84) and required to be
bound at the verb phrase (85)–(88). Donkey anaphora goes through localisation (49), which
folds the context into the property's domain so that the indefinite's witness in the
restrictor can be aligned with the pronoun (51)–(52); `𝔓` then gives the weak reading
(55)–(59) and `𝔓∀` the strong one (60)–(66), quantifying over farmers and not farmer–donkey
pairs. -/
