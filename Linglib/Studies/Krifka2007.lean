# Krifka (2007): Approximate interpretation of number words

Round number words invite approximate interpretations, *one hundred meters* against *103 meters*.
Krifka derives this without a general bias for approximation. His earlier bidirectional account
paired a preference for simple expressions with one for approximate interpretations; this paper
keeps truthfulness strict and lets expression economy apply only where there is a choice, which
there is only under an approximate reading. A hearer then reasons strategically: a non-shortest
expression signals a precise reading, and a short one is read approximately because the
approximate reading covers more equally likely values. Where number words name points on scales
of different granularity, the same reasoning picks the coarsest salient scale the reported value
lies on, and halving a scale's width is the optimal refinement, adding exactly the values the
coarser scale distorts most.

## Main results

* `division_of_labour`: on the earlier account the superoptimal pairs are the simple expression
  read approximately and the complex one read precisely.
* `winners_of_true_value`: with truthfulness above conditional expression economy, a true value
  of 39 is reported as *forty* approximately or *thirty-nine* precisely, and 40 as *forty* on
  either reading.
* `approximate_more_probable`: on the uniform prior the approximate reading of *forty* covers
  nine times the mass of the precise one, the hearer's conservative choice.
* `coarsest_scale_most_probable`: given a reported value, the most probable aligned scale is the
  coarsest one through it, reading *forty-five minutes* at the quarter hours and *forty* at the
  five minutes.

## Implementation notes

* Approximate readings are intervals, the halo `[i - s, i + s]`, the paper's own simplification
  of its normal distributions; indistinguishability at approximation level 1/10 compares means
  within one standard deviation.
* The hearer's comparisons are stated on the joint measure over scale and value at the report
  events, since the posteriors over scales given one report share a normalizer.
* Each scale is credited with its full cell: the quarter-hour cell around 45 holds fifteen
  minutes where the paper prints `10r`, and the approximate mass of *forty* on the uniform prior
  is `9/100` where the paper prints 0.08; neither difference affects a comparison.
* Expression costs are a parameter, with the paper's cost comparisons as hypotheses; the
  paper's own syllable and occurrence counts are the rows of `Data/Experiments/Krifka2007.json`.
