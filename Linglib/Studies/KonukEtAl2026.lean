# Konuk, Quillien and Mascarenhas (2026): Plural Causes

Konuk, Quillien and Mascarenhas extend the Necessity–Sufficiency Model of Icard, Kominsky and
Knobe from single causes to plural ones, conjunctions of events judged as causes in their own
right. Counterfactual worlds are sampled urn by urn, each urn keeping its actual draw with
probability `s`, the stability, and otherwise redrawn from its prior; a cause's score weights its
sufficiency by its probability and its necessity by the probability of its absence, the
substrate's `CausalStrength.score` over plural causes.

Experiment 1 is a game won with two colored balls out of three urns, Experiment 2 one won with
(A ∧ B) ∨ (C ∧ D). Losses in Experiment 2 are scored against the classical negation of the rule or
its homogeneous negation, after the homogeneity of plural predication described by Križ and
Spector, on which each winning condition's plural predication is false.

## Main statements

* `score_twoOrMore_pair`: in a two-of-three threshold game a pair scores the probability that its
  urns agree; `intermediate_high_ranked_highest` and `low_high_outscores_low_intermediate_iff` give
  the pair rankings of Experiment 1 as functions of the stability.
* `mem_win_iff_barePlural`, `mem_homogeneousLoss_iff_barePlural`,
  `not_mem_homogeneousLoss_iff_indet`: a win is the truth of some condition's plural predication,
  the homogeneous loss the falsity of each, and the two losses differ where a predication falls in
  the homogeneity gap.
* `same_condition_pair_not_necessary`, `crossing_pair_necessary`, `partners_scored_alike`,
  `pair_scores_one`, `idle_urn_not_necessary`, `triple_positive_abnormal_inflation`: the winning
  rounds of Experiment 2.
* `classical_abnormal_deflation`, `homogeneous_abnormal_inflation`, `homogeneous_lt_iff`,
  `homogeneous_lt_of_ssubset`, `classical_triple_negative`, `homogeneousLoss_tripleNegative`: the
  losing rounds.

## Implementation notes

* Necessity holds the urns outside the plural at their actual draws, as in the worked example of
  p. 448, and the score weights by the plural's sampling probability, its prior at `s = 0`.
* `homogeneousLoss` negates each winning condition over its urns that are white in the actual
  round, which gives both of the paper's homogeneous losses, (2) and that of p. 468.
* Two of the paper's claims about the NSM fail in the model: `intermediate_high_ranked_highest`
  needs `0 < s`, and `partners_scored_alike` contradicts the abnormal deflation of p. 463.

## TODO

* The Counterfactual Effect Size Model of [quillien-lucas-2024], which p. 451 says ranks the
  intermediate and high pair highest at every stability.
* The `w`-weighted mixture of the two losses, a coin drawn in each counterfactual world
  (p. 465).
