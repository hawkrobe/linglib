# Partee (2010): Privative Adjectives: Subsective plus Coercion

Partee argues that no adjective is privative in Kamp's sense. A privative adjective is vacuous
within its literal head, so Kamp and Partee's non-vacuity principle shifts the head to include
the adjective's value, *fur* to real or fake fur, and on the shifted head *fake* is subsective;
the tautologous *real* needs the same shift. Nowak's Polish NP-splitting data motivate the move.
The adjectives that split are the intersective, subsective and privative ones, which form no
natural class of the traditional scale, while the modal ones do not, and once the privatives are
reanalysed the adjectives that split are exactly the subsective ones. *Former*, normally
privative, does not split, a puzzle Partee leaves open.

## Main statements

* `modal_no_split`, `nonmodal_split_except_former`: modal adjectives never split, and the others
  all split except *former*.
* `splittable_not_ordConnected`, `reanalyse_splittable_iff`: the classes that split are no
  interval of the traditional scale, and after the reanalysis they are exactly the subsective
  ones.
* `postulates_not_linear`: the meaning postulates do not order the subsective and privative
  classes.
* `real_isNonVacuous_iff`, `real_xor_fake`: *real* is vacuous on its literal head and non-vacuous
  on the head that a privative shifts, where everything is real or fake and not both.

## Implementation notes

The classes are the paper's labels for the meaning postulates, ordered by the traditional scale
that its footnote 1 says the postulates do not give, and a natural class is read as an interval
of that scale. Each Polish adjective's class is the paper's, recorded in the rows'
`paperFeatures`; for most adjectives of its lists the paper gives only the English. The shift is
`Semantics.Property.ShiftsHead`, and *real* is the identity modifier.
