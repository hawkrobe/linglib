# Heim (1983): On the Projection Problem for Presuppositions

This file formalizes [heim-1983]: a context admits a sentence when the sentence's context
change potential is defined on it, a sentence presupposes what every admitting context
entails (12), and the heritage properties that [karttunen-peters-1979] stipulate for *if*
and *not* are read off the potentials (14) and (15): a context admits "If A, B" iff it admits
A and its update by A admits B, and negation is a hole. The King example (1)–(3) is worked as
the paper does (`king_admits_iff`), the two ways of accommodating a presupposition under
negation are (16)'s global and local readings (`globalNeg_entails`, `localNeg_entails`), and
contexts as sets of sequence–world pairs (§3) carry the potentials for open sentences and
for *every* (21): under the novelty stipulation (22), "Every nation cherishes its king"
presupposes that every nation has a king (`every_nation_presupposes`), a presupposition in
the restrictor projects universally (23), and an indefinite's presupposition projects
universally unless it is accommodated in the course of the update (§3.3).

## Implementation notes

The propositional part (§2) uses the substrate's partial context change potentials over a
type of worlds: `ofPartialProp` for a sentence with a presupposition and an assertion,
`cond` for (14), `neg` for (15), and `admits` for definedness, so that the heritage
properties are the substrate's `admits_cond` and `admits_neg`. The file part (§3) uses the
same potentials over pairs of a sequence `ℕ → M` and a world, with `atom`, `atomP`, and
`every` stated here as (19)–(21) and entailment by a context read as inclusion. The paper
gives no potential for *no* (24), so that sentence is a row only.

A file whose membership depends only on the cards in `X` is, restricted to those cards, a
state of the substrate uniform at `X` (`File.toState`), and on such files the paper's
clauses are the file change potentials of [heim-1982] read on that stratum: the atom is the
merge with the atom's proposition state (`toState_atom`), negation by set difference is
non-subsistence (`neg_toState`), and (21) is rule (III) of the dissertation
(`toState_everyClause`). The novelty stipulation (22) is the file's independence of the
card (`novelIn_iff_determinedBy`).
