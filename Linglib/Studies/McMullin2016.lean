# McMullin (2016): Tier-Based Locality in Long-Distance Phonotactics

This file formalizes the argument of [mcmullin-2016] for the tier-based description of
long-distance phonotactics. A long-distance constraint can be stated over subsequences, a
forbidden pair of segments however far apart, the strictly piecewise description, or over
a tier projection, deleting transparent material and forbidding adjacent pairs, the
tier-based strictly local description; the thesis argues for the tier-based class, since
strictly piecewise grammars cannot see a blocker, an intervening segment that halts
harmony, deletion never turning a legal word illegal. Both halves are stated. Transparent
harmony, the Navajo sibilant harmony of [hansson-2010], is one stringset under either
description, as every agreement language is strictly piecewise of width two, equality being
transitive; opaque harmony with a blocker is tier-based strictly local of width two but
strictly piecewise at no width, since deleting the blocker leaves an illegal word and
strictly piecewise languages are closed under subsequence.

## Implementation notes

The blocking alphabet is schematic, one blocker, one transparent segment, and the two
harmonizing series, and stands in for no particular language; the attested opaque
consonant-harmony systems surveyed by Hansson are not formalized.

/-! ### Transparent harmony: Navajo is SP_2 as well as TSL_2 -/

/-- **Navajo sibilant harmony is strictly 2-piecewise.** The subject is the very
language `Studies/Hansson2010.lean` builds as TSL_2, not a parallel SP stipulation, so
the two classifications are of one stringset by construction. -/
theorem navajoSibilantHarmony_lang_isSP2 :
    navajoSibilantHarmony.language.IsStrictlyPiecewise 2 :=
  TierStrictlyLocalGrammar.agree_language_isStrictlyPiecewise Sibilant.onTier

/-- The tier-based and subsequence-based grammars for Navajo generate the same
language — the instance at `Sibilant.onTier` of `TierStrictlyLocalGrammar.agree_language_eq_sp`. -/

/-- [hansson-2010]'s minimal pair under the SP_2 description: the pre-harmony
/si-dʒéːʔ/ is rejected and the surface [ʃidʒéːʔ] accepted. Both transfer along the
equality of languages rather than being recomputed. -/

/-- Deleting the blocker leaves an illegal word — the configuration no subsequence
grammar can distinguish. -/

/-- **Blocking is not strictly piecewise, at any width** ([mcmullin-2016]). SP
languages are subsequence-closed, so a legal word whose blocker-deletion is illegal
rules out every SP grammar at once. -/

  λ h => unblocked_not_mem (h.mem_of_sublist (by decide) blocked_mem)

/-- **The tier buys expressive power** ([mcmullin-2016]): some TSL_2 language is
strictly piecewise at no width. With `navajoSibilantHarmony_lang_isSP2` — where the two
descriptions do coincide — this is the thesis's typological argument in miniature: SP
suffices for transparency, and only for transparency. -/
