# Martínez Vera (2026)

Martínez Vera analyzes the Saraguro Kichwa enclitic *=mi* as a focus marker. A sentence with
*=mi* and scope `p` presupposes an alternative to `p` that is highlighted in the context and that,
exhaustified relative to the alternatives, entails `¬p`; a proposition is highlighted when a move
on record addresses the question under discussion with it. A declarative with the direct
evidential *-rka* is an assertion and addresses that question by `p`, while one with the
reportative *-shka* presents `p` and addresses it by `p` or `¬p`, so only the latter can be
confirmed with *=mi*. In a correction the highlighted proposition is the corrected one, and
exhaustifying it relative to the alternatives of the constituent *=mi* marks yields `¬p`.

## Main definitions

* `withEvidential`: an evidential applied to a sentence.
* `Move.assert`, `Move.present`, `Move.declare`: the illocutionary operators, and the one a
  declarative with a given evidential performs.
* `Highlighted`, `MiDefined`: highlighting, and the presupposition of *=mi*.

## Main statements

* `miDefined_univ_iff`: for *=mi* on a clause exhaustification is vacuous, and *=mi* needs a
  highlighted proposition entailing `¬p`.
* `miDefined_update_present`, `miDefined_update_assert_iff`: presenting `p` licenses *=mi* on
  `p`, and asserting it does not.
* `miDefined_of_isInnocentlyExcludable`: corrections.
* `judgment_eq_acceptable_iff_miDefined`, `judgment_eq_acceptable_iff_nonempty`: an example is
  acceptable exactly when the analysis licenses its *=mi*, or its speaker stays consistent.

## Implementation notes

The paper's composition rule I is the bind of `TwoDim`, whose `⊤` plays the empty not-at-issue
layer. An illocutionary operator is the move it puts on record: its speaker's commitments,
without their addressee, and the propositions by which it addresses the question under
discussion, addressing being partial answerhood. Exhaustification is innocent exclusion; the
paper glosses the alternatives it may deny as those entailing the prejacent, under which a
correction would not entail `¬p`. Highlighting is the paper's notion, not the compositional
highlighting of `Semantics/Questions/Highlighting.lean`. The operator name `present` is
Faller's. The examples are evaluated in a model whose worlds are sets of events. The paper's
survey of *=mi* across Quechuan, after Faller, Sánchez, Tellings, Grzech and Bendezú, finds the
analyses hard to compare at present and is not formalized.

## TODO

* The paper describes *=mi* in (27d) as marking the verb; with alternatives varying the verb
  phrase, which include buying a pig, (37) would license it.
* Footnote 7's use of *-rka* by an authority without direct perception, and the past tense of
  *-rka* and *-shka*, are not modelled.

/-! ### The examples

The examples are evaluated in a model whose worlds are sets of events: an event fixes a value at
each constituent site of the scope sentence, a world is the set of events that happened, and the
question under discussion asks which event happened. The scope is that the scope event happened,
and a correction asserts that its variant at the contrasted site did. The propositions in play
are the scope, its negation and the variants, named by `Answer`; `miDefined_iff` reduces the
presupposition of *=mi* in each example's context to a check on these names, and
`judgment_eq_acceptable_iff_miDefined` compares it with the paper's judgments. -/
