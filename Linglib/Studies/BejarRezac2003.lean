# Béjar and Rezac 2003: person licensing and the Person Case Constraint

Béjar and Rezac derive the Person Case Constraint, that the direct object of two weak objects
cannot be 1st or 2nd person, from the Person Licensing Condition, that an interpretable 1st/2nd
person feature must enter an Agree relation with a functional category. A φ/Case head probes for
person and then for number, each search halting at the closest nominal and Agreeing with it only
if its Case is unvalued. A dative, whose Case its own preposition has valued, absorbs the person
probe and displaces, so the number probe reaches the theme and values its Case while the theme's
person goes unlicensed. Every repair adds a person probe: a theme above a prepositional dative, or
in a dative–nominative construction the projection of T, once the nominative's φ-features have
risen above the dative, as in French and Spanish but not in Icelandic.

## Main definitions

* `BejarRezac2003.Nominal`: a φ-goal with whether its person feature is licensed.
* `BejarRezac2003.Head`: a φ/Case head, with the Case it assigns, its EPP, and whether its
  nominative's φ-features rise as a head.
* `BejarRezac2003.Head.derive`: the derivation of a head's domain.
* `BejarRezac2003.PLC`: the Person Licensing Condition.

## Main results

* `BejarRezac2003.applicative_derive`: a dative is what its own preposition's derivation yields.
* `BejarRezac2003.doc_plc_iff`: the constraint in a double object construction.
* `BejarRezac2003.pp_plc`: the prepositional construction escapes it.
* `BejarRezac2003.dnc_plc_iff`: a dative–nominative construction obeys it iff the dative satisfies
  the EPP and the nominative's φ-features stay below it.

## Implementation notes

The number probe values Case after the projection's person probe has searched, where the paper
orders it before: valued Case would make the nominative inactive for that later search, which
(17) requires to reach it, and in every configuration of the paper the number probe finds the same
nominal either way. The displacement of the nominal that absorbs the person probe is taken as
given, so the crash of (4), where the dative cannot displace, is not modelled. The prose on p. 55
swaps the two constructions of (11); the diagram, which agrees with the low prepositional dative of
§2, is followed.

## TODO

The general form of the conclusion, that a nominal with unvalued Case is licensed iff it is the
closest match of the head's first or reprojected person probe, is stated only configuration by
configuration. Causatives and restructuring (2), nominalizations, and focused pronouns (§4) are not
modelled.
