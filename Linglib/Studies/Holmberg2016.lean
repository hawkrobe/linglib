# Holmberg (2016): The Syntax of Yes and No

This file formalizes [holmberg-2016]'s account of answers to yes–no questions. A polar
interrogative contains an unvalued polarity head whose two values yield the Hamblin set it
denotes, the same for a negative interrogative as for its positive counterpart
(`PolarInterrogative.denote_eq_polar_radical`), and an answer is a full sentence: a focused
valued polarity feature, spelled out by a particle or an echoed verb, merged with the clause
inherited from the question and eliding it, so that it chooses one of the two alternatives
(`smul_mem_alt`). The particles of
English, Swedish, French and Japanese spell out the features `english`, `swedish`, `french` and
`japanese`. The two systems for answering negative questions follow from the syntax of negation
(`AnswerFeature.answer`): a middle negation values the polarity head before the particle can,
so a plain affirmative clashes and the negative particle confirms the negative alternative,
while a low negation is out of reach, so *yes* confirms the negative alternative and *no* is a
double negation. English speakers who read *not* low and those who read it middle both take a
bare answer to *Is John not coming?* to mean that he is not coming (`negative_neutralization`);
an adverb preceding *not* forces the low reading, and in Swedish, which has no low negation, an
adverb screens the middle negation from the polarity head to the same effect
(`swedish_adverb`).

Section 4.4 defines the polarity-based system as the one lacking low negation (`PolarityBased`),
which is the typology's: its affirmative particle never confirms the negative alternative of a
negative question (`polarityBased_iff_not_confirmsNegativeQuestion`). Such a language has no
negative neutralization (`PolarityBased.answer_ne_negative`); Swedish, whose negation is never low,
is one (`swedish_polarityBased`), so confirming the positive alternative of a negative question
takes the polarity-reversing *jo* (`swedish_negative_question`), which a truth-based configuration
never needs (`no_reversal_needed_truth_based`). Crediting the REV feature to [farkas-bruce-2010],
the mechanism derives what they say *si* and *doch* mark: the answers a reversing feature gives are
their [reverse, +] answers (`responses_reversing_eq_reversePositive`). Positive-bias questions carry
a high negation outside the inherited clause and are answered like neutral questions
(`high_answers_like_neutral`). Which negations an English polar question form carries depends on the
speaker's variety (`negations`): a question with *not* has the inner reading for all speakers
(`primaryPolarity_of_mem_negations_nonPreposed`), and one with *-n't* only the outer reading in the
restrictive variety (`primaryPolarity_of_mem_negations_restrictive`), where it is answered like a
neutral question (`answer_of_mem_negations_restrictive`), and also the inner one in the tolerant
variety (`exists_mem_negations_tolerant_primaryPolarity`, `exists_mem_negations_tolerant`). The
mechanism predicts the judgment of every example answered by a single particle of the study, whose
question is neutral or whose negation the annotation locates (`judgment_iff_predicted`).

## Implementation notes

* An answer is computed as a polarity relative to the question's positive alternative
  (`AnswerFeature.answer`); the alternative it confirms is that polarity acting on the positive
  alternative. For *Har Johan nångång inte kommit i tid?* the positive alternative is that Johan
  has always been on time.
* Section 4.7 revises the height criterion: what matters is whether the negation can value the
  polarity head (`ClauseNegation.ValuesHead`), which is how Thai questions come out
  truth-based. Thai and the Chinese question types (Section 4.9) are not formalized, nor are
  verb-echo answers and the structure of Finnish and Thai answers (Chapter 3), the two versions
  of *no* of Section 4.4, the higher-order alternative of positive-bias questions (Section 4.8),
  the table of languages with a reversing affirmative particle, and the global survey of
  Section 4.2.
* The very formal English that does not use *-n't* at all, where a question with *not* must,
  as the book says presumably, carry the positive-bias reading as well, is not modelled: `negations`
  is stated for the varieties that use *-n't*.
* The book discusses French *oui* and *si* but not *non*, which `french` gives [−Pol], as the
  negative particle of every language the book discusses.
