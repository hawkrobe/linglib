# Seeliger & Repp (2018): Biased declarative questions in Swedish and German

[seeliger-repp-2018] distinguish two kinds of question with declarative syntax. A declarative
question such as *Peter is coming?* requires contextual evidence for the proposition the
declarative denotes and a speaker who had not assumed it; a rejecting question such as *Surely
Peter is coming?*, German *Peter kommt doch wohl?*, Swedish *Men Peter kommer väl?*, requires
evidence against it and a speaker who had assumed it. The profiles are stated in the
two-dimensional bias scheme of [sudo-2013], evidential and epistemic, which the paper extends with
'minus' values for epistemic bias (Section 2): the substrate's `Question.BiasValue`, a set of
states of evidence or belief, [+s] being `plus s` and [−s] its complement `minus s`.

Table 1's four types follow from the polarity of the declarative (`table1`): a declarative
question of polarity `s` has evidential bias [+s] and epistemic bias [−s] (`declarative`), and the
preliminary REJECTQ operator (17), λq: [¬q]^evid & [q]^epist. {q, ¬q}, gives a rejecting question
[+(¬s)] and [+s] (`rejectQ`). A rejecting question is therefore used in a proper subset of the
situations of the declarative question of the opposite polarity, the observation of p. 138
(`felicity_rejectQ_ssubset`). The revised operator (40), with the illocutionary modifier VERUM
or FALSUM, derives the positive rejecting question (`rejectQIM_verum`) but not the negative one:
FALSUM requires only that the evidence not support ¬p and that the speaker not have been
committed to p, which admits neutral evidence and no prior assumption, situations Table 1 excludes
(`felicity_rejectQ_ssubset_rejectQIM_falsum`).

Swedish marks a rejecting question with at least one morpho-syntactic cue (p. 157): a negative one
with fronted negation or *väl*, a positive one with *men* 'but' and *väl*, or with clause-initial
*visst* or *nog* when the evidence is direct. `SwedishCues.MarksRQ` states the generalization and
`marking_iff` checks it against the examples of Sections 3 and 5.3.

## Implementation notes

* The question REJECTQ forms from a declarative of polarity `s` with prejacent `p` is the polar
  question on `s • p`, which is the polar question on `p` (`Question.polar_smul`). The
  commitment-modified propositions IM(q) of (40) are not modelled, only the presuppositions.
* The declarative polarity is Table 1's simplified 'Declarative denotes' column: the paper argues
  in Section 6.1 that the negation of a negative rejecting question is FALSUM, not propositional
  negation.

## TODO

* The acceptability experiment of Section 5.4 (Table 2), the German rejections of Section 4.2
  that show *doch wohl* to be non-compositional, and the polarity-item diagnostics of Section 6.1
  are not yet encoded.
* The comparison with the monopolar declarative questions of [krifka-2015] (footnote 17), which
  predict the rows of declarative but not of rejecting questions.

FALSUM. -/
