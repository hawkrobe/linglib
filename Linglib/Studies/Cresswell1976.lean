# The semantics of degree

Cresswell's degree of comparison is a point paired with the ordering of its scale, and
*er than* holds of two degree properties when both are instantiated and every degree of the
first exceeds every degree of the second on their common scale, so a comparative across
scales is anomalous and a disjoined standard is compared universally. Mass nouns and plurals
carry degrees of volume and of number through the totality operator, degrees need no units
since any comparison relation yields a scale by quotienting, and the counterfactual *shorter
than he is* compares heights across worlds.

We take degrees on a family of scales to be mathlib's disjoint sum of the scales' orders and
prove the same-scale restriction, the universal reading of disjoined standards, the reduction
of the totality comparatives to volumes and cardinalities, the synonymy of *all* and *every*
given that there are men, the comparative on constructed degrees, and the counterfactual
through a Stalnaker selection function.

## Implementation notes

* The plural is read as in (49), a nonempty set of things satisfying the noun with its
  cardinality; as printed, (3.6) fixes the set to all of them, on which (54) would require
  the set of all men to walk.
