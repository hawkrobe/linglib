# Kadmon and Landman (1993): Any

Kadmon and Landman analyze *any CN* as the indefinite *a CN* with its domain widened along a
contextual dimension, licensed only when the widening makes the statement stronger, a condition
checked at the narrowest operator over the indefinite; free-choice *any* is the same item under a
generic interpretation. Widening weakens an existential, so strengthening holds exactly under an
antitone context, which is why Ladusaw's downward-entailing contexts license. Adversatives are
downward entailing on a constant perspective, a negated *because*-clause licenses only by
metalinguistic denial, and conditional antecedents strengthen once the implicit restriction is
fixed. The generic restriction is a vague property set whose precisifications give the normality
of GEN.

## Main results

* `de_satisfies_strengthening`, `ue_widening_weakens`, `ladusaw_de_is_kl_strengthening`: widening
  strengthens under an antitone context and weakens under a monotone one, so Ladusaw's contexts
  are strengthening contexts.
* `strengthening_sorryThat`, `not_strengthening_wants`: *sorry* licenses *any* and *glad* does
  not.
* `widening_satisfies_conditional_strengthening`: conditional antecedents strengthen.
* `rows_agree`: the paper's judgments follow its classification.
* `any_cn_dimensionally_universal`, `domain_vague_allows_exceptions`: widening makes *any CN*
  universal along its dimension, and domain vagueness lets a generic tolerate exceptions.
* `almost_rows`: *almost* modifies domain-precise and dimensionally universal noun phrases.
* `genericSubTrue_not_superTrue_iff_indet`: on a finite precisification space, exception tolerance
  is Fine's borderline status.

## Implementation notes

* The rows record, at the narrowest operator over *any*, a substrate `LicensingContext` where
  one exists and otherwise the local entailment signature; the settle-for-less and metalinguistic
  readings are the paper's own annotations, so `rows_agree` checks the paper's classification
  against its judgments rather than deriving those two readings.
* The vague-restriction apparatus is `Set`-based; the supervaluation substrate is `Finset`-based
  for computability, and `VagueRestriction.toSpecSpace` is the finite-case bridge.

/-! ### The strengthening condition

K&L's component (C): *any* is licensed only if widening creates a stronger
statement. For a context `C` and domains `D ⊆ D'`, the wide interpretation
must entail the narrow: `C (∃x∈D', Px) ⊆ C (∃x∈D, Px)`. This holds exactly
when `C` is antitone, which is why DE contexts license — and why widening in
UE contexts, where it weakens, leaves *any* unlicensed. -/

/-- The existential over a domain `D` is `∃ x ∈ D, P x`. -/
def existsInDomain {World Entity : Type*} (D : Set Entity) (P : Entity → Set World) :
    Set World :=
  fun w ↦ ∃ x ∈ D, P x w

/-- Widening the domain weakens the existential. -/
theorem existsInDomain_mono {World Entity : Type*} {D D' : Set Entity} (P : Entity → Set World)
    (h : D ⊆ D') : existsInDomain D P ⊆ existsInDomain D' P :=
  fun _ ⟨x, hx, hP⟩ ↦ ⟨x, h hx, hP⟩

/-- K&L's strengthening condition holds when widening the domain `D` to `D'` in context `C`
creates a stronger statement, the wide interpretation entailing the narrow one. -/
def Strengthening {World Entity : Type*} (C : Set World → Set World) (D D' : Set Entity)
    (P : Entity → Set World) : Prop :=
  C (existsInDomain D' P) ⊆ C (existsInDomain D P)

/-- In a DE (antitone) context, strengthening is automatic. K&L note that for many examples this
makes the same predictions as [ladusaw-1979], while explaining *why* DE contexts license, since
widening must strengthen and DE reverses entailment. -/

    (hD : D ⊆ D') : Strengthening C D D' P :=
  hDE (existsInDomain_mono P hD)

/-- In a UE (monotone) context, widening *weakens* — the opposite of
strengthening. This is K&L's explanation for why *any* is out in plain
positive contexts. -/

/-! ### Compatibility with Ladusaw 1979

Each context's licensing mechanism is read off its licenser (`PolarityItem.Licenser.mechanism`),
so this file's classification cannot drift from the semantics. K&L's classification refines
[ladusaw-1979]'s: every Ladusaw-DE context is a strengthening context, but K&L additionally
explain adversative predicates (DE on a constant perspective) and conditionals with implicit
restrictions. -/

/-- Ladusaw-DE contexts are K&L strengthening contexts; Ladusaw describes *where* NPIs occur, and
K&L explain *why*. -/

  unfold IsDownwardEntailing at hDE
  cases h : ctx.licenser <;> rw [h] at hDE <;> first | rfl | exact hDE.elim

/-! ### Adversative predicates: *sorry* vs *glad*

K&L §3.3 reduce the adversatives to *want* on a constant perspective: being sorry that `A` is
wanting `A` false, and being glad that `A` is wanting `A`. Wanting a set empty entails wanting each
of its subsets empty, so *sorry* satisfies the strengthening condition; wanting a set inhabited does
not entail wanting each subset inhabited, so *glad* does not. -/

section Adversatives

variable {World : Type*} (best : World → Set World)

/-- On a perspective whose best worlds at `w` are `best w`, one wants `A` at `w` when those best
worlds are `A`-worlds. Being glad that `A` is wanting `A`. -/
def wants (A : Set World) : Set World := {w | best w ⊆ A}

/-- Being sorry that `A` is wanting `A` false on the same perspective. -/
def sorryThat (A : Set World) : Set World := wants best Aᶜ

/-- *Sorry* satisfies the strengthening condition, so it licenses *any*. -/
theorem strengthening_sorryThat {Entity : Type*} {D D' : Set Entity} (P : Entity → Set World)
    (hD : D ⊆ D') : Strengthening (sorryThat best) D D' P :=
  de_satisfies_strengthening (fun _ _ h _ hw ↦ hw.trans (Set.compl_subset_compl.2 h)) D D' P hD

end Adversatives

/-- *Glad* fails the strengthening condition, so it does not license *any*. The best world bought
the `false` car, so one is glad that some car was bought but not that the `true` car was. -/
theorem not_strengthening_wants :
    ¬ Strengthening (wants fun _ : Bool ↦ {false}) {true} .univ fun x ↦ {x} := by
  intro h
  obtain ⟨x, rfl, hfx⟩ := h (a := true) (fun w _ ↦ ⟨w, Set.mem_univ w, rfl⟩) rfl
  exact Bool.false_ne_true hfx

/-! ### Conditional antecedents

K&L §3.5 treat conditionals and adversatives as one pattern — DE with a
parameter held constant (the implicit restriction, resp. the perspective);
in mathlib terms, `Antitone (f param)` for fixed `param`. Under the
restrictor analysis of conditionals (cf. [kratzer-1986]), the antecedent of
conditional necessity is classically DE once the modal base is fixed, so
widening the antecedent domain strengthens the conditional. -/

/-- Conditional antecedents satisfy strengthening, since conditional necessity is DE in its
antecedent with the modal base held constant. In K&L's (143), *If John subscribes to any
newspaper, he gets well informed*, widening *newspaper* to include unimportant newspapers
strengthens the conditional. -/
theorem conditional_satisfies_strengthening {W : Type*}
    (domain : W → Set W) (β : Set W) :
    Antitone (Conditional.strictImp domain · β) :=
  fun _ _ h ↦ Conditional.strictImp_anti_left h

/-- A conditional with an implicit restriction (K&L's (147)) is true when every relevant case
satisfying the restriction and the antecedent satisfies the consequent. -/
def conditionalWithRestriction {Case : Type*}
    (restriction antecedent consequent : Case → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ c, restriction c → antecedent c → consequent c

/-- **Widening always satisfies strengthening in conditional antecedents**
(K&L §3.5.3). Natural-language conditionals are not classically DE — their
(140) does not entail (141) — because the implicit restriction can shift. But
the restriction cannot undo the effect of widening, so the wide restriction
is never stronger than the narrow one, and then the wide conditional entails
the narrow one. Strengthening inferences "do always go through, because
of the relation between the restrictions of the premise and of the
conclusion. The two restrictions are always the same, except that the
restriction of the premise may be somewhat weaker (but never stronger), as
dictated by the widening", in K&L's words. -/
theorem widening_satisfies_conditional_strengthening {Case : Type*}
    {R_narrow R_wide A_narrow A_wide consequent : Case → Prop}
    (hRestrWeaker : ∀ c, R_narrow c → R_wide c)

    (hWide : conditionalWithRestriction R_wide A_wide consequent) :
    conditionalWithRestriction R_narrow A_narrow consequent :=
  fun c hR hA ↦ hWide c (hRestrWeaker c hR) (hAntWeaker c hA)

/-! ### Negated because-clauses: metalinguistic licensing

K&L §3.4, contra [linebarger-1987]: `not because [S_]` is not DE (*because
[S_]* is not UE, so negating it yields no DE context), while `not because of
[NP_]` is DE and licenses *any* freely — (122)/(123) need no negative
implication. In `because [S_]`, *any* is licensed only metalinguistically:
the negation denies *because*'s factive presupposition, and *any* strengthens
that denial. Merely implying the denial is not enough — the rhetorical
conditional (132) can imply it but lacks the metalinguistic denial, and *any*
is out. This is the paper's only genuinely non-DE licensing mechanism. -/

/-! ### FC *any* as generic indefinite

K&L's component (FC): PS *any* is a regular indefinite, FC *any* a generic
indefinite; the apparent universal force of FC *any* emerges from genericity
plus widening (§4.3). The episodic/generic split below is projected from the
substrate's mechanism classification. K&L themselves analyze only plain
generics like (10) and tentatively extend to modals; routing
imperatives and free relatives through the generic mechanism follows the
substrate, not K&L's text (they explicitly defer directives to later work and
never discuss free relatives). -/

/-- The indefinite containing *any* is interpreted episodically (PS *any*) or generically
(FC *any*). -/
inductive AnyInterpretation where
  | episodic
  | generic
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The interpretation of *any* in a licensing context is projected from the licensing
mechanism, and is generic exactly when the substrate classifies the context as licensed by the
generic indefinite. -/

/-! ### Vague restrictions and precisifications

K&L §4.1: *every owl* is **domain precise** — context determines a unique
domain — while generic *an owl* is **domain vague**: the normalcy restriction
is inherently underspecified, and different precisifications yield different
domains. This is what lets generics tolerate exceptions ("a poodle gives live
birth" survives male poodles). The `Set`-based notions are stated locally
because the supervaluation substrate (`Semantics/Supervaluation`,
[fine-1975]) is `Finset`-based for computability; the finite-case bridge is
`VagueRestriction.toSpecSpace` below. -/

together with its consistent completions, each extending the precise part, which is itself a

/-! ### Dimensional universality

K&L (175)–(177): after widening along a dimension {P, ¬P}, no entity is
excluded on the basis of that dimension, so the quantifier is universal with
respect to it. *Any CN* is dimensionally universal; generic *a CN* is not.
Since *almost* requires a domain-precise universal or a dimensionally
universal NP, this derives *almost any owl* vs ungrammatical *almost an owl*
(§4.3). -/

/-! ### Generic quantification as vague universality

K&L §4.1.1: a generic is a universal restricted by a vague set of properties, "An owl hunts mice"
being ∀ ↾ X_owl(Owl)(Hunts mice), (158) and (159), which (161) glosses as *all normal owls hunt
mice*, with what counts as normal inherently vague. The vague set plays the part of GEN's
normality: a precisification induces a `Genericity.Normality`, whose normal owls are the owls
with its properties, and the generic under a precisification is GEN under that normality.
Exception tolerance is the freedom to choose another precisification. -/

/-- Under the normality a precisification induces (161), the normal instances of a restrictor are
those with every property of the precisification. -/

When the precisification set is finite, K&L's truth notions are
[fine-1975]'s: `genericSuperTrue` is super-truth on the induced
specification space, and the exception-tolerance zone — sub-true but not
super-true — is exactly Fine's borderline (`indet`) status. "A poodle gives
live birth" is Fine-indefinite and K&L-assertable. -/
