# Pustejovsky (1995): The Generative Lexicon

This file formalizes the type coercion of the seventh chapter of [pustejovsky-1995]. Type
coercion (16) converts an argument to the type a function expects where application would
otherwise fail, and function application with coercion (17) applies a function either
directly, when the argument has the selected type, or through one of the shifting operators
available to the argument, and otherwise produces a type error (`Shifter`, `Applies`). The
available operators are of two kinds. Subtype coercion (23) follows the inferences of a
single type lattice, the one of Figure 6.1 extended by the chains of §7.1.2, so that *drive*
accepts *a Honda* through Honda ≤ car ≤ vehicle (`SemType`, `subtype_readings`,
`subtype_within_lattice`). True complement coercion (§7.1.3) instead
reaches through the qualia: *begin* selects an event, *a book* is a dot object of
information and physical object whose telic and agentive qualia name reading and writing
events (29), and the two event readings of *John began a book* (27) are exactly the two
qualia projections (`begin_book_readings`), each leaving the type lattice
(`book_qualia_leave_lattice`). The coerced complement embeds the noun phrase in the event
expression (31), and on a model where a reading of the book is not a writing of it the two
readings differ (`telic_ne_agentive`). Where the noun has no event-typed alias, *Mary began
the rock* of the fourth chapter, coercion fails (`begin_rock_no_reading`).

## Implementation notes

Types are the sorts of the paper's examples with an explicit ancestor list each, the dot
object *book* inheriting from both information and physical object; a quale enters coercion
by the type it projects, its relational content only in the model of (31), and the formal and
constitutive qualia project no alias. The *want* and *believe* paradigms of §7.1 and the
aspectual coercion of the ninth chapter are not formalized.
