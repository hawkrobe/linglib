# Farkas and Roelofsen (2017): Division of Labor in Declaratives and Interrogatives

This file formalizes [farkas-roelofsen-2017]'s account of falling and rising declaratives,
polar interrogatives and tag interrogatives: their inquisitive semantics, the single basic
convention of use that replaces the Fregean force operators, and the special discourse effects
of the marked forms. A sentence form is a clause-type marker with an intonation, or a declarative
anchor with a tag (`Form`, §4.1); the markers are interpreted by the projection operators
of inquisitive semantics (31), (34), (36): `dec` is the non-inquisitive projection
`Question.bang`, `int` the non-informative projection `Question.query` applied only to a
non-inquisitive argument, falling intonation is vacuous and rising intonation is `Question.query`
again. `Form.interpret` composes them as in (37)–(40): a falling declarative expresses
`!P` and every other form `?!P`, so that with a non-inquisitive radical the rising declarative,
the polar interrogatives and the tag interrogatives express one and the same inquisitive
proposition (`interpret_declarative_falling`, `interpret_marked`, `interpret_interrogative_ofSet`,
`isInquisitive_interpret_ofSet`; (41) and (43)). Among the forms for that content the polar
interrogatives are optimal and the rest marked (`Form.IsMarked`, (47)).

A discourse context is a stack of propositions, a commitment state, and for each participant the
possibilities she has signalled evidence for with a credence interval (the paper's (22) and §3.2;
`Context`, `Context.cs`, `Context.cg`, `Context.CommonlyDecided`). The basic convention of use
`Context.basic` puts the proposition on the table and commits the speaker to its informative
content (48); a falling declarative thereby commits her to the radical and the inquisitive
forms commit her to nothing (`cs_basic_declarative_falling`, `cs_basic_of_isInquisitive`; their
(49) and (50)). The special effects of the marked forms add the highlighted alternative to the
speaker's evidence with the credence interval of (52), (56) and (58), `[zero, low]` for the
rising declarative, `[moderate, high]` for the rising tag and `[high]` for the falling tag
(`Form.specialEffect`); `Context.utter` is the full conventional effect, and
`utter_eq_basic_of_not_isMarked` is the division of labor principle (21): the discourse
effects of the unmarked forms are the basic convention alone. §6 tests the account in
contexts that fix the speaker's evidence and credence; `Felicitous` renders the reasoning of that
section on a `Situation`, and `rows_felicitous` checks it against all sixty judgments of
(53)–(77).

## Implementation notes

* The felicity conditions of §6 are the paper's prose reasoning made explicit: a commitment to
  the radical needs high credence to be possible in the context; an inquisitive proposition on
  the table needs an addressee who is not neutral (61); an unmarked inquisitive form
  presents the speaker as neutral, which needs low credence to be possible (the paper's (63) against
  (65) and (67)); a marked form needs evidence for the highlighted alternative and a credence
  the context allows within the form's interval.
* The paper's `⟨?⟩` is a classical case split on inquisitiveness, so `Form.interpret` is
  noncomputable. Highlighting is the radical's own alternative, which the operators leave in
  place, so the forms take the radical's proposition `ofSet α` and `α` is the highlighted
  alternative by construction.
* The common ground is derived from the commitment sets as the paper derives it, not stored.
