# Gunlogson (2001): True to Form: Rising and Falling Declaratives as Questions in English

This file formalizes chapters 3 and 4 of [gunlogson-2001], the context-update semantics of rising
and falling declaratives and the account of when a declarative can be a polar question. A context
is a pair of commitment sets, and a locution, a sentence type with its intonation (73), updates
one of them: a declarative narrows the targeted set to its content (74), an interrogative leaves
it alone (87), and the rise or fall selects the addressee's or the speaker's set (75), (76),
`Locution.update`. The statuses of a proposition in a context, commitment, joint commitment,
resolution, controversy, bias, and neutrality (63) to (68), are those of
`Discourse/Commitment/Declarative.lean`; this file adds the reduction-set characterization of
bias (69) to (71), `IsBiasedR`. Chapter 3 classifies locutions by their effect: the theorems that
no declarative is neutral and no interrogative biasing (91), (92),
`Locution.not_isNeutralIn_of_decl`, the expression of commitment (93), and entailment,
informativeness, and vacuousness (94) to (101), which separate a locution entailed by a context
from one uninformative in it. Chapter 4 defines a
polar question as a locution uninformative with respect to the addressee's commitment set (104),
(132), `Locution.IsPolarQuestion`, which for a declarative is the Contextual Bias Condition (105),
makes every rising declarative question reiterative (134) and without effect (133), and makes the
falling declarative the only resolving question (135). The dissertation's locution triples are the
rows of `Data.Examples.Gunlogson2001`.

## Implementation notes

Presuppositional admittance, (83) and (84), is not modelled, so consistency (86) is the
nonemptiness of the updated commitment sets, and the second clause of the final definition of
polar question (136), which is not a condition on commitment sets, is left out. Theorem (91) does
not hold as stated: a resolved proposition is controversial for no one under (66), so a resolved
context is neutral under (68), and a declarative whose content the addressee already holds makes
it a joint commitment and so is neutral, `Locution.isNeutralIn_fallingDecl`. The theorem holds
when the content stays unresolved, which is the form given here, and (93) correspondingly fails
for declaratives as literally defined. The reduction-set definition of bias (71), which the paper
says is equivalent to (67), agrees with it exactly on unresolved propositions,
`isBiasedR_iff_isBiased_of_not_isResolved` and `isBiasedR_of_isJoint`.
