# Bar-Asher Siegal 2026: causation and causal relations

A review of how natural language encodes causation, from causative constructions and
conditionals to discourse coherence and the progressive, arguing that language is evidence
for the architecture of causal cognition. Its central proposal takes causal knowledge to be a
structural equation model in which several sets of conditions are each sufficient for an
effect: the door of Figure 1 opens when the handle is turned with the lock off, or when the
circuit is closed with the power on and the lock off. Causative constructions then differ in
which condition they may select as the cause. A change-of-state verb selects the temporally
final condition of a sufficient set, *cause* selects any of its conditions, and both select
only from the one sufficient set completed in the world of evaluation. Fodor's entailment from
*Sam opened the door* to *Sam caused the door to open* follows, its converse fails, and when
two sufficient sets are completed at once neither construction applies.

## Implementation notes

The door is a causal model whose exogenous variables (handle, lock, power, button) read the
context, and situations are observations. Sufficient sets and the two selection constraints are
stated over the Kleene development of an observation (`CausalModel.Forced`), after
[baglini-bar-asher-siegal-2025].
