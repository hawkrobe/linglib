# Zwarts (2005): Prepositional Aspect and the Algebra of Paths

Zwarts analyzes the aspect of directional prepositional phrases, which denote sets of paths. A
telic phrase like *to the house* differs from an atelic one like *towards the house* in closure
under the partial concatenation of paths: an atelic phrase is cumulative and a telic one
bounded, that is, not cumulative. Bounded phrases are not quantized, and loops are telic in
Krifka's sense yet cumulative, so neither quantization nor that telicity characterizes
boundedness. A trace homomorphism for concatenation transfers closure from the phrase to the
verb phrase, so *walk to the house* is bounded because no two *to the house* paths concatenate.
The path algebra is `Semantics/Events/Path`; closure is stated here over any ternary
concatenation relation.

## Main definitions

* `Cumulative`: closure under concatenation.
* `Bounded`: the absence of cumulativity.
* `toPP`: the endpoint content of the strict goal phrase.
* `towardsPP`: *towards*.
* `IsTraceHom`: a trace homomorphism for concatenation.

## Main results

* `toPP_bounded`: strict goal phrases are bounded.
* `towardsPP_cumulative`: *towards* is cumulative.
* `toPP_not_quantized`: bounded phrases are not quantized.
* `loops_cumulative`: loops are cumulative.
* `vpp_toPP_bounded`: *walk to the house* is bounded.

## Implementation notes

* The strict goal and source denotations enter through their endpoint content only.
* The paper's trace function respects Rothstein's partial event concatenation, not an
  unrestricted mereological sum.

## TODO

* The full single-phase definitions (35), (36), (39) and (40), and the minimality and grinder
  operators (63) and (64).

/-! ### Cumulativity and boundedness (17b), (21)

Stated over an arbitrary ternary concatenation relation: Appendix A pairs the
path algebra with an event algebra of the same shape, and §3.2 transfers
closure properties along a homomorphism between the two. -/

/-- A set is cumulative, (17b), when some concatenation exists within it, the non-vacuity clause
of fn. 7, and it is closed under concatenation. -/

/-! ### Quantization and Krifka-telicity are the wrong notions (§3.1)

(22) transplants [krifka-1998]'s quantization and telicity to path sets;
Zwarts shows neither characterizes boundedness. Quantization is
`Mereology.QUA` over the subpath order. -/

reference object and does not end there. -/
def fromPP (x : Loc) : Set (Path Loc) := {p | p.source = x ∧ p.goal ≠ x}

/-- No two *to x* paths concatenate, since the first ends at `x` and the second never starts
there. -/

/-! ### Towards and away from (§4.1.3)

The comparative definitions over a distance measure `d` to the reference
object: cumulative, hence unbounded — grounding the atelic marking of the
comparative prepositions in the fragments' directionality × telicity data. -/

measured by `d`. -/

/-- Bounded phrases are not quantized, (23)–(24), since a *to x* path has proper subpaths that are
also *to x*, against the [krifka-1998] characterization of telicity. -/
