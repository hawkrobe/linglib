# Denić et al. (2021): The influence of polarity items on inferential judgments

Participants rated how far a conclusion follows from a premise that differs from it in a superset
and a subset verb phrase (*saw birds*, *saw doves*), inside ten environments the paper classes as
upward entailing, downward entailing, non-monotone (*exactly 12*, *only 12*) or doubly negative, a
downward-entailing operator inside another. A negative polarity item in the premise lowered the
directional rating of the non-monotone environments in all four experiments and the
meta-analysis, and the positive polarity item *some* raised that of the doubly negative ones in
Experiment 3 and the meta-analysis (§8.1); the printed results are in
`Data/Experiments/DenicEtAl2021.json`. Here each environment denotes a function of its verb phrase
built from the substrate's quantifiers, from which the paper's classes and valid inferences follow.
The meaning route of §10.2 combines Kadmon and Landman's domain widening for *any* with Chater and
Oaksford's probabilistic semantics of quantified sentences.

## Main statements

* `Environment.classifies_iff`: the class the paper gives each environment is the one its
  denotation has, the doubly negative ones being upward entailing with the item in a
  downward-entailing constituent (§3.1.2, §5).
* `monotone_wideSome`: on its wide-scope reading *some* sits in an upward-entailing position
  whatever the environment, the confound of (9) and (27).
* `cond_eq_one_of_widen`, `exists_cond_lt_one_of_widen`: widening the domain of the object, (30),
  weakens the bridge premise of the probabilistic downward inference (33), and strictly so for
  some believer, (34).

## Implementation notes

* The English fragment gives *many* no reading; a model fixes one of Partee's cardinal and
  proportional readings, and every result holds for both. *Few* is the fragment's proportional
  reading.
* *Only 12* is its presupposition and assertion together, at least and at most twelve, which is
  *exactly 12* (`Environment.denotation_only12`); its Strawson reading is not the paper's class.
* *No alien spent a year without seeing birds* is *no* over the aliens and the year-spenders who
  did not see birds.
