# Zani, Ciardelli and Sanfelici (2026): Simplification of Disjunctive Antecedents

This file formalizes the semantic predictions that [zani-ciardelli-sanfelici-2026] tests in
an acquisition study of conditionals with disjunctive antecedents, *if A or B, C*. The three
readings of Table 2 are truth conditions over a similarity model: the simplification reading
SDA is the conjunction of the two simplifications, the substrate's `distributiveImp`; the
disjunctive conditional reading `DCR` is their disjunction; and the asymmetric reading AR is
the simplification of the more realistic disjunct. Under [lewis-1973]'s minimal-change
semantics, the substrate's `disjunctiveImp`, the DAC quantifies over the closest worlds of the
disjunction, and §2's case analysis follows: when neither disjunct is more realistic than the
other the DAC is equivalent to SDA (`would_iff_distributive_of_equallyRealistic`), and when
one is more realistic it is equivalent to that disjunct's simplification
(`would_iff_of_moreRealistic`). The readings are ordered by strength, SDA entails AR entails
DCR (`would_of_distributive`, `dcr_of_would`).

The experiment's target items (9) are evaluated in the race scenario of §4: the squirrel and
the tortoise compete, the prize named in the consequent belongs to one of them, and the
similarity orderings of Figure 3 make the squirrel a more realistic winner than the tortoise
or tie them. Table 3's response patterns follow by computation (`table3_sda`, `table3_dcr`,
`table3_ar`), and acceptance of the closeness evaluation item *if the hare doesn't win, the
squirrel will win* reveals that the participant regards the squirrel as the more realistic
winner (`moreRealistic_of_closeness`). On the homogeneity accounts of [santorio-2018] and
[cariani-goldstein-2020], SDA is the universal and DCR the existential resolution of the
homogeneous quantification over the disjuncts (`dcr_iff_homogeneity_ne_false`), which is the
source of the paper's prediction that children shift from DCR to SDA as they do for plural
definites; on [bar-lev-fox-2020]'s account, the literal meaning is Lewis's (`literal_eq_would`)
and exhaustification strengthens it to SDA (`distributive_of_exh`).

## Implementation notes

* A proposition is more realistic than another at `w` when it has closest worlds and each of
  them is strictly closer than every closest world of the other (`MoreRealistic`); the case
  analysis of §2 assumes total similarity preorders on finitely many worlds.
* The scenario's worlds are the three possible winners, ordered by speed from the actual
  world in which the hare wins; the two orderings realize the conditions of Figure 3.

## TODO

* The response patterns of Tables 5–8, the rates of Figures 4 and 5 and the regression of
  Table 4 await a data format for experimental results.
