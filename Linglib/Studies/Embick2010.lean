# Embick (2010): Localism versus Globalism in Morphology and Phonology

This file formalizes [embick-2010]'s C₁-LIN theory of contextual allomorphy: a node conditions
the Vocabulary Insertion ([halle-marantz-1993]) of another only when the two are concatenated and
active in the same cycle of Spell-Out. The category-defining heads are cyclic. Merging one spells
out the cyclic domains in its complement, so a cyclic head and the noncyclic heads attached to it
are realized in the cycle of the next cyclic head, the Domain Corollary, while the complement of
an inner cyclic head is inactive when an outer one is spelled out, the Activity Corollary; nodes
with null exponents are pruned from the concatenation statements. The case studies follow. The
Latin perfect indicative takes its special agreement endings only where a null present tense is
pruned between Agr and Asp[perf], the overt tenses of the other perfects intervening (§3.1.1); a
theme vowel reads the conjugation class of the node it is concatenated with, the root's across a
null v and *-ess*'s otherwise (§3.1.2); root-attached n has root-determined allomorphs while the
gerund's n, an outer cyclic head, has none, and *-ity* and *-ation* are potentiated by the *-able*
and *-ize* they follow (§2.2–2.3, §3.3); the noncyclic past tense and plural see the root across
pruned categorizers (§2.3.3); and the Hindi agentive Voice ([kratzer-1996]) shows root-determined
allomorphy in the transitive but only its default in the indirect causative, where the root lies
two cycles down (§3.2.2).

## Implementation notes

* Cycles, coactivity, the root's domain and adjacency across pruned heads are the substrate's
  `Spine` API; this file contributes the heads of the case studies, the rows, and the predictions
  checked over them. A row records a word's heads innermost first with their exponents, the head
  whose realization is at issue, its conditioner, the root or another head, and whether the book
  attests or excludes the conditioning.
* The examples are `Data.Examples.Embick2010`.

/-- Root-determined allomorphy is attested exactly where the target sees the root: in the first
cycle, across pruned heads only. The gerund's n and the indirect causative's Voice are outside
the root's domain, and *-ess* blocks the theme's view of the root. -/
