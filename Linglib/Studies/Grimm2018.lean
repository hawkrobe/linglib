# Grimm (2018): Grammatical Number and the Scale of Individuation

Grimm orders the individuation types of nominal descriptions on a scale, substances below granular
aggregates below collective aggregates below individuals (`IndividuationType`), and argues that a
language's grammatical number categories partition the scale by an order-preserving map (section
3.4). No category then spans two disconnected segments of the scale
(`ordConnected_fiber_of_monotone`), and this is all that order preservation asks: a classification
whose classes are contiguous is monotone for an order on its classes
(`exists_linearOrder_monotone_iff`). The impossible system of Table 21 fails under every ordering of
its classes (`bad_not_monotone`). The systems of Table 20 and section 4.1, Dagaare with a class per
type, the tripartite Welsh, Turkana, Maltese, and Miraña, binary English, and Yudja with number on
humans alone, are monotone classifications (`welsh_monotone` and its siblings). Markedness follows
the scale: the zero-coded value of a class is single reference for individuals and multiple
reference for aggregates, with no contrast at the bottom (`welsh_default_monotone` and its
siblings), and Dagaare's inverse marking is one coded value read in the two directions. Animacy
refines the picture (section 4.2): on the product of the scale with the animacy hierarchy, the
collective/singulative class ascends from below, the inverse of Smith-Stark's plural marking, and
the regions of Maltese, Welsh, and Turkana nest (`collective_regions_nest`).

## Implementation notes

The individuation types are primitive, as in the paper: equivalence classes of nominal
descriptions by individuation properties, which the paper ranks by perceptibility of minimal
units, spatial separation, consistency of shape, and interaction, and which section 4.3 extends
to function for artifacts. Grimm's dissertation derives the middle of the scale from the
strength of the connection relation under which aggregate nouns' referents cluster
(`Mereology.IsCluster`).
Each language's countability classes are an enumeration ordered by scale position, and the
classification of the four individuation types is the language's row of Table 20, 23, or 24.
Turkana and Maltese share Welsh's partition and differ in agreement and animacy reach, Yudja
shares English's and differs in restricting the contrast to humans; the classification does not
record these. The animacy tiers of Fig. 3, inanimates below Haspelmath's lower and higher
animates below humans, are ranks of the library's `AnimacyRank`; the full animacy–individuation
lattice, an Aissen product, and the connected region constraint (28) over it are not
formalized.

Granular aggregates and individuals share a singular/plural class while the collective
aggregates between them form a collective/singulative class, so the singular/plural class is

/-! ### Coding and markedness, sections 3.4 and 4.4

Each class codes one value of its contrast and leaves the other zero. The prediction: the
zero-coded default of a class tracks its individuation, multiple reference for aggregate classes
and single reference for individual classes, with no contrast at the bottom. -/

/-- A countability class codes its number contrast in one of four patterns. -/
inductive ClassCoding where
  /-- The class has no number contrast. -/
  | noContrast
  /-- The aggregate is zero-coded and the unit, the singulative, is coded. -/

/-! ### Countability and animacy, section 4.2

Plural marking descends the animacy hierarchy from the top, as Smith-Stark found; the
collective/singulative class ascends it from below, since the more animate an entity the more it
is construed as occurring singly. Welsh's collective class stops at small and middle-sized
animals, Turkana's reaches types of people, Maltese's barely passes insects (Fig. 4). -/

/-- Fig. 4 compares three tripartite languages. -/
inductive CollectiveLang where
  | maltese

covers everything from inanimate aggregates up to it. -/
def collectiveCeiling : CollectiveLang → Reference.Prominence.AnimacyRank

  | .welsh => .higherAnimal
  | .turkana => .human

/-- The collective regions nest, Maltese within Welsh within Turkana, each the down-set of its
ceiling. -/

    collectiveCeiling .maltese ≤ collectiveCeiling .welsh ∧
