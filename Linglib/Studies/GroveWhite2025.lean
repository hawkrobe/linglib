# Grove and White (2025): Factivity, Presupposition Projection, and Discrete Knowledge

This file formalizes the response models of Grove and White, who ask whether the gradience of
projection judgments comes from resolved indeterminacy, factivity being a discrete property of
token occurrences, or from unresolved indeterminacy. A model is a distribution over answers in
the unit interval to *how likely is it that φ?*. Factivity is resolved when a reading of the
predicate is drawn and the answer computed under it, and unresolved when it enters the
probability of the answer. World knowledge is gradient when the answer is the complement's
probability and discrete when it is the complement's truth at a drawn index. The four
combinations are the models the paper fits to Degen and Tonhauser's projection data; they share
their mean answer and differ in spread.

## Main definitions

* `likely`: the probability of a proposition under a distribution over indices.
* `update`: the common ground conditioned on a reading of the lexical entry (13).
* `resolvedFactivity`, `unresolvedFactivity`: the completions of a norming model by factivity.
* `discreteFactivity`, `whollyDiscrete`, `whollyGradient`, `discreteWorld`: the four models.

## Main results

* `discreteFactivity_eq_bind_update`, `whollyDiscrete_eq_bind_update`: the resolved models
  draw a reading of (13) and answer from the common ground updated with it.
* `discreteFactivity_eq`, `whollyDiscrete_eq`, `whollyGradient_eq`, `discreteWorld_eq`: the
  models in closed form.
* `integral_discreteFactivity` and its siblings: the four share the mean answer.
* `variance_whollyGradient` and its siblings: only the models with a discrete component spread.

## Implementation notes

Updating the common ground conditions a prior over `Factivity.World` on a reading's content,
belief and the complement being independent under the prior; under unresolved factivity the
factivity value of an index is likewise independent of the complement. The response noise of
section 4.1, the truncated normal likelihood, is not modeled, so each model is the distribution
of the intended answer. The paper's illustrative sentences are rows of `GroveWhite2025.Examples`.
