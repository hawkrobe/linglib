# Lakoff (1970): Tense and Its Relation to Participants

This file formalizes the claim of [lakoff-1970] that the choice of a tense answers to the
participants and not only to the times: a past tense may report a present state the speaker no
longer treats as salient, a present tense survives under a past matrix when its content is new
to the hearer, the present perfect asks for a relevance the speaker grants, and a present tense
stands for a future one when the event is scheduled. `Perspective` extends the library's
Reichenbach frame with the two participant dimensions, the salience of the event to the speaker
and the novelty of the content to the hearer, and each of the paper's uses is a condition on
such a frame. A use of a tense is true when the relation of the event to the speech time lies
in the cell of the tense chosen (`IsTrueUse`) and false otherwise; the paper's judgments are
predicted by true use or by a licensed false use in a synthetic form
(`predicted_iff_acceptable`), the periphrastic *used to* being confined to true pasts
(`false_use_synthetic`).

## Implementation notes

The participant dimensions are propositions on the frame, and the frame is Reichenbach's; the
evidential refinement of the frame belongs to the later literature and is not used. The false
future of the paper's (4b) and (10a), a *will* for a present state not yet real to the speaker,
would need a second direction of salience and is not represented, nor is the ban on *used to*
under sequence of tense, (11b).
