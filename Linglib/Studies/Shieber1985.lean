# Shieber (1985): Evidence Against the Context-Freeness of Natural Language

This file proves Shieber's theorem that a language meeting his four claims about Swiss German
subordinate clauses is not context-free. The homomorphism `f` sends the words of the clauses to
letters, and the image of the language intersected with the regular language
`r = w a* b* x c* d* y` is `w aᵐ bⁿ x cᵐ dⁿ y`. Erasing `w`, `x` and `y` leaves `aᵐ bⁿ cᵐ dⁿ`,
which is not context-free, and the context-free languages are closed under homomorphisms and
under intersection with regular languages.

## Main definitions

* `Letter`: the letters of the image of `f`
* `caseSorted`: the regular language `r`
* `Claims f L`: the four claims about a language `L` whose words `f` sends to letters

## Main results

* `Claims.map_inf_caseSorted`: the image of the language intersected with `r`
* `Claims.not_isContextFree`: a language meeting the claims is not context-free
* `not_isContextFree_of_count_le`: the same with optional objects, under a one-sided Claim 3
* `acceptable_iff_perm`: Claim 3 against the paper's clauses (1)–(22)

## Implementation notes

The letters put the accusative *d'chind* and *laa* before the dative *em Hans* and *hälfe*, as the
schema of Claim 2 and `f` do; the prose of Claim 2 puts the datives first. In the data, a verb
requires the case of its entry in `German.Zurich.Verbs`, and a noun phrase bears the case its
gloss marks.

## TODO

Note 4 restricts Claim 3 to clauses with as many noun phrases as verbs, which does not suffice:
the image, with the frame erased, can then be `{aᵖ bᵠ cʳ dᵘ | p + q ≠ r + u} ∪ {aᵐ bⁿ cᵐ dⁿ}`,
the union of the context-free `{aᵖ bᵠ cʳ dᵘ | p + q ≠ r + u}` and `{aᵏ bʲ cᵏ dˡ}`. Stating the
counterexample needs the closure of the context-free languages under union.
