# Kwon and Lee (2026): Accessibility Markers in Korean

This file formalizes [kwon-lee-2026]'s three experiments on Korean null pronouns, the
colloquial overt pronoun *kyay*, and demonstrative-plus-noun full NPs as markers on
[ariel-2001]'s Accessibility Marking Scale. `KoreanRefForm` places the three forms on the
substrate's scale and inherits its linear order, so the form–function criteria, more accessible
forms being more attenuated and less informative, are monotonicity statements
(`attenuation_strictMono`, `informativity_antitone`). The paper's central finding, from the
globally ambiguous contexts of Experiment 3, is that subject-antecedent choice increases
strictly with accessibility (`subjectBias_strictMono`), separating the three forms
(`three_way_split`) while naturalness stays flat (`exp3_naturalness_flat`). Experiment 1 finds
the null pronoun most natural with a sole antecedent and no difference between the overt
pronoun and the full NP (`exp1_null_most_natural`, `exp1_overt_fullNP_close`); Experiment 2
finds only the null pronoun sensitive to a context biased against its subject preference, in
comprehension accuracy and in naturalness alike (`exp2_only_null_context_sensitive`,
`exp2_naturalness_only_null_asymmetric`), with trials interpreted as intended rated more
natural (`correct_trials_more_natural`).

The comparison the paper draws in its introduction with Italian ([carminati-2002]), Spanish
([contemori-di-domenico-2021]), Chinese ([zhang-kwon-2022]), and the earlier Korean studies
([kweon-2011], [choe-2021]) is recorded as `CrossLingProfile`s: the null pronoun is more
subject-biased than the overt one in every study (`null_gt_overt_universally`), the spread is
widest in Italian (`italian_widest_spread`), the present overt pronoun is object-biased as in
[kweon-2011] and unlike [choe-2021] (`overt_object_biased_as_kweon`), and in Korean the
null-versus-overt step in bias far exceeds the overt-versus-full-NP step (`null_nonnull_cliff`),
the paper's conclusion that the primary accessibility contrast in Korean is between null and
non-null forms.

## Implementation notes

Percentages are rounded to whole points as the paper reports them, means on the seven-point
scale to hundredths. *Kyay* is placed at the unstressed-pronoun level rather than at a
demonstrative one, following the paper's argument that it has become a third-person pronoun,
and the full NP at the distal-demonstrative-plus-noun level. Subject-bias values of the
comparison studies are complements of the reported object biases where only those are given.
