# Schlenker (2003): A Plea for Monsters

This file formalizes the paper's semantics of attitude verbs as quantifiers over contexts.
The Fixity Thesis of [kaplan-1989]'s direct-reference theory holds that the value of an
indexical is fixed by the context of the actual speech act and untouched by any operator, so
that no operator shifts contexts; the paper's counterexamples are the shifted indexicals of
Amharic, where the
first person under *say* denotes the reported speaker. An attitude verb therefore quantifies
over contexts of the reported speech act or thought, of which [hintikka-1962]'s
quantification over worlds is the special case where the embedded meaning reads only the
world coordinate (`ContextBox`, `contextBox_world_only`); the doxastic predicates of
`Semantics/Attitudes/Doxastic` are that special case with a veridicality check
(`doxastic_holdsAt_iff_contextBox`). The reported context is the innermost context after the
attitude shift, with the holder as agent and the accessible world as world
(`reportedContext`). The Fixity Thesis is rendered as independence of a meaning's truth value
from the context tower (`SatisfiesFixity`), which world-only meanings satisfy
(`fixity_world_only`), while English *I* resolves to the origin agent under any shift
(`english_I_invariant`) and Amharic *I* to the innermost agent, so the two diverge under a
shift to another holder (`amharicI_ne_I`). Person features are presuppositions on contexts,
and a logophoric pronoun is the author of an embedded context who is not the actual speaker
(`Logophoric`, `logophoric_local_of_ne`, `not_logophoric_origin_agent`). A two-person,
two-world model shows context quantification strictly exceeding world quantification: *Bob
said that I am happy* is false read as English and true read as Amharic
(`english_amharic_differ`).

## Implementation notes

The paper's context variables and its syntactic filtering of shiftable from non-shiftable
indexicals are not modelled; shiftability is the choice between the origin and the innermost
access pattern of `Semantics/Reference/Context/Tower`. A finite list of worlds renders the
quantification decidably, as in the doxastic substrate. A monstrous operator whose embedded
meaning consumes the whole shifted tower, needed for mixed origin and local readings, is not
defined.
