# Bar-Asher Siegal and Nadathur (2026): Modeling progress

This file formalizes the analysis of telic progressives in [bar-asher-siegal-nadathur-2026]. The
paper gives up the assumption that an accomplishment predicate `P` denotes only culminated
eventualities. Instead `P` introduces a causal model in which its culmination condition `C_P` is
a dependent variable, and the model's sufficient sets for `C_P` are the culmination procedures,
the recipes for `C_P`. A progressive is then about partial realization, not about modal
projections of culmination. `PROG(P)` is felicitous when `P` has a culmination procedure (33a).
It is true when the reference situation has initiated one, not completed any, and not completed a
sufficient set for non-culmination (34)–(36).

Situations assign each propositional variable 1, 0 or `u`, and a structural equation is read in
Kleene's three-valued way, as in Figure 1b and Table 2. Causal consistency (29) asks every settled
dependent variable to carry the value its equation gives. In a consistent situation, one fact is
causally necessary for another (30a) when the first is a causal ancestor of the second and every
consistent situation over the same variables that changes the first also changes the second. A
consistent situation is causally sufficient for one of its facts (30b) when each of its other
facts is necessary for it (`IsSufficient`). Its kernel is then a sufficient set, which contains
the effect itself.

On the dual-route door of Section 4.2 (`BarAsherSiegal2026.model`) the file checks:

* the two culmination procedures (38) and the three sufficient sets for non-culmination (39);
* that the electronic procedure must include the button, since without it the circuit is
  undetermined and the situation inconsistent (footnote 39);
* that *Nur is opening the door* (40) is true after the power has just been switched on, with
  handle and button unsettled (`prog_opening`);
* that (40) comes out false in the realistic context where the unturned handle and unpressed
  button complete a sufficient set for non-culmination, as the paper itself observes
  (`not_prog_realistic`);
* that the lock's state is a globally necessary condition (42), so that by (45) the progressive
  is undefined while the lock's state is unknown (43a) (`not_defined_of_lock_unknown`).

## Implementation notes

Situations are `Valuation`s over `Bool`. The three-valued value of an equation is the value on
which every completion of its parents' values agrees (`Determines`), which is Table 2's value for
the door's equations. The situations over the same variables as `s` are its reassignments
(`reassign`), so necessity quantifies over `V → Bool`. The paper times the initiating fact
against the interval just before reference time; here a single pre-reference situation `s₀`
stands in for that interval. The paper prints the sufficient sets (39b) and (39c) without the
effect fact ⟨O,0⟩, which Definition (30b) puts in every sufficient set; `sNotElec` and `sNotCirc`
include it.

## TODO

The paper's repair for the realistic context of (40), which lets a sufficient set for
non-culmination be undone by updating a fungible background variable (Section 4.2), is left
open, as it is in the paper.
