# Horn (1972): On the Semantic Properties of Logical Operators in English

This file formalizes [horn-1972]'s account of scalar predicates and of the lexicalization of
negated operators. A scale is a strict chain of propositions, each entailing the weaker ones
(`IsScale`); asserting a member asserts its lower bound and conversationally implicates the
negation of the stronger members, so that *some* implicates *not all*, a cardinal *n* asserts
at least *n* and implicates at most *n*, and *or* implicates *not and*. The implicature can be
asserted, contradicted or suspended, and suspension (*warm, if not hot*) is possible only by a
stronger member (`suspends_iff_lt`); of the stronger members, the further up the scale the
negated one lies, the safer the inference (`safer_of_le`), and the negation of the strongest is
forced. The relation between *some* and *not all* is implicature rather than entailment: the
two conjoin without redundancy and *some* is consistent with *all*.

Chapter 4 derives the missing O corner of Aristotle's square. An operator is *compatible* with
a lower negation when `Q φ` and `Q ¬φ` can hold together (`Compatible`); on the quantifier
scale this holds below the midpoint (*some*, *half*) and fails above it (*most*, *all*), and
for monotone quantifiers the compatibility of `Q` excludes that of its contradictory
(`not_compatible_compl`). The lexicalization hypotheses (4.59) and (4.62) let an outer
negation `~Q` lexicalize iff `Q` is compatible and an inner negation `Q~` iff it is not, so
*none* arises both as `~some` and as `all~` while `~all = some~` has no route
(`o_corner_unlexicalizable`); the connectives pattern alike, with *nor* but no *nand*.

## Implementation notes

* Quantifiers are conditions on the number of satisfiers out of a domain of size `n`, the
  operational procedure of (4.55); *many* and *few*, which depend on an expected size, are
  left out. Cardinals use the numeral substrate's lower-bound readings, and the connectives
  the substrate's `Alternatives.ConnWorld`.
* The modal and deontic scales, the polarity facts of Chapter 3 and the presupposition theory
  of Section 1.1 are not formalized.
