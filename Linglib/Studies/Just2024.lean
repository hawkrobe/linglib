# Just (2024): A structural and functional comparison of differential A and P indexing

This file formalizes [just-2024]'s claim that differential A indexing and differential P
indexing, the variable occurrence of a verbal index for reasons other than the referent's
argument role, are one phenomenon: a referent is indexed when it reaches a language-specific
level of referential prominence ([haspelmath-2021]), whatever its role. The two look like
mirror images because the roles differ in default prominence: A referents are typically
prominent, so a non-prominent or focused A loses an otherwise present index, while P referents
typically are not, so a topical, definite, or animate P gains one. The principle is
`Indexed`, prominence at or above the threshold, whose coding length is the cutoff split
`Reference.Prominence.atLeast`, and `deviation_coding` derives the mirror
image and its consequence for coding asymmetries: a referent that deviates from its role's
default receives longer coding exactly when the default is unindexed, so the generalization
of [haspelmath-2021] that deviations from role-reference associations are coded by longer
forms holds of differential P indexing and fails of differential A indexing, where the
deviating configuration loses the index. The examples of the paper's survey are rows, and
`indexed_iff_prominent` reads each as the paper does, the index present exactly where the
referent has the prominence the language demands, for A and P alike.

Co-argument sensitivity is the paper's other case: in Reyesano which of A and P is indexed
depends on the persons of both, its table being rows of `Clause.Scenario Person`, and
`no_ranking_fits` shows that no ranking of the persons predicts the table by indexing the
argument the scenario's kind under that ranking favours, as the paper argues after
[witzlack-makarevich-etal-2016] that hierarchies are not needed to describe such systems.

## Implementation notes

* Prominence is a linear order with a threshold; the paper's factors, identifiability,
  animacy, topicality, and person, are language-specific and enter the rows as the condition
  the paper names for each example.
* Coding length counts the index only, which is what the paper's argument about coding
  asymmetries concerns.

section Principle

variable {Prominence : Type*} [LinearOrder Prominence] (θ : Prominence)

/-- The principle: a referent is indexed when its prominence reaches the language's
threshold. -/
def Indexed (p : Prominence) : Prop := θ ≤ p

instance (p : Prominence) : Decidable (Indexed θ p) := inferInstanceAs (Decidable (θ ≤ p))

variable {ρ : Type*} (dflt : ρ → Prominence)

/-- A referent deviates from its role when it lies on the other side of the threshold from
the role's default prominence. -/

instance (r : ρ) (p : Prominence) : Decidable (Deviates θ dflt r p) :=
  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (_ ↔ _))

/-- The mirror image and the coding asymmetry: a deviating referent is coded longer than
its role's default exactly when the default is unindexed. Differential P indexing, with a
default below the threshold, codes the deviation by adding an index; differential A
indexing, with a default above it, codes the deviation by dropping one. -/
theorem deviation_coding {r : ρ} {p : Prominence} (h : Deviates θ dflt r p) :
    atLeast θ (dflt r) < atLeast θ p ↔ ¬ Indexed θ (dflt r) := by
  by_cases hd : θ ≤ dflt r
  · have hp : ¬ θ ≤ p := fun hp ↦ h.1 hp hd
    simp only [atLeast, ite_eq_left hd, ite_eq_right hp]
    exact ⟨fun h ↦ absurd h (by omega), fun h ↦ absurd hd h⟩
  · have hp : θ ≤ p := h.2 hd
    simp only [atLeast, ite_eq_right hd, ite_eq_left hp]
    exact ⟨fun _ ↦ hd, fun _ ↦ Nat.zero_lt_one⟩

/-- The deviating referent of a role indexed by default is coded shorter. -/

shorter than a default A and the P longer than a default P. -/

/-! ### The survey -/

/-- The condition under which the paper reports a referent indexed or not: the factor named
for the example. `focus` is focus on the referent, `otherFocus` focus on another constituent
of a language whose index requires predicate focus. -/

  | topical
  | focus
  | otherFocus
  | animate
  | inanimate
  | definite
  | indefinite
  | pronominal
  | lexical
  | predicateFocus
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- Whether a condition puts the referent at the prominence the language demands: topical,
animate, definite, and pronominal referents, and predicate focus, which leaves the arguments
unfocused; a focused, inanimate, indefinite, or lexical referent falls short, as does an
argument in a clause whose focus lies elsewhere than the predicate. -/

condition. -/

named condition, for A and for P. -/

/-- The arguments indexed in a scenario. -/
inductive IndexedArgs where
  | a
  | p
  | both

  let a ← r.parse? "aPerson" persons
  let p ← r.parse? "pPerson" persons
  let ix ← r.parse? "indexed" [("A", IndexedArgs.a), ("P", .p), ("AP", .both)]
  pure (⟨a, p⟩, ix)

/-- The Reyesano table. -/
def reyesano : List (Scenario Person × IndexedArgs) := Examples.all.filterMap scenario

/-- Indexing by a ranking of persons: the higher-ranked argument, the A in a downstream
scenario and the P in an upstream one, both when balanced. -/
def byRanking (rank : Person → Fin 3) (s : Scenario Person) : IndexedArgs :=
  match s.kindBy rank with
  | .downstream => .a
  | .upstream => .p
  | .balanced => .both

/-- Whether an A of a given person is indexed depends on the person of its co-argument. -/
theorem coargument_sensitive :
    ∃ s ∈ reyesano, ∃ s' ∈ reyesano, s.1.high = s'.1.high ∧ s.2 ≠ s'.2 := by
  decide +kernel

/-- No ranking of the tripartition predicts the table by indexing the higher-ranked
argument: a first-person A outranks a third-person P, but a third-person A ties with a
first-person P. -/
