# Boneh and Doron 2013: Hab and Gen in the expression of habituality

Boneh and Doron argue that habituality involves two covert operators. Gen is the familiar
modalized universal. Hab is a modalized existential over sums of events: an iteration in every
world of a gnomic modal base, with only an initiating event that indicates a disposition in the
actual world. The English auxiliaries mark neither; *would* marks mood, a special case of Gen,
and *used to* is the imperfective under a retrospective aspect, which places the reference
interval before the perspective interval. The operators are built on Link's sum closure,
Kratzer's modal base, Klein's imperfective and Pancheva's final-subinterval perfect
(`Aspect.perfect`); Del Prete's Italian Same-Object Effect is the configuration of
`same_object_infelicity`.

## Main statements

* `same_object_infelicity`: an indefinite scoping over Hab makes an unrepeatable event recur.
* `gen_admits_fresh_objects`: Gen's universal lets the object vary.
* `hab_without_actual_iteration`: Hab holds with a single actual initiating event.
* `retro_perfect_forces_point`: the retrospective and the perfect share a reference interval only
  at a degenerate perspective.
* `usedTo_of_persisting_state`: *used to* does not bound the state.

/-! ### Hab against Gen ((4)–(8), (13)–(15))

Gen needs an explicit restrictor; without one only Hab applies, and an
indefinite can only scope over it, as in (8) `∃x [cigarette(x) ∧ Hab e
smoke(e, Mary, x)]`. The contrast between (4a) and (4b) is then a theorem:
smoking is unrepeatable per cigarette, so the wide-scope form is
contradictory while Gen's (5a) is satisfiable with a fresh cigarette per
event. -/

/-! Iteration, (14), a sum of P-events with at least two distinct proper P-parts on Link's
closure, is `Mereology.IsPlural`. -/

/-- With the indefinite scoping over Hab, the same object recurs through the iteration, so the
reading is contradictory when the predicate is unrepeatable per object, one smoking per cigarette,
(4b), (8). -/
theorem same_object_infelicity {E C : Type*} [SemilatticeSup E]
    {smoke : E → C → Prop} {cig : C → Prop}
    (hOnce : ∀ c e₁ e₂, smoke e₁ c → smoke e₂ c → e₁ = e₂) :
    ¬ ∃ c, cig c ∧ ∃ e, Mereology.IsPlural (smoke · c) e :=
  fun ⟨c, _, e, hIter⟩ => Mereology.not_isPlural_of_subsingleton (hOnce c) e hIter

/-- Gen holds at the interval `i` and world `w` when every `Q`-individual temporally included in
`i` is a `P`-individual throughout the gnomic modal base of `i` at `w`, (21). It is GEN with
every case normal and its modality in the matrix. -/
def gen {W Z T : Type*} (P Q : Z → W → Prop) (τ : Z → Set T) (mb : Set T → ModalBase W)
    (i : Set T) (w : W) : Prop :=
  (i, w) ∈ (⊤ : Genericity.Normality (Set T × W) Z).gen {z | τ z ⊆ i ∧ Q z w}
    {z | Modality.simpleNecessity (mb i) (P z) w}

/-- Hab holds when an initiating event that indicates a disposition occurs in the actual world
and an iteration occurs in every accessible world of the gnomic modal base, (13), (15). The paper
leaves "indicating a disposition" unanalyzed, so it is a parameter, and the temporal anchoring
`τ(s) ⊆ τ(e)` is dropped with the event times. -/

/-! ### used to: the imperfective under a retrospective ((18)–(19), (30)–(35))

The auxiliary is the retrospective over the imperfective. The imperfective (19a) is Klein's,
`IMPF`, and the retrospective (19b) places the reference interval before the perspective
interval, Kamp and Reyle's P, so *used to* is imperfective and retrospective by construction. -/

/-- The retrospective holds at a perspective interval when some reference interval satisfying
the description lies wholly before it, (19b). -/
def retro {W T : Type*} [LinearOrder T] (A : W → Set (NonemptyInterval T)) :
    W → Set (NonemptyInterval T) :=

/-- *Used to* is the retrospective over the imperfective, (18). -/
def usedToOp {W T E : Type*} [LinearOrder T] [Event.TemporalTrace E T] (P : W → E → Prop) :
    W → Set (NonemptyInterval T) :=
  retro (IMPF P)

/-- One reference interval serves the retrospective and the perfect at once only for an
instantaneous perspective, (32)–(34). The two form the Horn scale behind the retrospectivity
implicature (31)–(33). -/
theorem retro_perfect_forces_point {T : Type*} [LinearOrder T]

    p.IsPoint :=
  le_antisymm p.fst_le_snd (hf.2.trans_le hb)

/-- Retrospectivity of the state is cancellable, as in *… used to go to. Still do.* (30), since
the imperfective (19a) bounds only the reference interval: a state whose run time properly
contains a reference interval before the perspective satisfies *used to* however far it runs. -/

of Table (41). The simple form takes either viewpoint, (26)–(27), and the periphrastic forms
only the imperfective. -/

  | _, .imperfective => True
  | _, .perfective => False

/-- `admitsPerspective f p` says that the form `f` admits the perspective `p`, the perspective

/-- *In the good old days, people would dress elegantly*, (2c), is infelicitous, since *would*

/-- *She used to go to work by bus*, (42c), is false on a single episode. The chapter derives the
actualization requirement from the aspect: the retrospective's extended reference interval
characterizes a period, and only actualized episodes can characterize one. -/

is Gen, an individual-level predicate is incompatible with an episodic restrictor, and a definite

/-- *A French teacher used to know Latin*, (3b), (47b), is ungrammatical, since *used to* is
aspectual rather than quantificational: the indefinite singular finds no operator below Gen, and
Gen over the whole clause, (50b), gives the wrong truth conditions. A bare plural instead denotes
the kind and combines directly, (50a). -/
