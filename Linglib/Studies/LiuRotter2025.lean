# Liu and Rotter (2025): Linguistic and Social Meaning Match

This file formalizes the modal concord experiment of [liu-rotter-2025]. Modal concord doubles
two modal elements of the same force and flavour, *may possibly* and *must certainly*; on
the semantic-vacuity account of [zeijlstra-2007] one element is uninterpretable, so a
concord sentence and its single-modal counterpart should be truth-conditionally identical.
The paper's 2 × 2 (force × number) Latin-square experiment on US English finds concord
non-vacuous, and in opposite directions: doubling strengthens speaker commitment for
necessity and weakens it for possibility, a force × number crossover, as the modal-spread
account of [giannakidou-mari-2018] predicts (`spreadEffect`, `spread_crossover`,
`spread_refutes_vacuity`). Confidence tracks commitment, the match of the title, while
friendliness, warmth, and coolness show a force-blind penalty for doubling
(`warmthEffect`, `warmth_ne_spread`). The observed shifts between the concord and
single-modal cell means carry exactly these signs (`commitment_matches_spread`,
`confidence_matches_spread`, `warmth_matches_penalty`).

## Implementation notes

The effect of concord is a `SignType`; the regression estimates are not formal commitments.
The cell means of the paper's Table 1 are rows of `Data/Examples/LiuRotter2025.json`, stored
as hundredths of the 1–7 scale and read structurally, so the observed signs are decided in
the kernel. The concord precondition, that the doubled elements share force, and the
auxiliaries' uninterpretability under the agreement account are read off the English
auxiliary fragment.

/-! ### The concord effect as a force-indexed sign -/

/-- The modal-spread account ([giannakidou-mari-2018]): the modal adverb of a concord
construction is not vacuous; doubling reinforces the force, raising speaker commitment for
necessity and lowering it for possibility. -/
def spreadEffect : ModalForce → SignType
  | .necessity     => 1
  | .weakNecessity => 1
  | .possibility   => -1

/-- The semantic-vacuity account ([zeijlstra-2007]): one modal carries an uninterpretable
feature and contributes no operator, so concord has no commitment effect under any force. -/
def vacuityEffect : ModalForce → SignType := λ _ => 0

@[simp] theorem spreadEffect_necessity : spreadEffect .necessity = 1 := rfl
@[simp] theorem spreadEffect_possibility : spreadEffect .possibility = -1 := rfl
@[simp] theorem vacuityEffect_apply (f : ModalForce) : vacuityEffect f = 0 := rfl

/-- The force × number interaction: the concord effect reverses sign with force. -/
theorem spread_crossover : spreadEffect .necessity ≠ spreadEffect .possibility := by decide

/-- Concord is non-vacuous: it shifts commitment under both forces. -/
theorem spread_nonvacuous :
    spreadEffect .necessity ≠ 0 ∧ spreadEffect .possibility ≠ 0 := by decide

/-- Vacuity predicts no interaction: the null effect is the same for every force. -/
theorem vacuity_no_interaction (f g : ModalForce) : vacuityEffect f = vacuityEffect g := rfl

/-- The crossover refutes vacuity, already at necessity. -/
theorem spread_refutes_vacuity : spreadEffect ≠ vacuityEffect :=
  λ h => absurd (congrFun h .necessity) (by decide)

/-! ### A second profile: the warmth penalty

The social-meaning measures split in two (Table 5). Confidence, and for necessity formality,
track commitment and show the same crossover; friendliness, warmth, and coolness show a
force-blind main effect of number, the concord sentence rated lower than the single modal
under both forces. -/

/-- The warmth profile: a force-blind penalty for doubling. -/

reverses. -/

/-! ### Predicting against the data

The four condition cells carry the Table 1 means of every measure in hundredths of the 1–7
scale. An account predicts the sign of the concord shift, concord minus single modal, per
force; the observed sign is read off the cell means. -/
