# Hyman (2006): Word-prosodic typology

This file formalizes [hyman-2006]'s two prototypes of word prosody and the argument that
pitch accent is no third. A language has tone when an indication of pitch enters the lexical
realization of some morpheme, definition (3) (`Tonal`); it has stress accent when word-level
metrical structure marks a head syllable in every lexical word, definition (5), which separates
into obligatoriness, at least one head (`Obligatory`), and culminativity, at most one
(`Culminative`), the pair that the usual *one and only one* conflates
(`obligatory_and_culminative_iff`). Obligatoriness is the definitional criterion, OBLHEAD,
and it targets syllables: a language whose words may lack syllables cannot have stress
accent (`not_obligatory_of_no_units`, Bella Coola), and an obligatory H assigned by mora is
restricted tone rather than stress accent (`kinga_not_stressAccent`).

The four combinations of the two criteria are all attested among restricted-H systems, Table
II: Kinga's antepenultimate-mora H is obligatory and culminative, Creek's tonal accent
obligatory but not culminative, Tokyo Japanese's accent culminative but not obligatory,
read off the accent lexicon of the Japanese fragment (`tokyo_not_obligatory`), and Seneca's
trochaic H neither, derived from the analysis of (21) (`seneca_not_obligatory`). So neither
criterion implies the other, no hierarchical typology can cut first by one and then by the
other, and the cut by OBLHEAD and the reviewer's cut by culminativity of Section 7 classify
Creek and Tokyo Japanese oppositely (`cuts_differ`).

## Implementation notes

* A `Marking` records, for each lexical word, its units and the units bearing the mark, the
  primary stress or the restricted tone; the tone-bearing unit is `Tone.TBUKind`. Tone is
  stated on a lexicon of morphemes with an optional pitch specification.
* Table I's quadrants remain the two Boolean dimensions of `Tone.WordProsody`, which the
  Drubea fragment and [lionnet-2025] instantiate; the languages of Table I are not listed.
