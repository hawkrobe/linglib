# Grano (2024): Intention Reports and Eventuality Abstraction in a Theory of Mood Choice

This file formalizes [grano-2024]'s account of why 'intend' accepts nonfinite and subjunctive
complements but rejects indicative ones across Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Greek,
Romanian, and English, as 'want' does and as 'hope' does not (Table 1). Three premises carry the
argument: intention reports have causally self-referential content ([searle-1983], [harman-1976]),
an intention being carried out only if it causes the outcome in the right way; encoding that content
takes abstraction over the complement's eventuality argument, since causation relates eventualities
(`Event.causedClosure_factorsThrough_iff`); and subjunctive and nonfinite clauses can leave that
argument open where the indicative closes it (`MoodHead`). The pool of the paper's judged
complements records each predicate's class, the complement type, and where it matters the reading,
and `abstraction_rejects_indicative` checks the conclusion over every row that requires abstraction:
intention reports, causatives, the intention-rigid *aim* and *try*, aspectual predicates, the
intention readings of *persuade*, *decide*, *promise*, and *plan*, and the event readings of memory
and perception reports. Section 3's case against [portner-rubinstein-2020] and
[giannakidou-mari-2021] is `intend_like_hope_in_logic`: on realism, consistency, and monotonicity
'intend' patterns with 'hope', whose indicative those theories license by that very profile, yet
every indicative row under 'intend' is rejected. The Hintikka semantics of (73) is the modal box
over intention alternatives, and the three properties follow from their overlap with the doxastic
alternatives (`realism` and its siblings); the verb entries of the language fragments record the
finite moods the pool accepts (`fragments_match_pool`); and section 7's synthesis reads the
availability of the indicative off the two departures from default clausal semantics, a pair of
modal backgrounds and eventuality abstraction (`indicative_possible_iff`).

## Implementation notes

The mood heads are those of section 5, (87) to (89): the subjunctive is ambiguous between a head
that closes the eventuality argument as the indicative does and one that passes it up, so an open
argument implies subjunctive or nonfinite form and not conversely. A head's clause denotes in a
sum type, a proposition or a predicate of eventualities, the type mismatch under 'intend' being
the absence of the second. Nonfinite complements carry the subjunctive's two heads, as the paper
says without illustrating. `sbjvCausal` is the alternative of section 7, (134), which moves the
quantification of 'intend' into the mood head.
Whether a class needs eventuality abstraction is the paper's premise per class; for the hybrid,
commissive, *plan*, memory, and perception predicates the reading of the row decides. The
simplification condition of [portner-rubinstein-2020] is read off the consistency rows: a pair of
backgrounds may collapse when the class rejects inconsistent prejacents. French *faire* with
indicative complements, (43a) and (44b), which the paper leaves as open exceptions, is not in the
pool, and the paper's remarks on nominal *avoir l'intention* and on French and Italian rejecting
non-control complements under 'intend' altogether are recorded as rows without a theorem.

(73) is necessity over the worlds compatible with the agent's intentions, `□[int]`. Its one
substantive constraint is that those worlds overlap the worlds compatible with the agent's
beliefs, `◇[int] (dox w) w`, from which realism, consistency, and monotonicity follow. (78) moves
to the de se triples of an intention state, and (79) adds the causal self-reference, closing the
complement's eventuality argument over what the state causes. -/
