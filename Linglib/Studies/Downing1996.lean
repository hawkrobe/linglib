# Downing (1996): Numeral Classifier Systems: The Case of Japanese

This file formalizes the semantic and pragmatic analysis of the Japanese numeral classifier system
in [downing-1996]. A numeral classifier is a form that follows a numeral, readily co-occurs with a
noun denoting the enumerated referent, and denotes a natural unit of that referent whose
characteristics dictate its choice, which excludes standard measures, containers, partitions and
groupings (Chapter 1); the core inventory of Table 1.1 and the extended inventory of Table 1.2 are
`Row`, each row's entry a classifier of `Japanese.Classifiers`. The monograph evaluates two
universalist hypotheses (Chapter 5). Hypothesis 1, after [denny-1976], is that classifiers encode
categories defined by parameters of physical, functional and social interaction, `Interaction`, and
the core inventory conforms to this extent, `core_interaction`, though the monograph finds the
system adulterated with categories of little cultural weight. Hypothesis 2 is that classifiers
supplement the information carried by nouns; the capacity lies with the quality-classifiers, whose
deductive categories in the sense of [hunn-1977] are united by one or two physical properties and
crosscut noun categories, against the kind-classifiers of inductive categories, `cohesion`, the
animal and boat categories being inductive categories split by the deductive parameter of size,
`sizeSplits`. The morphemes serving as classifiers mostly bear independent senses related to their
categories along the six recurrent patterns of Table 5.2, `MorphemeRelation`; a seventh pattern
attested in other languages is absent from Japanese, `relation_ne_sharedQuality`, only the pairs of
the first pattern are clones of noun categories, and no quality-classifier is one,
`quality_not_clone`. Chapter 7 reconsiders [sanches-slobin-1973]'s universal that classifier
languages lack obligatory plural marking and [greenberg-1972]'s collective/singulative rationale for
it: Japanese common nouns are transnumeral and its pronouns and proper nouns inherently singular,
`numberSystem`, so plural marking is required on the latter and at most possible on the former,
Table 7.2, `pluralMarking`, and is monotone in the animacy of the referent and the referentiality of
the noun phrase, `pluralMarking_mono_referent` and `pluralMarking_mono_head`, a plurality split in
the sense of [smith-stark-1974]; the same suffixes read as associative plurals on the singular heads
and as class plurals on the transnumeral ones, `reading`. Classifier phrases unitize and plural
markers maintain tracking-worthy individuals, so a group is introduced with the former and tracked
with the latter and never the reverse, `Tracks`. The anaphoric use of classifier phrases (Chapter 6)
and the four positions of the classifier phrase (Chapter 8) are represented by their examples.

## Implementation notes

The kind/quality distinction is derived from the semantic parameters of each row's category, coded
in Aikhenvald's vocabulary from the descriptions of the tables (`Row.params`): a parameter of
physical interaction, including [allan-1977]'s quanta, is deductive, one of functional or social
interaction inductive, and a classifier is a quality-classifier when its parameters are all
deductive, a kind-classifier when all inductive, mixed when both, and general when it has none. The
morpheme-category relations of Table 5.2 are recorded for the rows the monograph assigns; the rows
it does not discuss are `none`, as are `mai` and `tsu`, which have no independent sense. Table 7.2
is the function `pluralMarking` and its regularities are proved by `decide` over the nine cells. The
frequency, breadth, acquisition, anaphoric-distance and construction-distribution counts of Chapters
3, 6 and 8 are corpus statistics and are not represented, nor are the taxonomic analyses of Chapter
4 or the history of Chapter 2.
