# Imel, Guo and Steinert-Threlkeld (2026): An Efficient Communication Analysis of Modal Typology

This file formalizes the efficient-communication model of [imel-guo-steinert-threlkeld-2026].
A modal meaning is a subset of the six-point space `space`, weak and strong force by epistemic,
deontic and circumstantial flavor, and a language is a multiset of meanings. The complexity of
a meaning, Equation (1), is the least number of atoms of a formula of a Boolean Language of
Thought denoting it, computed here from the denotations of formulas with a given number of
atoms (`Formula.dens`, `complexity`). The informativeness of a language, Equations (2) and (3),
is the expected utility of literal communication under a communicative need distribution
(a `MeasureTheory.Measure` on the space): the speaker picks uniformly among the modals
expressing the intended point (`speak`), the listener guesses uniformly among the points of the
modal heard (`ProbabilityTheory.uniformOn`) and earns half credit for each axis guessed right
(`listen`, `informativeness`). Languages are compared by Pareto dominance on complexity and
communicative cost (`Dominates`), and naturalness is the fraction of a vocabulary satisfying
the Independence of Force and Flavor universal of [steinert-threlkeld-imel-guo-2023], the
substrate's `Modality.ForceFlavorIndependent`.

The paper's three results, that every Pareto-optimal system consists of IFF modals, that
naturalness correlates with optimality, and that the attested inventories are more optimal than
the sampled ones, are computational and are not formalized. What is proved are the properties
of the measures the results rest on. Table 2's complexities are recomputed over the experiment's
space, a modal for each point conveys every point exactly (the informativeness is the need of
the space) where a single all-purpose modal earns five twelfths of it, a product meaning's
listener utility depends only on its two axis sizes, and a language with synonyms is dominated
by, and so never Pareto-optimal against, the same language without them.

## Implementation notes

* Table 2 illustrates complexity over a four-flavor space with a teleological flavor the
  library folds into circumstantial. Over the experiment's six-point space *may* is denoted by
  *w ∧ ¬c* and has complexity two, not the table's three, so the table's language has total
  complexity seven rather than eight.
* *may* and St'át'imcets *k'a* are read off the paper's examples (2) and (3), whose rows record
  a force and a flavor each.
* The paper's two counterexamples to the Single Axis of Variability universal, Washo *-eʔ* and
  Koryak *ivək*, are not in its sample of 27 languages. *ivək*'s doxastic and assertive
  flavors ([mocnik-abramovitz-2019]) lie outside the six-point space.
* The probabilistic layer is measure-theoretic: the need distribution is a measure, the
  listener is `ProbabilityTheory.uniformOn` and the speaker a sum of Dirac measures over the
  multiset of applicable modals, so synonyms keep their multiplicity, and the statements are
  `ℝ≥0∞`-valued; `cost` is a truncated subtraction, zero if a non-probability need drove the
  informativeness above one.
