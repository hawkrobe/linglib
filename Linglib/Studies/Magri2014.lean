# Magri (2014): An Account for the Homogeneity Effect Triggered by Plural Definites and Conjunction

This file formalizes the double-strengthening account of homogeneity of [magri-2014]. A plural
definite has the plain existential meaning of the indefinite, and its universal reading is an
implicature of an implicature: the indefinite triggers the *only some* inference, and the definite
triggers the inference that this inference is false, by the iterated exhaustification (19) of
[spector-2007] over the exhaustivity operator (18). The paper's abstract configuration (§5.2) is
three items, the item displaying homogeneity and the weak and strong poles of the scale it patterns
with (`Item`), with a non-transitive Horn-mateness that pairs the item with one pole only. In the
primal theory (52) the item means the weak pole and is a Horn-mate of it (`primal`,
`primalMates`), so the inner exhaustification excludes nothing for the item while the outer one,
denying the strengthened meaning of the weak pole, yields the strong one, (53b)
(`strengthened_primal_mystery_eq_strong`); in a downward-entailing environment the negated meanings
are already strongest and nothing is strengthened, (53a) (`strengthened_primal_not_mystery`). The
dual theory (54), (55) turns this upside down by swapping the poles (`dual`, `dualMates`), and its
computations are the primal ones relabeled (`strengthened_comp_equiv`). In a scenario where the
weak pole holds without the strong both the positive and the negated sentence are false after
strengthening, the homogeneity gap (`primal_gap`, `dual_gap`).

Plural definites and plural morphology instantiate the primal theory with cardinality thresholds
over the extension of the predicate, (32) (`atLeast`, `the_eq_all`), and the same computation in
the non-monotonic scope of *exactly one student* gives universal force in its upward and
existential force in its downward component, (37) (`exactlyOne_the`). Unfocused conjunction
instantiates the dual theory (§5.3), so under negation it behaves as disjunction, (61)
(`not_andUnF_eq_not_or`); with the appendix's enriched alternatives, the atomic conjuncts (69),
the same result comes out of [fox-2007]'s innocent exclusion, (71) and (72)
(`strengthened_not_andUnF`). Questions, which license no strengthening, would tell the theories
apart, (62) and (63), and the paper conjectures (§4) that a matrix definite has universal force
exactly when the indefinite triggers its implicature, which yields the sloppy existential reading
of the classroom example of [gajewski-2005]; neither is modeled.

## Implementation notes

* Meanings are sets of worlds over a finite world type; exhaustification is the substrate's
  innocent exclusion, so the excludable alternatives of (18) are those of the appendix's (70)
  throughout, which agrees with the paper's simpler definition on every computation it performs.
* Each item carries its own Horn-mates, which is how the non-transitivity of (52b), (54b) and
  (69b) is encoded; the prejacent is not among its own alternatives.
* The consistency hypotheses of the general computations, that the weak pole can hold without
  the strong and that the strong pole is satisfiable, are the conditions under which Fox's
  exclusion denies an alternative.

## TODO

* The appendix's computations for conjunction under *exactly one girl*, (74) to (76), need three
  girls for the strengthened meaning to be satisfiable and are not formalized.
