# McKay and van Inwagen (1977): Counterfactuals with Disjunctive Antecedents

This file formalizes the defence in [mckay-vaninwagen-1977] of the variably strict
conditional of [lewis-1973] against simplification of disjunctive antecedents, the inference
from a counterfactual with a disjunctive antecedent to the counterfactual from either
disjunct. Two arguments are stated on the substrate's variably strict conditional. The
bumper-crop argument: the English sentence is false while the disjunctive-closure reading
is true, so the sentence is regimented as the conjunction of the per-disjunct counterfactuals,
which is false as required. The Spain counterexample: *If Spain had fought on the Axis side
or the Allied side, Spain would have fought on the Axis side* is acceptable, yet
simplification would yield the absurd counterfactual from the Allied disjunct.

## Implementation notes

Both readings reduce to `Conditional.variablyStrictImp`, evaluated on the disjunction or
conjoined over the disjuncts, with propositions as sets of worlds of enumerated world types.
Similarity is a ranking of the worlds, so it is total as [lewis-1973]'s comparative similarity
requires, and with finitely many worlds each verdict is computed on the closest
antecedent-worlds (`holds`).

## The Bumper Crop Argument

The critics argue that Lewis's semantics is wrong using the sentence:

  S: "If we were to have good weather this summer or if the sun were to
      grow cold, we would have a bumper crop."

They claim S is equivalent to the regimented counterfactual
S* = (goodWeather ∨ sunCold) > bumperCrop. Since Lewis's semantics
makes S* true (the closest (goodWeather ∨ sunCold)-world has good
weather, hence bumper crop) but S is clearly false, Lewis must be wrong.

McKay & Van Inwagen's rebuttal: premise (2) is false — S is NOT
equivalent to S*. The correct regimentation of S is the conjunction
(goodWeather > bumperCrop) ∧ (sunCold > bumperCrop), which IS false on
Lewis's semantics, matching the English judgment.

## The Spain Example

"Neither. Spain did not enter the war. But if she had fought on one side
or the other, it would have been the Axis."

That is, we assert: (Axis ∨ Allies) > Axis. This is true on Lewis's
semantics (Spain was ideologically closer to the Axis).

But if SDA were valid, it would follow that: Allies > Axis — "If Spain
had fought on the Allied side, Spain would have fought on the Axis side."
This is absurd.
