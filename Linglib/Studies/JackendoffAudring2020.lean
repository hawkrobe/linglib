# Jackendoff and Audring (2020): The Texture of the Lexicon

This file formalizes the Relational Morphology of [jackendoff-audring-2020], in which
morphological motivation is shared structure recorded by nondirectional relational links
between fully specified lexical entries, not inheritance from an abstract base. The
mixed-direction pairs of Objection 10 to inheritance, Section 3.4.4, are the test: *assassin*
and *assassinate* build the second on the first in phonology and the first on the second in
semantics, so no acyclic inheritance hierarchy holds both demands (`assassin_cycle`), though
default inheritance itself computes as the taxonomy of Figure 3.5 intends
(`ostrich_overrides`), while a
sister link with a coindex per shared part carries both, (41) (`assassin_pairs`), and reads the
same transposed (`assassin_pairs_symm`). Bumped up a level, Section 4.8.2, the link between the
*-ism* and *-ist* schemas, (47), pairs every ideology's noun with its adherent's, whatever the
base and the ideology (`ismist_pairs`), the open-ended relation the book illustrates with
*Trumpism*. Ablaut, Section 5.3, is a sister link off the syllabic nucleus: the general schema
(25) pairs exactly the stems and pasts that are the same except at the nucleus
(`ablaut_pairs_iff`), the *sing*/*sang* subschema (26) is a special case of it
(`ablaut_pairs_of_nucleusPair`) whose pairs are nucleus contrasts
(`contrast_of_nucleusPair`), and the German present-tense schema (45) has the same
phonological shape. The cells (45) serves, the second and third singular present, are a
morphome, Section 5.4.4: the syncretism class of the special stem of *sprechen* is a value
conjunction of no feature of the paradigm (`spricht_morphome`). The Same Verb Problem, Section
5.6, is a shared morphosyntax-phonology pivot without a shared semantics: two lexemes selecting
the same pivot inflect alike at every cell (`realize_eq_of_sameVerb`), which pairs the two
*draw*s of (60) and *take* with *take part*, (57) to (59), and separates the homophones *ring*
and *wring*. Structural Intersection, Section 7.8.1, is the meet: the schema (6) is the
intersection of its three sisters (5) (`ishSchema_body_eq_inf`), is the most they have in
common (`instantiates_ishSchema_iff`), and absorbs a newly encountered sister
(`ishSchema_inf_foolish`).

## Implementation notes

* Lexical entries and schemas are slot-indexed descriptions over a flat carrier, a constant
  above `⊥` and a variable at `⊥`; a relational coindex is a variable subscripting a slot of
  each entry, which a paired instantiation fills alike
  (`ConstructionMorphology.Schema.InstantiatesAt`). The containment of
  the semantics of *assassinate* in that of *assassin*, (41), is rendered as a shared slot.
* The zero exponence of the present and the infinitive of *walk*, (19), the double
  coindexation of Section 4.3, appears as a syncretism of the paradigm (`walk_syncretism`).
* The cycle theorem renders the paradox of Objection 10 through the well-foundedness of an
  inheritance hierarchy; the book argues from the above-and-below paradox and makes no
  well-foundedness claim.
* The syllables and the *-ish* adjectives are the CLDF forms of
  `Data/Forms/JackendoffAudring2020.json`, read as slot-indexed segments by
  `Data.Forms.Form.slots`; a syllable's positions are onset, nucleus and coda.
* The correspondence between a schema's variable coindices and the constant coindices of its
  instances, left unformalized in Section 4.13.2, is the subscripting of
  `ConstructionMorphology.Schema.InstantiatesAt`; a productive variable is one marked open
  over and above its attested fillers.
