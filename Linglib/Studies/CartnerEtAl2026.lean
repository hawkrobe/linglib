# Cartner et al. 2026: subject islands do not reduce to discourse function

This file formalizes the argument of [cartner-et-al-2026] against information-structural accounts
of the subject island. On the Focus Background Constraint of [abeille-et-al-2020] a subject island
is a clash between a focused filler and a backgrounded extraction domain, so the effect should
appear where the filler is focused and not otherwise: in wh-questions but not in relative clauses
or topicalization, whose fillers are not focused. Three factorial acceptability experiments
([sprouse-2007], [sprouse-et-al-2012]) find the effect in all three constructions and at
comparable magnitude, which no reading of the constraint accommodates. The constraint compares
the filler and the extraction domain on one scale, a backgrounded constituent being an unfocused
one, so both statuses are a `Focus.Mark`. Its gradient statement, (44) of [abeille-et-al-2020],
makes focus monotone along containment: the more focused an element, the more focused the
constituent it is part of. The revision of [winckel-et-al-2025], the paper's (11), states it as
the strict inequality, an extracted element being no more focused than its governor
(`FBCPredictsIsland`), and on binary marks the categorical constraint, the paper's (10), is that
inequality (`fbcViolation_iff_lt`).

The design holds the extraction domain constant and varies the filler, so it bears only on
accounts that read the filler. An account whose prediction is a function of the domain alone —
direct backgroundedness ([cuneo-goldberg-2023]), or a structural constraint on the configuration —
predicts the same verdict in every construction and is untouched by the result, as the paper notes
(§8). Direct backgroundedness is not the constraint with a different filler: its foregrounded
constituents include topics, which the Focus Background Constraint counts as backgrounded, and
it assumes that every filler-gap construction foregrounds a constituent (p. 4), so it reads the
domain alone.

## Main definitions

* `FGDConstruction`, `fillerFocus`, `subjectFocus` — the three constructions, the filler's focus,
  which the design manipulates, and the subject's, which it holds fixed
* `FBCViolation` — the categorical constraint (10)
* `FBCPredictsIsland` — the constraint's prediction, the filler more focused than the subject

## Main results

* `fbcViolation_iff_lt` — on binary marks the categorical constraint is the strict inequality
* `fbc_predicts_construction_dependence` — the constraint makes the effect turn on construction
* `fbc_falsified` — an effect in relative clauses refutes it, in either formulation
* `domain_only_predicts_invariance` — an account reading only the domain predicts invariance, so
  the experiments leave it standing

mechanism and differ in the information-structural status of the filler. -/

backgrounded in the discourse (§2), and relativization assigns its head no focus
([abeille-et-al-2020]). -/

  (IsSimpleOrder.lt_iff_eq_bot_and_eq_top.trans and_comm).symm

/-- The constraint's prediction for a construction: the filler is strictly more focused than the

/-! ### What the experiments show

All three experiments find a super-additive penalty for sub-extraction from a subject, and the
cross-constructional analysis puts the three penalties at comparable magnitude with overlapping
95% HPDIs (§7). Taking `Island` to be the effect's distribution over constructions, the finding is
that it holds of a construction whose filler is not focused. -/

/-- An island effect in relative clauses refutes the Focus Background Constraint, in either
formulation (`fbcPredictsIsland_iff`), which ties the effect to a focused filler. -/
theorem fbc_falsified (Island : FGDConstruction → Prop)
    (hfbc : ∀ c, Island c ↔ FBCPredictsIsland c) (h : Island .relativeClause) : False :=
  fbc_predicts_construction_dependence.2.1 ((hfbc _).1 h)

/-- The limit of the result. An account whose prediction reads only the extraction domain gives
the same verdict in every construction, since the design holds the domain fixed — so
construction-invariant effects are what it predicts, and the experiments do not bear on it. -/
theorem domain_only_predicts_invariance (P : Mark → Prop) (c c' : FGDConstruction) :
    P (subjectFocus c) ↔ P (subjectFocus c') := Iff.rfl
