# Hudson (2010): An Introduction to Word Grammar

This file formalizes the worked examples of Part I of [hudson-2010] on the default-inheritance
substrate `DefaultInheritance`. Default inheritance is the book's engine. An exemplar inherits every
property of the concepts above it in the isA taxonomy except those overridden lower down. So a
penguin exemplar inherits *lays eggs* from *bird* but *doesn't fly* from *penguin* (Figure 2.8,
`inherited_flight_e2`), and a diesel car exemplar runs on diesel rather than the default petrol
(Figure 3.18, `inherited_fuel_e`). The book's searcher climbs the taxonomy from the exemplar and
keeps the first answer it finds (Section 2.5.3). The substrate proves that this answer is an
inherited one for every climb that starts at the bottom
(`DefaultInheritance.mem_inherited_of_find?_eq_some`). Multiple inheritance can leave a conflict
with no recognized resolution, the Nixon diamond of Figure 2.7. Nixon inherits both *accepts war*
and *rejects war* as credulous conclusions and neither as a skeptical one (`inherited_war_nixon`,
`not_entails_war_nixon`), and the two climbs that visit his parents in opposite orders find
different answers (`search_war_nixon`). Nixon's own choice, a copy of *accepts war* at his node,
settles the conflict (`nixon_resolved`). Choice sets keep such conflicts from arising. No one is
both male and female, or both adult and child, so a property attached to the members of either
choice set is never inherited twice, although *man*, *boy*, *woman* and *girl* each inherit from two
concepts (Figure 3.9, `subsingleton_inherited_sex`, `subsingleton_inherited_age`).

Relational concepts are defined in terms of existing ones: *parent* merges *mother* and
*father*, *grandmother* is the mother of a parent, and *ancestor* is the recursive closure of
*parent* (Section 3.2.7, `ancestor`). The definition of *grandmother* is a relational
`Triangle`, one node's two relations converging on a third, and the same triangle is the
syntactic pattern of raising: an auxiliary's subject is also its valent's subject
(Figure 7.6). Closing the asserted subjects under the triangle along the valent chain
(`raise`) makes *he* the subject of every verb in *He keeps seeming to have forgotten to go*
(Figure 7.12, `he_subject_of_go`).

## Implementation notes

* A property is an attribute, a partial map from concepts to values, and two values compete when
  they are values of one attribute. The book's competition between links one of which isA the
  other (Section 3.5.3) is not modelled.
* Only exemplars inherit (Section 2.5). `DefaultInheritance.inherited` is defined at every
  concept, and the theorems query the exemplars.
* Each taxonomy is declared by its immediate isA links, and its order is their reflexive
  transitive closure (`partialOrderOfCovers`).
* The kinship system of Figure 8.16 is built from `mother` and `father` on an arbitrary type
  of people, with sex as predicates; the compositions are mathlib's `Relation.Comp` and
  `Relation.TransGen`.
