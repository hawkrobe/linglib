# Gisborne (2026): Mutual dependency, English wh-clauses and Word Grammar

This file formalizes Gisborne's account of word order under mutual dependency in Word Grammar.
Word order is fixed by landmarks, which must form a projective tree as in Robinson's axioms, and
we compare Hudson's earlier and later theories of landmarks with Gisborne's revision, in which an
extracted word is placed by a positional head outside the landmark tree.

## Main definitions

* `Analysis n`: a Word Grammar analysis of `n` words, a network of typed dependencies in which a
  word may have several heads and two words may depend on each other.
* `Analysis.IsLandmark A w p`: `p` is the landmark of `w` by Hudson's 2007 rules, under which a
  head is a landmark unless it is subordinate to another head.
* `Analysis.Orders A L root`: the landmark relation `L` forms a projective tree from `root`, with
  every word on its side of its landmark.
* `Analysis.OrderedByLandmarks A`, `Analysis.OrderedByChosenLandmarks A`,
  `Analysis.OrderedByPositionalHeads A`: `A` is ordered by the 2007 theory, by landmarks chosen as
  in the 2018 theory, and by the revision.

## Main statements

* `Analysis.isLandmark_iff`: the 2007 rules, stated as default inheritance, make `p` the landmark
  of `w` exactly when `p` is a head of `w` not subordinate to another of its heads.
* `Analysis.not_orderedByLandmarks_of_extraction`: an analysis is not ordered by the 2007 theory
  when a word is extracted from a head that it heads and has another head as well.
* `Analysis.OrderedByLandmarks.orderedByPositionalHeads`: the revision orders every analysis the
  2007 theory orders.
* `orderedByPositionalHeads_whatHeBoughtCostLots`, `not_orderedByLandmarks_whatHeBoughtCostLots`:
  the revision orders the free relative *What he bought cost lots*, and the 2007 theory does not.

## Implementation notes

* The landmark rules are a `DefaultInheritance` network over the concepts *parent* and
  *subordinate parent*, and a landmark relation is checked for `IsTree` and `IsProjective` as a
  `DependencyGrammar.Graph` with UD's `dep` on each arc.
* Each dependency type fixes the side of its head that its dependent stands on (`Rel.dir`), and an
  extractee's side overrides an object's.
* Chosen landmarks range over each word's heads; the Best Landmark Principle's preference for the
  nearest more prominent word is not modelled.

## TODO

* The distributional evidence that free relatives are headed by their wh word and dependent
  interrogatives by their verb.
