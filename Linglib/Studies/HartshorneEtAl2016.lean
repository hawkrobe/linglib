# Hartshorne et al. (2016): Psych verbs, the linking problem, and the acquisition of language

This file formalizes [hartshorne-etal-2016]'s resolution of the psych-verb linking problem.
Fear-type verbs (*Agnes feared Bartholomew*) and frighten-type verbs (*Bartholomew frightened
Agnes*) describe the same emotions with reversed linking, the strongest apparent case against
systematic mappings from meaning to form. The paper's proposal is that they lexicalize two
conceptualizations of emotion, a habitual attitude of an experiencer directed at a target and an
episode in which a stimulus causes an experiencer to be in an emotional state, and nine
experiments show the distinction to be systematic (fear-type states are rated longer-lasting and
the subject of a frighten-type verb is judged causally responsible, in Mandarin and Korean as in
English), productive (adults in English, Japanese and Russian give novel verbs with attitude
meanings experiencer-subject syntax and those with episode meanings experiencer-object syntax)
and early (four- and five-year-olds do the same). The linking itself follows from one principle
over the semantic structures of Fig. 11, prominence preservation: `Sem.subject` is the
least embedded argument of such a structure, and since the causer of CAUSE and the holder of BE
are highest whatever they embed (`subject_cause`), the experiencer heads the attitude and the
stimulus the episode (`attitude_subject`, `episode_subject`), while the causation judgments
answer to whether the structure contains CAUSE at all. The linking agrees with
[belletti-rizzi-1988]'s Class I and Class II as recorded in `Pesetsky1995` and with
[levin-1993]'s admire and amuse classes (`agrees_with_levin`).

## Implementation notes

The structures follow the prose of §5.4.1 rather than the figures: BE takes the entity in
a state and the state, the state of an attitude is the root directed at a target, and CAUSE takes
the causer and the caused BE, with no BECOME. Duration is not encoded in the structures, and the
experiments' rates stay in prose: fear-type verbs were rated longer-lasting than frighten-type
verbs, with 42 percent of the former above every one of the latter; causal responsibility fell on
the subject for 214 of 216 frighten-type verbs and on no consistent participant for fear-type
verbs; and frighten-type syntax was chosen for novel episode verbs over novel attitude verbs by
adults (68 against 38 percent in English) and by children (66 against 33 percent at ages four to
five). The paper's examples are the rows of `Data/Examples/HartshorneEtAl2016.json`.

## TODO

* §5.4.3: the Fig. 11 structures admit a target in the episode (`episodeWithTarget`),
  predicting the unattested (7); the mental-possession alternative that would exclude it.
