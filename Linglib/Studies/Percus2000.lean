# Percus (2000): Constraints on Some Other Variables in Syntax

This file formalizes the situation-pronoun syntax of [percus-2000]. Every predicate carries a
situation pronoun, every clause introduces an indexed λ binding situations, and two
generalizations restrict which λ a pronoun may take: Generalization X (34), that the situation
pronoun a verb selects for is coindexed with the nearest λ above it, and Generalization Y
(39), that the situation pronoun an adverbial quantifier selects for is likewise locally
bound, whereas the pronoun inside a determiner phrase may be bound from higher up (`LF.GenX`,
`QLF.GenY`). For *Mary thinks that my brother is Canadian* (26a) this admits the indexing
(27), *my brother* transparent and *is Canadian* opaque, and excludes the indexing (33),
*my brother* opaque and *is Canadian* transparent. The paper's two scenarios are two models:
where Mary takes Allon, the speaker's brother, not to be the brother but to be Canadian, the
sentence is judged true, and only the licensed transparent-phrase indexing makes it so
(`scenario_allon`); where Mary takes Pierre, a Canadian, to be the brother and so to be
American, the sentence is judged false, and the one indexing that would make it true is the
excluded one (`scenario_pierre`). For *Mary thinks that my brother always won the game*
(35a), binding the quantifier's pronoun to the matrix λ, the indexing (37), would make the
sentence true when Mary is unaware of the games Pierre won, where it is judged false, and
binding it to the embedded λ, the indexing (38), makes it true when Mary is deluded about
games Pierre lost, where it is judged true (`scenario_unaware`, `scenario_deluded`).

## Implementation notes

Situation assignments specialize the assignments of `Logic/Assignment` to indices of world
and time, the λ-binding of situation pronouns being the predicate abstraction of
[heim-kratzer-1998]; the models have two worlds, with a trivial time coordinate for (26a)
and the rounds of the game for (35a). The coindexing of both embedded pronouns with the
matrix λ is ruled out independently of the generalizations (fn. 18), and the motivation of
Generalization X from counterfactuals (40) is not formalized.
