# Chomsky (2013): Problems of projection

[chomsky-2013] replaces projection by a labeling algorithm, minimal search for the head of a
syntactic object (`Minimalist.SyntacticObject.label`). A head merged with a phrase labels the
result; two phrases do not, unless one of them raises, its lower copy being invisible to the
search, or their heads share an agreed feature. Raising for labeling reinterprets [moro-2000]'s
dynamic antisymmetry: the small clause of a copular sentence (18) is two phrases and is labeled
only once one of them raises, and the verb phrase with its external argument (17) is labeled
`v` only once that argument raises out of it, which forces the EPP. The intermediate landing
sites of successive-cyclic movement are the most general case: a wh-phrase in the specifier of
an embedded declarative CP leaves it unlabeled, barring (21), and moving on leaves its lower copy,
so the CP is labeled and the verb above selects it.

## Implementation notes

* A clause is represented before its surface subject is merged, `{T, XP}`, labeled `T`: the
  paper argues that the C–T relation is established at that point, before the subject is
  introduced (the discussion of (16)–(17)). The subject and its sister are two phrases, labeled
  by the φ-features they share, which is not formalized.
* The wh-phrase of (21) is an adjunct; its base position is left out.

## TODO

The labeling of the indirect question (22) by the interrogative feature its two phrases share,
and of the case of (17) where the internal argument raises and the external argument stays,
labeled `v` because only the external argument and the raised verb are visible, need Agree and
head movement.
