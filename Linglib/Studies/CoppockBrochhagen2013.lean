# Coppock and Brochhagen (2013): Raising and resolving issues with scalar modifiers

Coppock and Brochhagen analyse *at least* and *at most* as quantifying over a scale of answers to
the question under discussion: *at least p* is what *only p* presupposes, that some true answer is
at least as strong as `p`, and *at most p* is what *only p* asserts, that no true answer is
stronger. These are `Focus.Particles.atLeast` and `Focus.Particles.atMost`, modifiers of
propositions. On the question of how many, with answers ranked by number, they give the truth
conditions of the modified numerals whether the bare numeral is read two-sidedly or one-sidedly,
and on a scale of mutually exclusive answers, such as academic ranks, *at least* widens its
prejacent.

To explain why superlative modifiers carry ignorance implicatures and no scalar implicatures, the
authors move to unrestricted inquisitive semantics, where *at least p* raises every answer at least
as strong as `p` as a possibility. A speaker who knows the answer cannot sincerely raise several
possibilities, while the comparative *more than* raises one, and exhaustifying the raised
possibilities does not exclude the stronger answers.

## Main statements

* `atLeast_fragment`, `atMost_fragment`: on the question of how many, *at least* and *at most*
  are the Fragment's readings of the modified numerals, pulled back along the count.
* `sUnion_atLeastInq`, `sUnion_atMostInq`: the inquisitive entries keep the truth conditions.
* `restrict_atLeastInq_eq_singleton`: a speaker who knows the answer cannot raise the
  possibilities of *at least*, the ignorance implicature.

## Implementation notes

* A state is a relation on propositions, and the question of a measure `μ` has the answers
  `μ ⁻¹' {i}` (two-sided) or `μ ⁻¹' Ici i` (one-sided), ranked by `i`; the paper's assumption of one
  world for each number is surjectivity of `μ`.
* The choice-function entries (53), (54) and (60) are modelled by the sets of possibilities they
  denote, which is what applying them pointwise yields (`range_choice_apply`).
* The informational content of inquisitive *at most* is `max` within the common ground of the
  state, the union of its answers.

## TODO

The interaction with modals is not formalized: the authoritative and speaker-insecurity readings
of *at least* under deontic modals (§3.5) and the missing readings of *at most* under *may*, which
the paper derives with Hackl's *-many* (§3.6).
