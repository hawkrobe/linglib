# Hofmeister and Sag (2010): Cognitive Constraints and Island Effects

This file formalizes Hofmeister and Sag's processing account of island effects. The paper traces
island effects to four factors, namely the length of the filler–gap dependency, the referential
load of the material it spans, the clause boundaries it crosses, and the complexity of the
filler. Each factor is read off a `Stimulus`, the filler with the words between it and the gap,
and stimuli are compared by Pareto dominance over the four factors (`Stimulus.profile`).

Dominance predicts the paper's contrasts. Whatever the dependency, a which-N filler is easier
than a bare one (`which_easier`), the complex-NP island of Experiment 1 is harder than its
baseline even with the richer filler (`cnpc_harder_than_baseline`), and the which-N wh-island of
Experiment 2 is incomparable with its bare baseline (`whIsland_which_incomparable`), where the
experiment found no reading-time difference after the embedded verb.

## Implementation notes

* Each factor is ordinal. A word's referential load follows the accessibility scale of §3.2,
  with pronouns below indefinites below definites and names, a clause boundary's cost follows
  §3.3, with a declarative complement below an interrogative one, a filler's ease is its
  complexity, and the dependency's length counts the words it spans.
* Pareto dominance is the product order on `ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕᵒᵈ`, with ease reversed because more
  ease makes processing easier. No rating or reading time enters a theorem, and the paper's
  acceptability and reading-time results stay in prose.
* The NP-type factor of Experiment 1 was weak and local in reading times and not significant in
  acceptability, so the profiles predict its direction (`cnpc_definite_harder`), not a size.

reference of some accessibility, a clause boundary of some kind, or other material. -/

Pareto dominance, so one stimulus is harder than another only when it is at least as hard on
every factor and strictly harder on one. -/
