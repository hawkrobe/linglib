# Iatridou and Zeijlstra (2021): The Complex Beauty of Boundary Adverbials

Iatridou and Zeijlstra analyze *in years* and *until* as boundary adverbials that are domain
wideners. *In years* introduces the subintervals of the perfect time span as domain alternatives,
which exhaustification turns into a contradiction for the positive perfective claim and leaves
vacuous under negation, so it is a negative polarity item. As a domain widener it stretches its
left boundary as far as is logically possible, to the greatest event-free span, which forces an
event just beyond that boundary, the noncancelable actuality inference, and makes the span
contain every event-free alternative, the beyond expectation inference. *Until* is the mirror
image with the left boundary fixed: with an imperfective predicate exhaustification is vacuous,
and with a perfective one only the construal exhaustifying the negated claim survives, so the
punctual and durative *until*s of Karttunen and Giannakidou are one word. Against their ambiguity
account, negation yields the subinterval property, so its durative *until* would accept a negated
perfective with no event at all, and Greek *para mono* is an exceptive whose meaning already
gives the punctual one.

## Main statements

* `in_years_contradictory`: exhaustified, the positive perfective claim is contradictory when
  the events are shorter than the span.
* `negated_perfective_exh_vacuous`, `throughout_exh_vacuous`: exhaustification is vacuous for a
  negated perfective and for a predicate holding throughout the span.
* `not_throughout_exh_contradictory`: exhaustifying the claim that an imperfective predicate does
  not hold throughout the span is contradictory.
* `actuality_inference`, `event_near_lb`, `event_near_rb`: a widened span forces a relevant event
  just beyond its widened boundary.
* `beyond_expectation_inference`: the widened span contains every event-free alternative.
* `widened_iff_maximal`: the widened span is the event-free span stretched until the sentence
  would become false.
* `not_widened_rb_of_finite`: in dense time no span is widened past finitely many events.
* `two_until_overgenerates`: the durative *until* of the ambiguity account accepts a negated
  perfective with no event at all.
* `eventiveUntil_of_exceptive`: *para mono* with a temporal argument under negation, read as an
  exceptive, entails the punctual *until* meaning, the event included.
* `isLeast_rightBoundaries_prfv`, `isLeast_rightBoundaries_unbounded`: a perfective argument of
  *until* sets the right boundary at the completion of its event, an imperfective one at the
  onset.

## Implementation notes

* Exhaustification is the shared `Exhaustification.exh` over the domain alternatives, the claim
  at every subinterval. Entailment between the alternatives is logical, inclusion between sets of
  interpretations of the event predicate: a claim is stated for `P : V → E → Prop` reaching every
  extension (`Function.Surjective P`), the extensions themselves (`P = id`, `V = E → Prop`) or
  their negations (`surjective_not`). A predicate at a world is its extension, `τ ∈ PRFV P w` being
  `PRFV id (P w) τ` by definition. Refuting an entailment assumes the event domain rich, every
  interval the run time of some event (`Function.Surjective Event.τ`).
* The paper calls the exhaustified positive claim a logical contradiction. It needs the events to
  be shorter than the span, as Chierchia's culminated event inside a period of weeks is; an event
  filling the span exactly survives exhaustification (`mem_exh_prfv_iff`). The contradiction for
  the not-throughout claim, (142), needs overlapping events to sum and an interior point of the
  span.
* The widened span is `IsGreatest` among the event-free spans with the fixed boundary, its other
  boundary the right one set by tense for *in years* and the contextual left one for *until*.
  With closed spans and inclusion the forced event lies strictly beyond the widened boundary, and
  in dense time such a span exists only past infinitely many events; the paper puts "issues of
  density aside".
* The paper's meaning for *para mono*, after von Fintel and Iatridou, is an existential that does
  not itself entail the exception; for the entailment it appeals to "one's favorite semantics" of
  exceptives. Von Fintel's least-exception semantics, `Quantifier.Exceptive`, supplies it.
* The paper's summary of the three scopal construals in Section 7.2 has the labels of the first
  two interchanged relative to (146) and (148), and Section 8 once attaches throughout-not and
  not-throughout to (148c2) and (148c1), the reverse of (148); the theorems follow (146) and
  (148).

## TODO

* Section 8's fact that *in*-adverbials lack the universal perfect, (153), on which the
  exclusion of (154c1–2) rests, is taken as given by the paper and not derived.
* The satisfaction of the actuality inference on a future branch, (155)–(162), and the hypothesis
  that a presupposed span makes a domain widener a strong polarity item, after Gajewski's account
  of strong items by enriched meanings, are not formalized.

/-! ### *In years*: the perfective claim and its negation

The assertion of a perfect of the perfective, (14e) and (49a), is `Aspect.PRFV`: some event's
run time lies inside the span. Its domain alternatives are stronger and not entailed, so
exhaustification negates them all and the event would have to fill the span, which a culminated
event shorter than weeks cannot, (44) and (49). The negated perfective has the subinterval
property (`Aspect.isLowerSet_compl_prfv`), so under negation every alternative is
entailed and exhaustification is vacuous, (50). With *until* the same holds of the until time
span: the positive perfective (128)–(132) is contradictory, and so is (146a), exhaustifying the
perfective of the negated predicate, while the construal exhaustifying the negated claim, (148b),
is vacuous. -/

/-! ### Domain widening: the actuality and beyond expectation inferences

A boundary adverbial sets one boundary of its span, while tense or the argument of *until* fixes
the other (`F`, the spans ending at `t` for *in years* and those starting at `t` for *until*). A
domain widener stretches its boundary as far as is logically possible: its span is the greatest
event-free span with the fixed boundary, Section 4. The event that stops the widening is the
actuality inference, Constant's observation, and the span's containing every event-free
alternative is the beyond expectation inference. A boundary adverbial that names its own
boundary, *in (the last) 5 years* or *since 2015*, leaves the actuality inference cancelable and
has no beyond expectation inference. -/

The predicate holds throughout the until time span, (137): `Aspect.UNBOUNDED`, the span inside
the event's run time. Every domain alternative is then entailed and exhaustification is vacuous,
for the affirmative (148a) as for the throughout-not reading with the negated event predicate,
(139) and (148c1), and the not-throughout reading with negation above the exhaustifier, (148c2).
The remaining construal, exhaustifying the not-throughout claim (148b), makes the predicate hold
throughout every proper subinterval, (142), which is contradictory once overlapping events
sum. -/

/-! ### Against the lexical ambiguity of *until*

The ambiguity account must deny that negation yields the subinterval property, Section 5.2.2:
otherwise its durative *until* takes a negated perfective on the throughout-not reading, which has
no actuality inference, and *She did not leave until 5 p.m. and maybe she didn't leave at all*,
(83), would not be a contradiction. Greek, Section 5.2.1.1, offers no separate punctual *until*:
*para mono* is the exceptive 'but only', and *Dhen thimose para mono htes* 'he didn't get angry
except yesterday', (69), means what the punctual *until* is said to mean. -/

/-! ### Setting the right boundary

The argument of *until* contains a definite description over intervals, which picks the
maximally informative interval as von Fintel, Fox and Iatridou have definites do, so the right
boundary is the first moment at which the argument clause holds of a span ending there. A
perfective argument, *until she read Anna Karenina*, (170)–(171), sets it at the completion of
the reading, an imperfective one, *until she was working at the grocery store*, (172)–(175), at
the onset. -/
