# Haspelmath (2021): Bound forms, welded forms, and affixes: Basic concepts for morphological comparison

Haspelmath defines an affix as a bound morph that is not a root, that must occur on a root, and
that cannot occur on roots of different root classes, where a bound form occurs on a root when
it is next to the root or next to an affix that occurs on the root. Roots are the morphs
denoting a thing, an action or a property. The definition is `Morphology.Comparative.IsAffixIn`
with the contentful morphs as roots. This file checks it against the paper's examples and shows
what its recursion needs: the inductive reading misses affixes that occur only next to other
affixes, and when markers separate roots the definition can have two incompatible solutions.

## Main results

* `latin_affixes`: Latin *-bi*, *-v*, *-s* and *-isti* are affixes, *-s* and *-isti* only
  through *-bi* and *-v*.
* `turkish_affixes`: Turkish *mu* is not an affix, so neither is *-sun*, written as a suffix,
  while *-iyor* is.
* `polish_scie_not_affix`, `english_article_not_affix`, `russian_li_not_affix`: bound forms on
  roots of two classes are not affixes.
* `italian_object_affixes`: the Italian object person forms are affixes on either side of the
  verb, though the Italian fragment records *mi* as a clitic.
* `variableOrder_affixes`: with two suffixes in either order, the least solution has no affix
  and the greatest has both.
* `separated_affixes`: when two markers separate two roots, each marker is an affix in some
  solution but no solution has both.
* `suffixBeforeRoot_not_affix`: occurrence on a root is adjacency on either side, so a suffix
  followed by a root of another class is not an affix.

## Implementation notes

Each example is an inventory of the paper's free forms, each a list of morphs with textbook
attachment labels, together with the classes of its roots. The paper's segmentations are kept,
so Polish *domu* and *zrobili* are single morphs. The welded forms of §5 are not formalized.
