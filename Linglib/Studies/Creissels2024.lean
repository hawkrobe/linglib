# Creissels (2024): Transitivity, Valency, and Voice

A valency alternation relates two constructions of one verb, which express its participants as
nominal terms with the transitivity-related roles A, P, S or X, as dative obliques, as implied
participants, or not at all. Marked by verbal morphology it is a voice alternation, and the
oriented types are defined by nucleativization, a participant becoming a core term, and
denucleativization, a core term ceasing to be one, by demotion within participant structure or
by suppression from it. Symmetrical voices select a pivot without either and fall outside the
typology. Alignment is reformulated as obligatory A-coding or P-coding, which split-S languages
violate.

## Main statements

* `rows_classified`: every derived construction of the book's examples realizes the type the
  book assigns it.
* `voices_typed`: the substrate's voices realize the types they are named for.
* `stacking_tswana`, `stacking_nahuatl`: stacked voice markers compose their alternations.

## Implementation notes

* An alternation is a pair of `Voice.Construction`s, a type a predicate on the pair with the
  participant the type singles out as a parameter. The semantic conditions that separate
  causativization from the other A/S-nucleativizations, or reflexivization from
  reciprocalization, are not modelled; the rows carry the book's label.
* Passivization also keeps the initial P nuclear, which footnote 1 of §8.1.3 states beside the
  three defining features of §8.3.2.1.
* Frames record no dative oblique and no concernee, so D-applicativization and
  concernativization have examples but no voice.
* The Obligatory Coding Principle is stated over the flags of S in the book's intransitive
  examples; the book's principle ranges over every verb's coding frame.

## TODO

* Chapters 2 to 7, and chapters 9 to 17 beyond their definitions, are not modelled.
* The potential-participant condition on nucleativization (§8.1.6), the non-compositional
  readings of stacked markers (§8.4.3) and the diachronic scenarios are prose.
* `Voice.impersonalPassive` is the passive with no pivot: its frames code the initial P as S,
  so its derived construction is not impersonal and it is missing from `voiceTypes`.
