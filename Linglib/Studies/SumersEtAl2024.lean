# Sumers, Ho, Griffiths, and Hawkins (2024): Reconciling Truthfulness and Relevance as Epistemic and Decision-Theoretic Utility

This file formalizes [sumers-etal-2024]'s speaker model, on which the Gricean maxims of quality
and relation ([grice-1975]) are two independent objectives a speaker trades off. Truthfulness
is an epistemic utility, `1` for a true utterance and `-1` for a false one (5),
`truthfulness`; relevance is a decision-theoretic utility, the reward the listener earns by
acting on the utterance in a decision problem ([van-rooy-2003], [benz-2006]) (6)–(8), the
substrate's `RSA.actionUtility` of `RSA.policy`; and the speaker of a Rational Speech Act
model ([frank-goodman-2012]) soft-maximizes their convex combination at a weight `λ` plus a
cost term (9), `combinedUtility`, `speaker`. The endpoints are the purely truthful speaker, who
is insensitive to the decision problem and uniform over the true utterances,
`speaker_zero_eq_of_mem`, and the purely relevant speaker, who exaggerates whenever
exaggeration earns the listener more, `speaker_one_real_lt_iff`.

Signaling bandits decouple the two objectives. A world assigns a value to each feature, an
action carries a set of features, and its reward is the sum of their values (10)–(11),
`reward`; an utterance names a feature and its value, true at a world regardless of the
decision context, `sem`; the listener conditions a uniform prior on the utterance and acts on
the expected rewards of the actions in the context. Under the uniform prior the posterior
mean of the named feature is the named value and every other feature keeps its prior mean,
`expectedReward_uniformListener_filter`, which is how the paper reads Figure 6C: in the
context of a red spotted, a red solid, and a blue striped mushroom, naming the value of green
or the zero value of red is true but leaves the listener's policy where the prior had it,
`green_two_true_irrelevant`, `red_zero_true_irrelevant`; naming a positive value of spots is
relevant, and the more so the higher the value, so the exaggeration is false but more relevant
than the truth, `spots_relevant_iff`, `exaggeration_relevant`; and the combined speaker prefers
the true utterance exactly when the relevance gained by exaggerating is worth less than the
truthfulness lost, `prefers_truth_iff`. Relevance is context-dependent where truth is not: in
a context of three spotted mushrooms naming the value of spots is irrelevant and naming the
value of green is relevant (footnote 12), `spots_irrelevant_allSpotted`,
`green_relevant_allSpotted`.

Appendix A relates decision problems to questions under discussion ([roberts-2012]). For the
two-action decision problem in which one action earns `r` in a cell of the partition
containing the true world and `s` outside it, and the other the reverse, relevance is a
logistic function of the listener's posterior mass on the cell, `actionUtility_cellReward`,
so for `s < r` it ranks utterances exactly as the question's epistemic utility, the log of
that mass, does, `actionUtility_lt_iff_qudUtility_lt`; the identity decision problem of
Theorem 1 is the case of the singleton cell, `actionUtility_lt_iff_log_lt`.

The paper's two experiments put participants in the speaker's role in the mushroom domain.
In the free-choice experiment participants instructed to be truthful, given no instruction,
or instructed to make the tourist pick well were fit by increasing weights on relevance, the
uninstructed participants strictly between the endpoints; in the endorsement experiment the
separation widened and the uninstructed participants still balanced the two; and the combined
model was favored over either objective alone. The worked examples, on which a pragmatic
listener embedding the combined speaker infers that a mentioned garage is open, loosens a
stated start time, and rounds the time when asked casually ([van-der-henst-etal-2002]), are
simulations at chosen parameters and are not formalized.

## Implementation notes

The listener's decision context is the action type, so a context of the bandit is a type of
actions with their feature sets, and an utterance's relevance in two contexts is its utility
against two action types. The cost term enters with the sign of (9). Lewis signaling games,
where the world state is the correct action and the objectives coincide, are described and
not formalized.

## TODO

* Theorem 1's exact identity: the reward `s` at which relevance under the identity decision
  problem equals the log of the posterior mass, defined through the Lambert W function.
