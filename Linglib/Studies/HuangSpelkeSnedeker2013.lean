# Huang, Spelke and Snedeker (2013): What exactly do numbers mean?

Huang, Spelke and Snedeker ask whether number words have exact or lower-bounded semantics by
cancelling the scalar implicature that would otherwise supply the upper bound. A trial shows two
visible boxes and a covered one, and the instruction is a definite description such as *the box
with two fish*. Its referent under a reading of the term is the visible box satisfying it when
exactly one does, the covered box when none does, and no box when both do (`choice`). Adults and
two- to three-year-olds took the total set for *some* and the covered box for *two*.

Two-knowers, children who give one and two but a handful for larger numerals in Wynn's Give-N
task, are the population for which the lower-bounded account has no implicature to offer, the
developmental strategy of Musolino.

## Main results

* `choice_exact_covered`, `choice_atLeast_visible`: in the critical trials an exact *two* sends
  the participant to the covered box and a lower-bounded *two* to the visible one.
* `some_none_all_literal`, `some_none_all_strengthened`: literal *some* picks the box where
  Cookie Monster has all of the cookies, strengthened *some* the covered box.
* `exhKnown_last`, `exhKnown_of_lt`: exhaustifying *two* against a known count list leaves it
  lower-bounded when it is the top of the list and makes it exact otherwise.
* `atLeast_diff_moreThan_eq_bare`: an implicit alternative *more than two* recovers exactness.

## Implementation notes

* Scalar trials are typed by the vertices of the triangle of opposition (`Aristotelian.Triangle`),
  a box showing Cookie Monster with none, some but not all, or all of the cookies; number trials
  by the cardinality of a box.
* The choice proportions and the statistics stay in prose: the paradigm's predictions are
  categorical, and the paper's argument is that the majority choice identifies the reading.

A box's vertex of the triangle of opposition records whether Cookie Monster has none of the
cookies (`E`), some but not all of them (`IO`), or all (`A`). On the scale the vertices form,
literal *some* holds above the bottom, *all* at the top, and *some* strengthened by its
implicature *not all* strictly between. -/
