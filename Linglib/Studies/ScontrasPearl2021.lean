# Scontras and Pearl (2021): When Pragmatics Matters More for Truth-Value Judgments

This file formalizes Scontras and Pearl's Rational Speech Act model of the truth-value judgment
task for the scopally ambiguous sentences *every horse didn't jump* and *two horses didn't jump*.
A world is the number of horses that jumped. A speaker who knows the world, a scope
interpretation and a question under discussion chooses between the sentence and silence, aiming
to convey the answer to the question. A pragmatic listener inverts that speaker jointly over
worlds, interpretations and questions. The endorsing speaker, who sees only the world, chooses
between the sentence and silence by the listener's beliefs about the world, so that a truth-value
judgment is a production decision.

## Main definitions

* `ext`: the worlds at which an utterance is true under a scope interpretation, for a determiner
  given as a relation on counts.
* `project`, `cell`: the answer a question assigns to a world, and the worlds sharing that answer.
* `L0`, `S1`, `L1`, `S2`: the literal listener, the speaker, the pragmatic listener and the
  endorsing speaker, as kernels.
* `share`, `production`, `expectedProduction`: the probability that the speaker produces the
  sentence at a world under an interpretation and a question, its average over interpretations
  and questions, and the expectation of that average under the world prior.
* `endorse`: the endorsement probability as a function of production and expected production.

## Main results

* `S2_real_amb`: the endorsement probability is `endorse` of the production at the observed world
  and the expected production.
* `one_half_lt_S2_real_amb_iff`: the sentence is endorsed more often than not exactly when it is
  produced at the observed world more often than on average (§5.1).
* `S1_all_scope`, `S2_real_amb_all`: under the question *all?* the two interpretations of
  *every horse didn't jump* produce alike, so with that question settled the scope prior does
  not affect endorsement (§3.2, Figure 3).
* `share_le_share_all`, `share_none_le_share`: at the not-all world of the two-horse scenario
  *all?* maximizes and *none?* minimizes production under either interpretation (Figure 2).
* `share_antitone`, `S2_real_amb_mono_baseRate`: production falls with the number of jumpers, so
  a higher success base rate in the binomial world prior raises endorsement (Figure 2).
* `S2_numeral_eq_self`, `S2_numeral_ge_self`: with as many horses as the numeral counts, the
  numeral sentence has the extension of the *every* sentence on both interpretations, so the two
  models coincide (§4.2.1).
* `share_twoAtLeast_le_share_twoExact`, `share_twoExact_lt_share_twoAtLeast`: with four horses
  and two jumpers the surface speaker favors the exact reading whatever the question, while the
  inverse speaker under *all?* favors the at-least reading, which is why the 2-of-4 fit needs a
  low prior on inverse scope (§4.2.2, Figure 7).

## Implementation notes

* The rationality of `S1` and the priors on worlds, interpretations and questions are
  parameters. The numerical predictions of Figures 2, 3, 6 and 7, at unit rationality and the
  paper's grid of priors, are not restated, and the endorsement rates of the experiments the
  paper reviews are not data of this file.
* A determiner is a relation between the number of restrictor members outside its scope and the
  number inside it, so *every* is `every` and a numeral is membership of the inside count in
  the interval of a `Degree.Comparison`, `.eq` for the exact reading and `.ge` for the at-least
  reading. The truth conditions (2) and (6), which the paper tabulates at two and at four
  horses, follow for any number of horses (`mem_ext_every_surface`, `mem_ext_numeral_surface`
  and their inverse counterparts).
* Both models share the five questions of (7): the every-not model is the case of a question
  prior carried by the first three, and with two horses the numeral questions partition the
  worlds as *all?* does (`cell_exactlyTwo_two`, `cell_atLeastTwo_two`).
* The base-rate result is proved at two horses, the paper's scenario. For any number of horses
  it would follow from `production` being antitone and the binomial family being stochastically
  increasing in its success probability.
* Utterances are costless (fn. 8) and the literal listener carries no world prior (fn. 6),
  following [qing-franke-2015]; the projected listener is that of [kao-etal-2014-hyperbole].

/-- With four horses and two jumpers, the surface interpretation of the sentence is produced at
least as often on the exact reading of the numeral as on the at-least reading, whatever the
question: the exact reading makes the sentence true at that world alone (§4.2.2, Figure 7). -/
theorem share_twoAtLeast_le_share_twoExact (hα : 0 < α) (q : QUD) :

/-- The advantage of the exact reading is strict under every question but *all?*, which the
surface interpretation answers fully on either reading. -/
theorem share_twoAtLeast_lt_share_twoExact (hα : 0 < α) {q : QUD} (hq : q ≠ .all) :

/-- Under the inverse interpretation and the question *all?* the at-least reading is produced
more often at that world: *not exactly two jumped* is compatible with all four having jumped and
so leaves *all?* open, while *not at least two jumped* settles it. This is why the paper's 2-of-4
fit needs a low prior on inverse scope (§4.2.2, Figure 7). -/
