# Roelofsen and Farkas (2015): Polarity particle responses as a window onto the interpretation of questions and assertions

This file formalizes [roelofsen-farkas-2015]'s account of polarity particle responses. A response
carries a relative feature, [agree] or [reverse], and an absolute feature, [+] or [−], each
presupposing something of the possibilities its prejacent and its antecedent highlight; together
they fix what the response expresses (`absolutePresup_and_relativePresup_iff`). So *yes, it is*
conveys the even answer after *Is it even?* and the odd one after *Is it odd?*
(`presup_query_ofPolarity`), and on a response sharing its antecedent's radical the relative
feature is Farkas and Bruce's relative polarity (`relativePresup_smul_iff`).

Languages differ in which particles realize which features, and a particle dedicated to a
combination blocks the others. English *yes* and *no* each realize a natural class of features,
so both occur in responses to a negative antecedent (`english_usable`), while French *si* and
German *doch* realize [reverse, +] alone. The account agrees with what Farkas and Bruce say the
English particles mark (`usable_english_iff_mem`).

## Implementation notes

* The most salient antecedent possibility is the one the antecedent formula highlights; the
  discourse context of the paper is not modelled.
* Features are polarities, [agree] and [+] being positive, so the prejacent of a relative feature
  `r` highlights `r • β` for the antecedent possibility `β`.
* In the planets examples *odd* is the complement of *even*, so each proposition is recorded as
  the polarity whose action yields it from *even*.
* French (9) prints its French sentences in the opposite order to their glosses; the French rows
  are (119)–(122).

## TODO

* The Romanian and Hungarian systems of §5.1, and the preferences among realizable particles,
  which rest on markedness, are not formalized.
