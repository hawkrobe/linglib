# Francescotti (1995): Even: The Conventional Implicature Approach Reconsidered

This file formalizes [francescotti-1995]'s felicity condition for *even*: the sentence without
*even* must be more surprising than most of its contextually determined true neighbors, against
[bennett-1982]'s one neighbor and [karttunen-peters-1979]'s all. The three conditions are one
threshold on the number of neighbors the prejacent surpasses (`Meets`); they are ordered
(`meets_most_of_universal`, `meets_existential_of_most`), and the paper's two counterexamples
are the two gaps between them: surpassing exactly one of several neighbors meets Bennett's
condition but not the majority (`not_meets_most_of_one`), and surpassing all but one meets the
majority but not Karttunen and Peters' (`meets_most_of_all_but_one`). The universal threshold
is the scalar presupposition `Focus.Particles.evenPresup`.

## Implementation notes

Neighbors are a list of alternatives with a surprise comparison, and the thresholds read the
count of neighbors the prejacent surpasses, so the vagueness of *most* is the threshold itself;
the paper's second gradient, the margin of surprise, is not formalized. The rows record the
paper's scenarios by the counts its descriptions fix: how many neighbors the prejacent surpasses
and how many there are.
