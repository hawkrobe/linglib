# de Hoop and Malchukov (2008): Case-marking strategies

This file formalizes the two case-marking strategies of [de-hoop-malchukov-2008]: the
identifying function, (10), by which case encodes a property of the argument itself, and the
distinguishing function, (15), by which case tells the two arguments of a transitive clause
apart. Both are violable constraints evaluated against ECONOMY in the bidirectional Optimality
Theory of [blutner-2000], on the assumption that a morphologically unmarked case is the absence
of case, as in [aissen-2003]. Arguments are strong or weak by their discourse prominence, and
a strong subject is the typical, distinguishable one while a strong object is the atypical,
subject-like one, so DISTINGUISHABILITY targets the weak subject and the strong object where
IDENTIFY targets the strong argument in either position. The superoptimal pairs of the
tableaux follow: the strategies converge in differential object marking, both marking the
strong object as in Hindi, and diverge in differential subject marking, IDENTIFY marking the
volitional subject of Manipuri and DISTINGUISHABILITY the weak subject of Fore, which explains
the robustness of the one alternation and the variability of the other. In a symmetrical
alternation between two overt cases, Lezgian's ergative and oblique or Finnish's accusative
and partitive, DISTINGUISHABILITY is vacuously satisfied, so the alternation is necessarily due
to IDENTIFY. Section 4 replaces ECONOMY by PAIP, (42), which penalizes case on the primary
actant, the argument encoded like the intransitive subject, so that differential marking is
free of it on the object of a nominative-accusative and the subject of an ergative-absolutive
language, where differential object and subject marking are found, while the other two
alternations conflict with IDENTIFY and are resolved by voice, the passive making the object
and the antipassive the subject the unmarked argument.

## Implementation notes

A form is `Option C` over the language's overt cases, `none` the absence of case; the
asymmetrical games have one overt case, and the symmetrical game omits the caseless form
since the Case Filter outranks ECONOMY there. Superoptimality is the computable
`Pragmatics.Bidirectional.superoptimal`, and each tableau is one `decide`.

## TODO

Tableau (41) for Aranda lists the ergative on the inanimate subject as a third superoptimal
pair, blocked under [blutner-2000]'s definition by the ergative on the first person, which
shares its form with a better profile; the paper keeps it by arguing that the one ergative
form cannot be ambiguous between a first person and an inanimate. `aranda` states what the
blocking relation gives, the first person marked and the intermediate types caseless.

def asymmetrical : Finset (Option Unit × Strength) :=
  {(some (), .strong), (some (), .weak), (none, .strong), (none, .weak)}

/-- Tableaux (18), (31) and (39): IDENTIFY over ECONOMY marks the strong argument in either
position, Manipuri's ergative on the volitional subject, Hindi's accusative and Central Pomo's
patientive on the strong object. -/

      {(some (), pos.confusable), (none, pos.confusable.opposite)} := by

/-! ### Symmetrical differential marking -/

/-- The two overt cases of a symmetrical alternation: the one identifying the strong
argument, Lezgian's ergative and Finnish's accusative, and the other, their oblique and
partitive. -/
inductive Overt where
  | identifying
  | other
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

ECONOMY. -/

/-- Tableaux (24) and (29): IDENTIFY pairs each overt case with a strength, ergative with the
volitional and oblique with the nonvolitional subject in Lezgian, accusative with the strong

being case-marked. -/

  cases m <;> decide

/-- So it cannot drive a symmetrical alternation: under DISTINGUISHABILITY over ECONOMY every
pair is superoptimal and no case is paired with a strength. Symmetrical differential marking
is necessarily due to IDENTIFY. -/

/-! ### Both strategies at once -/

    (none, .firstPerson), (none, .intermediate), (none, .inanimate)}

/-- Tableau (41): with DISTINGUISHABILITY over IDENTIFY over ECONOMY, the first person takes
the ergative by IDENTIFY and the intermediate types stay caseless; the paper's ergative on the
inanimate is blocked by the first person's, see the module's TODO. -/

inductive Alignment where

def paip (al : Alignment) : Constraint (Position × Option C × M) :=
  .binary λ p => p.1 = al.primaryActant ∧ p.2.1.isSome

/-- Differential marking is free of PAIP off the primary actant and violates it there: object
marking in a nominative-accusative and subject marking in an ergative-absolutive language
satisfy it, which is where differential object and subject marking are found. -/
