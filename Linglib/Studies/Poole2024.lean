# Poole (2024): Dependent-case assignment could be Agree

This file formalizes [poole-2024]'s argument that dependent case, the innovation of
[marantz-1991]'s configurational model, can be assigned by Agree. A head carries the probe stack
(8): a φ-probe relativized to unmarked case, which values on the closest caseless DP and so
records that a second DP is present, followed by a case-assigning probe with the same
relativization, active only once the first is valued and, by the Principle of Minimal
Compliance, blind to the first probe's goal ([rackowski-richards-2005]). Low dependent case
comes from a stack on a head above both DPs, which meets them in c-command order; high
dependent case from a stack on the head that introduces the higher DP, which searches its
complement and then, by specifier–head Agree ([bejar-rezac-2009]), the specifier it merges
with. Either way the stack assigns nothing with fewer than two caseless DPs in its domain and
never marks the DP that unlocked it (`stack_eq_none_of_subsingleton`, `stack_ne_unlocker`).

On a two-DP domain the stack assigns exactly what the dependent rule of the configurational
model assigns, low or high, whatever lexical case the DPs carry (`low_eq_dependentPass`,
`high_eq_dependentPass`); this is the paper's translation of any configurational account into
an Agree account. The two mechanisms part on a third caseless DP, which the configurational
rule also marks and a single stack, discharged once, does not (`stack_marks_once`). The Sakha
illustration of §5 puts a dative stack on V and an accusative stack on T; on every clause
shape of table (19) the two stacks assign the cases that the dative and accusative rules of
[baker-vinokurova-2010] assign (`sakha_eq_bakerVinokurova`), and accusative appears on a DP
exactly when it is accessible to T and another caseless DP unlocks the stack, as in (15),
(18) and (20) (`accusative_rows`).

## Implementation notes

Probes are the substrate's `Probe.search` over goals paired with their positions, so that
minimal compliance is the removal of the unlocking position and case is assigned by position;
the two-DP theorems then hold for arbitrary labels and lexical cases by computation. What the
stack assigns is recorded as valued by Agree, the configurational rule as valued by a dependent
rule, and the theorems compare the cases, which is the extensional equivalence the paper
argues for; the provenance is where the two models differ by design. Unmarked case, case
discrimination below the unmarked setting, and the negative c-command rules of §6.1 are not
formalized.
