# Jäger (2014): Rationalizable Signaling

Jäger models pragmatic interpretation in a semantic game, a signaling game whose signals have
literal meanings and whose players may be unsure of each other's preferences. Starting from the
credulous receiver, each player in turn plays a best response to some belief that gives every
strategy the other might currently play positive weight, an unexpected signal being read as
true; the strategies that recur arbitrarily late are pragmatically rationalizable, the notion
Jäger and Ebert also develop, and they are rationalizable in the classical sense
(`prs_rationalizable`). Worked examples derive the scalar implicature of "some", Horn's division
of pragmatic labor, the context-dependent precision of round numbers and the breakdown of
communication under opposed interests, and contrast the model with Franke's iterated best
response.

## Implementation notes

* Beliefs are points of mathlib's `Convexity.StdSimplex`; the paper's distributions over a set
  `P` of strategies, all of them or only those positive on all of `P`, are the beliefs whose
  support is contained in, respectively equal to, `P`.
* The iterated cautious response sequence is an iterate of `receiverStep` and the pragmatically
  rationalizable strategies are its limit superior; `mem_prsR_iff` is the paper's definition,
  which prints `s` for `r` in its receiver half.
* A signal or an action that some alternative weakly dominates against every strategy the other
  player might play is never a cautious response (`senderCR_subset`, `receiverCR_subset`). This is
  the sound half of the note on computing the sequence, which goes on to compute cautious
  responses separately at each context and world. Since one belief serves all of them, that
  computation can overcount: with one context, receivers `f ↦ a₁, f' ↦ a₂` and `f ↦ a₂, f' ↦ a₁`,
  the sender wanting `a₁` in `w₁` and `a₂` in `w₂`, and `f'` costing `0.2`, sending `f'` is optimal
  in `w₁` only if the first receiver has weight at most `0.4` and in `w₂` only if it has weight at
  least `0.6`. The stages displayed for Example 5 overcount in this way.
* The examples are set in `Fin n`, the `k`-th world, signal or action of the paper being
  `k - 1`; each example's docstring names its signals.
* Section 3 asserts that under the right panel of Table 4 alone Sally would use "some but not
  all" when not all is true and never use "some", so that the implicature needs the other
  context. Under the definitions the unused "some" may be read as not-all after a belief revision,
  and two rounds later it carries the implicature
  (`NoImplicatureContext.some_still_implicates_not_all`). Table 8 swaps Table 4's context labels.
* The recurrence sets displayed for Example 2 are products, which by the paper's convention for
  such tables contain every strategy; the sequence cycles through two stages and the pragmatically
  rationalizable strategies are their union (`Opposed.prs_eq`).
* The stages displayed for Example 8 move away from the credulous ones, but the receiver's belief
  about the sender's context has full support, so "100 m" stays read as `100 m` and the sequence
  never moves; "exactly 100 m" is never used (`Precision.exactly_never_used`). The paper's verbal
  conclusions hold.
* Table 14 labels the last sender set of its left panel `S₀`; it is `S₁`.
* Example 10's "some but not all" costs a parameter `c` with `0 < c < 1`, the paper saying only
  that the cost is small. Franke's iterated best response is his costless light system
  (`Franke2011.receiverChain`), which agrees with the paper's costly variant when `c < 1/2`.

## TODO

* Examples 1, 3, 5 and 7, the uniform-prior variant of Example 6 in Section 6, and the notions of
  credibility of Section 7. Example 7 contrasts the model with weak bidirectional optimality,
  which the library has in `Pragmatics/Bidirectional.lean`.
* The converse dominance direction: a pure strategy that no mixture weakly dominates is a
  cautious response, with one context, via the Farkas alternative in
  `Core/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Farkas.lean`.

A signal that an alternative weakly dominates against every receiver strategy and context the
sender considers possible, strictly against one, earns less under every full-support belief, so
it is never a cautious response; symmetrically for the receiver's actions, compared at the
worlds where the signal is sent. -/
