# Levin (2026): The door pushed open

This file formalizes Levin's analysis of the English intransitive resultative with
transitive-only verbs, *The door pushed open*, *The cork pulled free*, *The valve slammed
shut*. Outside the resultative these verbs have no intransitive use whose subject is their
object, *The door pushed*. Levin takes the intransitive resultative to be the anticausative
variant of the causative alternation and its transitive counterpart the causative variant. The
resultative describes a change of state that the verb alone does not, which is what makes the
alternation available, and the conditions on the anticausative variant decide when the cause
may go unexpressed.

The verbs are verbs of exerting force and verbs of surface contact, manner verbs that do not
lexicalize a change (`VerbKind`). The result adjectives are *open*, *closed*, *shut*, *free*,
*loose* and *flat* in the sense that describes a spatial configuration with respect to a
reference entity, and not in their other senses, *free of shards*. The subject must be able to
move without the continuous involvement of a cause, as an animate, a machine or a projectile
can (`Theme.SelfEnergetic`), since a change of state properly contained in the causing act
requires the cause to be expressed, the Proper Containment Condition of Rappaport Hovav and
Levin (`CauseRequired`). Neither the verb nor the adjective suffices alone, and a sentence of
the paper is acceptable exactly when the three conditions meet or the verb alternates by
itself (`acceptable_iff_licensed`). Neo-constructional approaches, on which a verb's lexical
properties do not constrain its distribution, expect every verb in every resultative pattern, and
must explain why such intransitive resultatives are not more pervasive: *The tub scrubbed clean*
is unacceptable (footnote 7, (16); `exists_unacceptable_intransitive_resultative`).

## Implementation notes

The verb classes are the paper's own lists, not the classes of Levin's 1993 book, from which
they differ, *fling* being there a verb of throwing, as the paper notes
(`exertingForce_not_all_pushPull`). The discourse conditions on the anticausative
variant, a cause recoverable from the context or of unknown identity, are conditions of use
that no judgment of the paper isolates, and are not modelled; nor are the two intransitive
resultatives with other adjectives that the paper offers as possible one-off instances. The
kind of the subject is recorded for the rows whose subject the paper discusses.
