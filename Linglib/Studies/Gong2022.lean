# Gong (2022): Case in Wholesale Late Merger: Evidence from Mongolian Scrambling

This file formalizes [gong-2022]'s argument that Condition C reconstruction in Mongolian
scrambling tracks case rather than the A/Ā distinction or the subject status of the binder.
Under [takahashi-hulsey-2009]'s wholesale late merger a determiner moves alone and its restrictor
merges countercyclically at a chain position where the resulting DP receives case, so scrambling
bleeds Condition C exactly when the chain has a case position above the pronoun binder, the
paper's condition (2) (`Bleeds`). The hybrid case rules (26) make accusative a dependent case,
valued on an NP that an unmarked argumental NP of the same domain c-commands, nominative the
case finite T assigns, and dative nonstructural (`Site.DependentAcc`, `Site.Nominative`). Read
off the derivations (27b), (28b), (29c), (55), and (57), the chain positions of short,
intermediate, and long-distance scrambling predict every judgment of the pool
(`rows_reconstruction`): a dative binder is bled and a subject binder is not, while the
embedded-subject binder of (61) is bled because the matrix VP-adjoined position competes for case
with the matrix subject, which refutes [frank-lee-rambow-1996]'s Subject Binding Generalization
(`sbg_fails`) and is what an account by movement type cannot state (`is_not_uniform`). The same
dependent-case rule licenses accusative on an embedded subject exactly when a nominative matrix
competitor is present, section 5.1 (`acc_subjects`), and the Mongolian grammar differs from
[baker-vinokurova-2010]'s Sakha only in having no dependent dative
(`mongolian_differs_from_sakha_in_dat_only`).

## Implementation notes

Heights order the positions of a clause and, for clause-external scrambling, the matrix clause
above the embedded one. A site records the arguments of its spell-out domain with the case they
bear when the mover lands, so the presubject position sees a subject already valued nominative,
the paper's assumption that case is valued as soon as its conditions are met. A lexically cased
DP is licensed in its base position and a PP has no restrictor to late-merge, so neither can be
bled. The CP edge of an embedded clause is a step of successive-cyclic movement without a case
competitor.
