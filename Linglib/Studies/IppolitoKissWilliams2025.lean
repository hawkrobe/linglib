# Ippolito, Kiss and Williams (2025): Discourse *only*

This file formalizes [ippolito-kiss-williams-2025], the account of discourse *only*, the
particle of *the house is beautiful, only it's too expensive* whose prejacent may be a
declarative, an interrogative, an imperative or an exclamative. Support, agreement and
disagreement are those of [ippolito-kiss-williams-2022], with sentences of every clause type
denoting sets of propositions, (13) to (15). A context (`Context`) adds the true partial
answers to the question under discussion established in the discourse, and the meaning (16)
has a definedness condition, that both arguments are relevant and the left argument supports
an answer (`Context.Defined`), and a conventional implicature (`Context.CI`): some answer that
every established partial answer other than the prejacent supports and the prejacent does not.
A canonical question, none of whose answers the speaker believes, supports nothing, so it
cannot be the left argument, (19) and (6), while as prejacent it satisfies the second clause of
the implicature, (18); a rhetorical or otherwise committed question can be the left argument,
(20) and (21). The house-buying context of Section 5 is built explicitly and the declarative
and interrogative cases derived in it.

## Implementation notes

* The paper's first clause of the implicature quantifies over every true partial answer outside
  the question under discussion; its prose excludes the prejacent, which the formal statement
  would contradict, so the exclusion is built in as `p ∉ alt S'`.
* The implicature "ensures lack of agreement" between the arguments only when the left argument
  supports no answer but the implicature's, which `not_agree_of_ci` assumes.
* The cross-linguistic distribution of Section 7 (Italian *solo che*, Russian *tol'ko*,
  Hungarian *csak* and *csakhogy*, Mandarin *zhǐshì*) and the weight asymmetry of Section 6 are
  recorded as example rows; the paper derives from the semantics only that a left-argument
  question must be non-canonical.
