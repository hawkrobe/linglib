# Coppock & Wechsler (2018): The Proper Treatment of Egophoricity in Kathmandu Newari

This file formalizes Coppock and Wechsler's account of egophoric marking in Kathmandu Newari.
Newari verbs carry no person agreement. A special *egophoric* form appears in statements about
the speaker, in questions about the addressee, and in reports where the reported speaker was
knowingly talking about herself. The plain form appears elsewhere.

A sentence is evaluated at a context, a world and an agent called the *perspectival center*, and
the egophoric suffix presupposes that the subject is the center (`ego`). Every context has an
*authority*, the speaker of a statement and the addressee of a question, and a speech act
proposes its meaning with the authority as center. When the subject is not the authority the
proposal is empty and the conversation cannot continue (`inCrisis_assert_ego`,
`inCrisis_ask_ego`), which gives *I* in statements and *you* in questions. A report is true only
if the reported speaker took the subject to be herself (`says_ego_iff`). A simpler account, on
which the suffix presupposes that the subject is the authority, agrees on main clauses and
fails when Syam comments on a photograph of himself that he does not recognize (`lampshade`).

## Implementation notes

* The Table records the public side of the paper's discourse model, the common ground and its
  projections. The centered meaning is the argument of `assert`, `ask` and `Says`.
* Expressions of the paper's logic are given by their meanings rather than as syntax, and time
  is ignored as in the paper.

## TODO

The paper marks the second-person question with the plain form as unacceptable. The account
derives where the egophoric form is excluded, not where it is required.
