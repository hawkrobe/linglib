# [krifka-1998] *The Origins of Telicity*

K98's two distinctive contributions, formalized end-to-end:

* **Part I — §3 Incrementality** (CUM/QUA propagation through SINC/INC
  verbs; Vendler classification; for/in diagnostics).
* **Part II — §4 Movement** (path/movement extension of mereological
  telicity: a movement event is telic iff its path is bounded; EXP /
  SEINC / ADJ / SMR / MovementClosure / MR propositional substrate).

The substrate predicates (SUM, UO, UE, MO, MSO, MSE, GUE, SINC, INC,
CumTheta — K98 §3.2 eq. 43-52, eq. 59) live in
`Semantics/Events/{Incrementality,ThematicRoleProperties}.lean`;
the σ-trace pullback machinery in `Semantics/Spatial/Trace.lean`.
This file exercises both on the English fragment and inlines the §4
movement-relation predicates (formerly in
`Semantics/Events/MovementRelations.lean`).

## Main definitions

Part I (§3 incrementality):

* Per-verb `*_sinc` / `*_inc` / `*_cumOnly` tripwire theorems
* VendlerClass → MereoTag bridge via `Telicity.toMereoTag`
* `eat_two_apples_qua_propositional` / `eat_apples_cum_propositional` —
  K98 §3.3 propagation invoked on abstract θ
* `IsSincVerb (eatThemeToy)` instance + applied propagation theorems
  (the constructive witness that the typeclass admits non-axiomatic
  realizations)
* K89 ↔ K98 sister-paper refinement bridge (uses
  `K89ThematicClass.toVerbIncClass` from `Studies/Krifka1989.lean`)

Part II (§4 movement):

* `EXP` / `SEINC` / `ADJ` / `SMR` — K98 §4 propositional predicates
* `MovementClosure` / `MR` — K98 §4.3 closure substrate (TANG_H-free)
* `expEv` / `seincEv` / `smrPath` / `mrPath` — `Event Time` instantiations
* `MotionVPDatum` / `motionData` — Bool-tag-level VP data
* `walked_from_to_telic_propositional` /
  `walked_towards_atelic_propositional` — σ-pullback theorems backing
  the K98 §4.5 *walked from X to Y* / *walked towards X* analyses

The `### K98 §2.5` section defines the INI/FIN initial/final-part predicates
and the propositional `TEL` predicate (`IsTelic`), with `isTelic_of_qua`
giving Krifka's `QUA → TEL` direction; `Telicity.toMereoTag .telic = .qua`
remains the coarse tag-level collapse used by the Vendler bridge.

## TODO

* **TEL ⊋ QUA strict witness**: the telic-but-not-QUA half of K98 §2.5
  (the run-time-3-to-4-pm predicate) needs a concrete event model and is
  not yet exhibited; `isTelic_of_qua` proves only the `QUA → TEL` half.
* **TANG_H tangentiality** (K98 eq. 17) on directed paths. Without it,
  `MR` admits telekinetic non-meeting concatenations (K98 eq. 70.c).
  Adding TANG_H requires a `DirectedPath` substrate not yet in linglib.
* **Cross-dimensional movements** (K98 §4.6: heat, bake, whip — eq. 76-77).
  Structurally identical to spatial movements; require the same
  `DirectedPath` generalization.
* **Full ADJ axioms** on adjacency (K98 §2.3 eq. 14.b). The concrete
  `Path.adjacent` + `Event.adjacent` satisfy them but the propositional
  theorems are not added.
* **`cumOnly` is the formaliser's term, not K98's.** K98 distinguishes
  verbs that are merely cumulative (CUM, eq. 44) without strict
  incrementality (¬SINC, ¬MSE). The `VerbIncClass.cumOnly` constructor
  name is anachronistic shorthand.

## What this file is NOT

* Not a critique of K98's classification — that's `Studies/Filip2012.lean`
  (three-way CUM / QUA / ¬CUM ∧ ¬QUA via K98 §3.3 propagation).
* Not a fragment-only verb-annotation file — fragment annotations in
  `Fragments/English/Predicates/Verbal.lean` are tested per-verb here
  as a tripwire layer.

/-! ### Per-Verb Incrementality Verification -/

/-! Each verb's `verbIncClass` annotation is verified by `rfl`. Changing
    any annotation breaks exactly one theorem here. These earn their
    place as fragment-annotation tripwires; mathlib would call them
    `example`s, but as `theorem`s they're discoverable via `#check`. -/

/-- "eat" is strictly incremental (consumption: bijective theme-event map). -/
theorem eat_sinc : eat.toVerb.verbIncClass = some .sinc := rfl

/-- "devour" is strictly incremental (consumption variant of eat). -/

/-- "run" is an activity. -/

/-! ### VendlerClass → MereoTag Bridge -/

/-! These connect the Vendler classification to K89's CUM/QUA distinction
    via `Telicity.toMereoTag`. The chain is:
    VendlerClass → Telicity → MereoTag → CUM/QUA mereological property.

    **Caveat: TEL ⊋ QUA in K98, but collapsed here.** K98 §2.5 eq. 37
    defines TEL_E (telicity) strictly weaker than QUA (quantization):
    every QUA predicate is TEL, but not every TEL predicate is QUA (K98
    gives the run-time-3-to-4-pm counterexample). The
    `Telicity.toMereoTag .telic = .qua` collapse used here is faithful for
    the typical Vendler-class accomplishments and achievements (which are
    both TEL and QUA): `isTelic_of_qua` proves the `QUA → TEL` direction
    those classes rely on. The full TEL ⊋ QUA gap (a telic non-QUA
    predicate) is not collapsed by `toMereoTag`; the `IsTelic` predicate in
    the `### K98 §2.5` section above states the distinct, weaker notion. -/

/-- Accomplishments are telic, hence (under the TEL = QUA collapse) QUA. -/
theorem accomplishment_is_qua :
    VendlerClass.accomplishment.telicity.toMereoTag = .qua := rfl

/-- Achievements are telic, hence QUA. -/
theorem achievement_is_qua :
    VendlerClass.achievement.telicity.toMereoTag = .qua := rfl

/-- Activities are atelic, hence CUM. -/
theorem activity_is_cum :
    VendlerClass.activity.telicity.toMereoTag = .cum := rfl

/-- States are atelic, hence CUM. -/
theorem state_is_cum :
    VendlerClass.state.telicity.toMereoTag = .cum := rfl

/-! ### Compositional Telicity (VP = verb + NP) -/

/-! The payoff: verb incrementality + NP reference property → VP telicity.
    These instantiate K98 §3.3 (eq. 53-54) for concrete verb entries.

    Round-1 audit additions: propositional invocations of K98 theory's
    `cum_propagation` and `qua_propagation` on abstract θ instances
    (parallel to K89 study §3's `qmod_of_cum_is_qua` calls), making the
    Bool-tag conjunctions below into substrate-honest derivations
    rather than stipulated `⟨rfl, rfl⟩`. -/

/-- "eat apples": sinc verb + CUM NP → CUM VP (atelic).
    K98 §3.3: CumTheta(θ) ∧ CUM(OBJ) → CUM(VP θ OBJ).
    The verb's incrementality class is sinc, and bare plurals are CUM. -/
theorem eat_apples_atelic :
    eat.toVerb.verbIncClass = some .sinc ∧
    VendlerClass.activity.telicity.toMereoTag = .cum := ⟨rfl, rfl⟩

/-- "eat two apples": sinc verb + QUA NP → QUA VP (telic).
    K98 §3.3: SINC(θ) ∧ QUA(OBJ) → QUA(VP θ OBJ).
    The verb's incrementality class is sinc, and "two apples" is QUA. -/
theorem eat_two_apples_telic :
    eat.toVerb.verbIncClass = some .sinc ∧
    VendlerClass.accomplishment.telicity.toMereoTag = .qua := ⟨rfl, rfl⟩

/-- "build a house": sinc verb + QUA NP → QUA VP (telic). -/
theorem build_a_house_telic :
    build.toVerb.verbIncClass = some .sinc ∧
    VendlerClass.accomplishment.telicity.toMereoTag = .qua := ⟨rfl, rfl⟩

/-- "read the book": inc verb + QUA NP → VP is telic
    (INC is weaker than SINC, but still transmits QUA from NP to VP
    when the object is quantized, K98 §3.6). -/
theorem read_the_book_telic :
    read.toVerb.verbIncClass = some .inc ∧
    VendlerClass.accomplishment.telicity.toMereoTag = .qua := ⟨rfl, rfl⟩

/-- "push the cart": cumOnly verb → no telicity transfer from NP.
    Regardless of the NP's reference property, cumOnly verbs yield
    atelic (CUM) VPs. -/
theorem push_the_cart_atelic :
    push.toVerb.verbIncClass = some .cumOnly := rfl

/-- "write a letter": sinc verb + QUA NP → QUA VP (telic). -/
theorem write_a_letter_telic :
    write.toVerb.verbIncClass = some .sinc ∧
    VendlerClass.accomplishment.telicity.toMereoTag = .qua := ⟨rfl, rfl⟩

/-! ### §4.5 Propositional propagation invocations (typeclass form)

    The Bool-tag conjunctions above check fragment annotations and tag
    composition; the theorems below actually invoke K98 theory's
    `cum_propagation` and `qua_propagation` (typeclass-canonical
    forms) on abstract θ + OBJ instances. This is the same shape as
    K89 study §3's calls of `qmod_of_cum_is_qua` — making the
    substrate-bridge promise concrete rather than rhetorical. -/

variable {α β : Type*} [SemilatticeSup α] [SemilatticeSup β]

/-- *eat apples* propositional: K98 §3.3 CUM propagation. Given any
    `[IsCumThetaVerb θ]` (eat's role — and any of the K98 verb classes
    via upward instances) and a CUM object (apples), VP is CUM. -/

end PropositionalPropagation

/-! ### Diagnostic Bridge -/

/-! Connect CUM/QUA → for/in diagnostic compatibility.
    Atelic (CUM) VPs accept "for X"; telic (QUA) VPs accept "in X".

    Round-1 audit deletions: 6 per-verb `inXPrediction .X = .accept := rfl`
    theorems removed — they were tautological restatements of the
    `Diagnostics.inXPrediction` definition (since `eat_two_apples_licenses_inX`
    and `build_a_house_licenses_inX` had identical statements, both
    passing `.accomplishment`, neither was about a specific verb). The
    general `telic_licenses_inX` and `durative_atelic_licenses_forX`
    below carry the diagnostic bridge work. -/

/-- Telic VPs (QUA) license "in X" adverbials. -/

    inXPrediction c = .accept := by

/-! ### Cross-Verification: Incrementality × Vendler -/

    classes: only accomplishments can have non-none verbIncClass. -/

/-! ## Gradual Change (GRAD) Predictions -/

/-! Connects GRAD theory to concrete verb entries.

    Round-1 audit fixes: `GRADDatum.verb : String` and
    `GRADDatum.objectMeasure : String` were the round-2-K89 String-field
    anti-pattern recreated; replaced with `GRADVerb` enum +
    `GRADObjectMeasure` enum. `native_decide` on `all_grad_data_matches`
    eliminated by structurally lifting the verb match into the enum's
    `toIncClass` projection. -/

/-! ### K98 §3.5 Eq. 58: Mary ate peanuts in 0.43 seconds -/

/-! K98 §3.5 (page 18, eq. 58) introduces *Mary is an incredibly fast
    eater. Yesterday she ate peanuts in 0.43 seconds!* — K98's own
    version of K89 §5's *Ann drank wine in 0.43 sec*. K98 uses it to
    argue that **temporal atomicity** (not quantization) is what
    licenses *in*-X adverbials: "even though *eat peanuts* is not
    quantized, it can be understood as temporally atomic. One chewing
    move may be a part of an event of eating peanuts, but not yet an
    event of eating peanuts."

    The K89 study has an analogous ATM section (citing K89 T4); this
    file mirrors it for K98 §3.5. The substrate-witness theorem
    (showing a CUM-but-temporally-atomic predicate accepts *in*-X)
    requires event-CEM atom infrastructure beyond this file's scope;
    documented as data + linguistic motivation. -/

/-- The K98 §3.5 atomicity-vs-quantization argument has three structural
    parts: the object NP's mereological reference type, the VP's
    licensing condition for *in*-X, and the temporal-atomicity flag
    that licenses *in*-X even when QUA fails. Captured here as a
    structure with enum-typed fields (`MereoTag`, `DiagnosticResult`)
    rather than a triple of `Bool`s — Bool tags would be the round-2
    K89 anti-pattern. -/

    closure, cf. K89 §3 / `Krifka1989.applesNP`). The bounded-duration
    eating predicate is temporally atomic — no sub-event of a 0.43-second
    peanut-eating is also a 0.43-second peanut-eating. K98 §3.5 argues
    this licenses *in*-X via temporal atomicity, not quantization. -/

/-- The K98 §3.5 eq. 58 witness pattern: CUM object + accepted *in*-X.
    The combination is unusual — typical *in*-X licensing requires QUA
    objects via the K98 §3.3 propagation chain. K98 introduces this
    case to motivate temporal atomicity as an alternative licensing
    pathway. K89 §5 makes the parallel point with *Ann drank wine in
    0.43 sec* (formalized in `Krifka1989.annDrankWineInSeconds`); this
    is K98's same observation reformulated as temporal atomicity. The
    propositional ATM-but-not-QUA witness is deferred (requires
    event-CEM atom infrastructure beyond this file's scope, as
    documented in K89 study §5). -/

/-! ### K89 ↔ K98 Sister-Paper Bridge -/

/-! K89 (1989) and K98 (1998) are the same author refining the same
    theory at two stages. K89 study now defines
    `K89ThematicClass.toVerbIncClass` in `Studies/Krifka1989.lean`,
    mapping K89's table-14 thematic-relation classes to K98's
    `VerbIncClass`. This section provides the K98-side acknowledgement
    of the bridge: every K89 thematic class corresponds to exactly one

/-! ### Concrete `IsSincVerb` Toy + Applied Propagation -/

/-! §4.5's `eat_apples_cum_propositional` and `eat_two_apples_qua_propositional`
    are parametric over an abstract θ. This section provides a
    constructive `IsSincVerb` instance and *fires* both propagation
    theorems on it, demonstrating that K98 §3.3's typeclass-bundled
    meaning postulates admit real (non-axiomatic) realizations.

    The toy: a 3-apple universe modelled as `Finset (Fin 3)` (powerset
    lattice; ⊔ = ∪, < = ⊊). The eating relation is the identity
    `eatThemeToy a e := a = e` — the eating event is identified with
    the apple set eaten. Each subevent of an eating-of-{0,1}
    corresponds bijectively to a subobject (the apples eaten in that
    subevent), which is exactly the SINC bijection.

    Lexical commitment: this is a TOY model, not a faithful denotation
    of *eat*. A real denotation would (i) use a richer event type with
    manner/agent/time information, (ii) admit non-trivial UO failures
    (two distinct eatings of the same apple), and (iii) interact with
    `Fragments/English/Predicates/Verbal.lean`'s `eat.semantics`. The
    purpose here is to demonstrate that the typeclass admits
    constructive instances — bridging the gap that prior `class
    VerbIncrementality` attempts left open. -/

/-! ### K98 §2.5 — Initial/final parts and telicity (TEL)

K98 §2.5 eq. 36 defines the initial and final parts of an event via the
precedence relation `«E`; eq. 37 defines telicity (TEL) of a predicate:
every P-part of a P-event is both an initial and a final part of it. TEL is
strictly weaker than `QUA` — every quantized predicate is telic
(`isTelic_of_qua`), but not conversely: K98's run-time-3-to-4-pm predicate
is telic without being quantized. Generic over a part order and a
precedence relation, mirroring the §4 substrate below; specialize with
`Event.precedes`. (Migrated here from the orphaned
`Semantics/Events/InitialFinalParts.lean`, which no module imported.) -/

/-- K98 §2.5 eq. 36 INI: `e'` is an initial part of `e` iff `e' ≤ e` and no
    part of `e` precedes `e'`. Krifka prints the outer relation as `≤D`, but
    the event signature carries only event parthood and the prose says *part
    of e* — so both relations are the single part order `≤`. -/

/-- K98 §2.5 eq. 37 propositional telicity (TEL): a predicate `P` is telic
    iff every P-instance `e'` that is part of a P-instance `e` is both an
    initial and a final part of `e`. K98: "all parts of e that fall under X
    are initial and final parts of e." Telicity is a property of the
    predicate `P`, not of any particular event. -/

/-- K98 §2.5: "it is obvious that quantized predicates are telic" — the `⊇`
    half of TEL ⊋ QUA. A `QUA` predicate has no proper P-parts, so its only
    P-part `e' ≤ e` is `e` itself, which is its own initial and final part —
    *provided* no part of `e` precedes `e`. That proviso is K98 eq. 35
    (mereologically comparable events never precede each other), supplied
    here as `hax`. The strict witness (a telic non-QUA predicate, K98's
    3-to-4-pm case) needs a concrete event model and is not proved here.
    Note `Event.precedes` does *not* satisfy `hax` — `isBefore` uses `≤`, so
    it is reflexive on punctual events; a Krifka-faithful strict precedence
    (`isBefore` with `<`) would. -/
