# Krifka (1998): The Origins of Telicity

Krifka treats telicity as a property of event predicates: a predicate is telic when no event it
applies to has a proper part it also applies to that starts or ends at a different time
(`Aspect.IsTelic`). For verbs of consumption and creation telicity follows from the transfer of
part structure between object and event that a strictly incremental thematic relation performs,
and for verbs of movement it follows from expansion, adjacency, and the source and goal of the
path. Quantized predicates are telic but not conversely, and cumulative predicates that apply to
two non-contemporaneous events are atelic.

## Main results

* `eat_apples_cum`, `eat_two_apples_qua`: on a model of *eat*, *eat apples* is cumulative and
  *eat two apples* is quantized.
* `isTelic_vp_of_seinc`: expansion with mapping to objects makes the verb phrase of a quantized
  object telic.
* `isTelic_sourceGoal`: a movement with a specified source and goal is telic.
* `Reading.not_isTelic_read`: incrementality does not guarantee telicity, since re-reading the end
  of an article gives a reading with a non-final part that is also a reading.
* `Movement`: the paper's movement diagrams, checked against adjacency on a finite model.

## Implementation notes

* The model of *eat* identifies an event with the apples it consumes, so its verb phrases are the
  object predicates themselves; the transfer from object to verb phrase is the general
  `Aspect.vp_cum` and `Aspect.vp_qua`.
* Temporal precedence is a parameter of the telicity notions. The paper's consequence of
  its event axioms that overlapping events never precede each other enters as
  `NoPartPrecedes`, which is all the proofs use.
* Overlap is `Mereology.Overlap`, relative to a possible null element. The paper's part
  structures have none, so the expansion theorems assume that the thematic relation never
  relates the null object.
* The source and goal conditions quantify the subpath and the subevent separately; the
  formalization ties them through the thematic relation, as the paper's telicity proof does.
* The measure adverbial (55) is formalized only through its part relation `IsTemporalPart`,
  without its presupposed universal clause over the parts of the witness `e′`.
* The strict-movement telicity claim of the paper does not follow from adjacency and
  mapping to objects alone (adjacency may be empty), and the tangentiality condition on
  sums of movements, the derived measure functions for movement and the changes in other
  dimensions are not formalized.
* In the finite model, the diagram's detour consists of the segments `h` and `i`; the
  paper's list of movements calls the second one `j`.

An article has two paragraphs, read by the events `0`, `1` and `2`, the last two both reading the

closure of strict reading under sums, which is incremental but lets the reader go back. -/
