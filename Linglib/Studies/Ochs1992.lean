# Ochs (1992): Indexing Gender

This file formalizes the model of indirect indexicality in [ochs-1992]. Few features of
language index gender directly and exclusively; linguistic forms directly index stances,
acts, and activities, and these in turn help to constitute gender, so the relation of
language to gender is non-exclusive, constitutive, and mediated. The Japanese sentence-final
particles of [uyeno-1971] are the running example: *ze* directly indexes coarse intensity
and *wa* delicate intensity, and the affective dispositions so indexed are part of the
preferred images of men and women. The two steps are association fields, from form to stance
(`formStance`) and from stance to gender (`stanceGender`), and the indirect form–gender
association is their product (`composed`), an index of the second order in the sense of
[silverstein-2003]. *ze* indexes masculinity more than femininity and *wa* the reverse, through
the stances alone, and both particles carry a positive association with both genders, the
non-exclusivity that follows from every stance being available to both sexes.

## Implementation notes

The form-to-stance map is categorical, and the stance-to-gender strengths are two parameters,
the strength `a` with which a stance indexes the gender whose preferred image it belongs to
and the strength `b` with which it indexes the other, the chapter fixing only that both are
positive and that `a` exceeds `b`; the theorems assume no more. The third property of the
chapter, that the relation is temporally transcendent, is not represented.
