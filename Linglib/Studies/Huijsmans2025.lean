# Huijsmans (2025): Timing of evidence and epistemic modal claims

This file formalizes [huijsmans-2025]'s account of the ʔayʔaǰuθəm future clitic *səm* and
inferential *č̓ɛ* and of English *will* and *must* as strong epistemic necessity modals that
differ in a presupposition on the timing of the evidence. The modal base is a set of
propositions each with an earliest moment at which it holds (`IsEarliest`); *səm* and *will*
presuppose that every modal-base proposition holds before the earliest moment of the
prejacent (`FuturePresup`), *č̓ɛ* that at least one holds at or after it
(`InferentialPresup`), and *must* presupposes nothing. Where the earliest moments exist, the
two presuppositions are complementary (`futurePresup_iff_not_inferentialPresup`), which is
the distribution of Section 4: contexts with all the evidence in place before the prejacent
take *səm* and *will*, and contexts with evidence arising at or after it take *č̓ɛ*, with
*must* felicitous in both. An empty modal base falsifies the inferential's presupposition
(`not_inferentialPresup_empty`), the prediction the paper checks against the cat that has
gone missing.

The rival analysis in terms of an evidence acquisition time relates that time to the event
time on the library's `Tense.Evidential.EvidentialFrame`. Evidence that has become true can
be acquired only afterwards, so the inferential's presupposition entails downstream evidence
(`downstream_of_inferentialPresup`); the converse fails, and the contexts where the speaker
learns of rain or of a night's clam-digging after the wetting or the cold are the wedge:
the modal-base timing licenses *will*, and the acquisition timing does not
(`felipe_future`, `felipe_not_eatFuture`).

## Implementation notes

* The earliest moment of a proposition is taken in the evaluation world rather than in a
  maximally similar one, and the modal-base propositions are already shifted to untensed
  ones, so the reference-time index and the abstraction rule are not represented.
* The contexts of Section 4 are stated by the onset times of the eventualities, following
  the remark that a proposition describing an eventuality holds forever after it; the at-issue
  content is Kratzer necessity over the best worlds with the non-past orientation of the
  future morphemes.
