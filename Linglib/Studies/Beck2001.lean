# Reciprocals are definites

Formalization of [beck-2001] (NLS 9). *Each other* uniformly denotes "the other ones
among them" — an anaphoric plural definite recasting [heim-lasnik-may-1991] — and a
reciprocal sentence is a special kind of relational plural. The paper admits exactly
four semantic readings — collective, Strong Reciprocity, Weak Reciprocity, and
situation-based WR — tracking the readings of relational plurals. The other
interpretations of the [dalrymple-et-al-1998] survey are not semantic: Partitioned SR
and One-way WR are cover effects ([schwarzschild-1996] subgroups and exceptions),
Intermediate Reciprocity is situation-based WR under a subsituation context (§5), and
Inclusive Alternative Ordering is left underived, a lexical process limited to
spatio-temporal relations (§6.3).

## Main definitions

* `otherOnesAmongThem` — the HLM definite ((76)), in its singularity-parts case.
* `CollectiveReading` — predication of the reciprocal group itself ((84)).
* `SituationWeakReciprocity` — WR with cumulation over the situation argument ((193),
  bivalent, singleton covers).

## Main results

* `strongReciprocity_iff_otherOnes`, `collectiveReading_iff_strong` — SR is double
  distribution over the definite ((81)); with a distributive relation the collective
  schema collapses into SR.
* `situationWR_imp_weakReciprocity` — under persistence, situation-based WR entails
  WR: the right edge of the entailment chain SR → sitWR → WR feeding the Strongest
  Meaning Hypothesis ((219), fn. 15).

The six-scheme entailment lattice ((28)) and the WR-as-cumulation identity ((120),
`weakReciprocity_iff_cumulative_strict`) live in `Plurality/Reciprocal.lean` and are
consumed here. The convergence with [haug-dalrymple-2020] on presuppositional
distinctness is housed in `Studies/HaugDalrymple2020.lean` (the later paper draws the
comparison); the trivalent divergence from [sternefeld-1998] in
`Studies/Sternefeld1998.lean`.

/-! ### The HLM definite -/

/-- The reciprocal's denotation ((76)): "the other ones among them" — the maximal
    subgroup of the antecedent `A` not overlapping the contrast argument `x`. In the
    singularity-parts case (distinctness = non-identity, p. 92) this is `A.erase x`;
    the full (76) routes through Sharvy maximality and Link `*`, with non-overlap
    replacing non-identity when covers contain genuine subgroups ((78)). -/
def otherOnesAmongThem (A : Finset α) (x : α) : Finset α :=
  A.erase x

/-- The definite excludes the contrast argument. -/
theorem otherOnesAmongThem_excludes (A : Finset α) (x : α) :

/-- The definite is a subgroup of the antecedent. -/
theorem otherOnesAmongThem_subset (A : Finset α) (x : α) :
    otherOnesAmongThem A x ⊆ A :=
  Finset.erase_subset x A

/-- On a plural antecedent the definite is defined (nonempty) at every member — the
    plurality presupposition ((115), §4.3.1). -/

/-- SR is double distribution over the definite ((81)): distribute over the
    antecedent, then over "the other ones among them". -/

/-- The collective reading ((84)): the relation holds of each member and the
    reciprocal group itself, with no distribution over that group — "the forks are
    propped against each other". -/
def CollectiveReading (R : α → Finset α → Prop) (A : Finset α) : Prop :=
  ∀ x ∈ A, R x (otherOnesAmongThem A x)

/-- With a relation that distributes to members, the collective schema is exactly SR:

/-! ### Situation-based Weak Reciprocity

(120)'s bivalent collapse — WR is `**` of the strict-distinct relation — is the
substrate theorem `weakReciprocity_iff_cumulative_strict`, shared with
[sternefeld-1998]'s (26b); the two analyses differ only trivalently, where
[sternefeld-1998] asserts distinctness and [beck-2001] presupposes it ((113), the
distinct-subgroups effect of §4.3.2). What remains of the paper's own reading
inventory is the situation layer. -/

variable {σ : Type*}

/-- Situation-based WR ((193), bivalent, singleton covers): every relevant
    subsituation contains a distinct pair in the relation, and every member
    participates in some relevant subsituation, in each direction. -/
def SituationWeakReciprocity (R : α → α → σ → Prop) (A : Finset α)
    (subs : Finset σ) : Prop :=
  (∀ s ∈ subs, ∃ x ∈ A, ∃ y ∈ A, x ≠ y ∧ R x y s) ∧
    (∀ x ∈ A, ∃ s ∈ subs, ∃ y ∈ A, x ≠ y ∧ R x y s) ∧
      (∀ y ∈ A, ∃ s ∈ subs, ∃ x ∈ A, x ≠ y ∧ R x y s)

/-- Under persistence — what holds in a subsituation holds in the evaluation
    situation — situation-based WR entails WR at the evaluation situation: the right
    edge of the entailment chain SR → sitWR → WR that feeds the paper's Strongest
    Meaning Hypothesis ((219), fn. 15). -/
