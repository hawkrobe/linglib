# Močnik and Abramovitz (2019): a variable-force variable-flavor attitude verb in Koryak

[mocnik-abramovitz-2019] document the Koryak attitude verb *ivək*, translated 'say' out of
context, which also means 'think' and 'allow for the possibility that'. It varies in force and
in flavor, against the universal of [nauze-2008] that a modal varies on one axis only.

Their entry (15) quantifies universally over the worlds a subset selection function picks from
a domain, after [rullmann-matthewson-davis-2008], and closes the function existentially over a
cover that the context resolves either to the identity, the default, or to all nonempty
selections (`Cover`). The identity cover gives the box over the domain and the full cover the
diamond (`Frame.ivek_identity_iff`, `Frame.ivek_all_iff`), so the force varies with the cover.
A modal-base-like variable sets the domain to the holder's belief worlds or to the worlds
compatible with what the holder says (`Flavor`), so the flavor varies with it. The two are
independent parameters, and the entry's force-flavor pairs are the product of two forces and
two flavors (`meaning_eq`), varying on both axes (`not_singleAxis_meaning`). The pairs the
paper attests vary on both axes too (`not_singleAxis_attested`).

The cover accounts for the conjunctions of §2. *ivək* of two incompatible complements is
contradictory on the identity cover (`Frame.not_ivek_identity_and`) and consistent on the full
cover (`Frame.ivek_all_and_iff`), the contrast between the necessity and possibility readings
of (6) and (8a). The felicitous reading of (8b) is the negated box, and its full-cover reading
is the one on which the ball is neither white nor black (`Frame.ex8b_all_iff`), false in the
context of (8) (`Frame.ex8b_all_false`). The flavor accounts for §3: the two *ivək*s of (14),
set apart by an adverb, are consistent on different flavors (`ex14_consistent`), while one
*ivək* over clauses that contradict each other, (20), is false on every reading
(`Frame.not_ivek_and_not`). On the doxastic flavor and the identity cover *ivək* is the
non-veridical *believe* of [hintikka-1962] (`Frame.ivek_doxastic_identity_iff_holdsAt`).

## Implementation notes

* The entry's domain is a set of worlds; here it is the set accessible from the evaluation
  world by the holder's belief or sayings relation.
* (13) writes the second colour of (8b) as the negation of the first, which makes its
  full-cover reading contradictory in every context. The prose reading, that the ball is half
  white and half black, needs the two colours as separate predicates, and so they are here.
* `attested` leaves out the existential 'say' of footnote 10, which the paper could not
  confirm and the entry predicts (`attested_ssubset_meaning`).

## TODO

* §4: the bouletic readings, split at LF into the doxastic *ivək* and an item in the embedded
  clause, the counterfactual mood (23) and the covert *des* (26), over the information-state
  index of [yalcin-2007].
