# A typology of noun categorization devices

Aikhenvald's typology individuates classifier types by their morphosyntactic locus and
scope, the definitional parameters (A)–(G) of the book's first chapter, and then reads the
contingent parameters — interaction with other categories, preferred semantics, evolution,
acquisition — as correlates of the types so established. The types are focal points on a
continuum rather than discrete classes, and most generalizations are tendencies with listed
exceptions. Here the book's parameters are functions on a sample of seven languages
(`Language`), the French and Italian gender systems, the Xhosa, Shona and Swahili noun-class
systems, and the Mandarin and Japanese numeral-classifier systems, coded as the book describes
them, with the kind of each device derived from its locus and the constituent it characterizes
rather than stored and the realizations of the classifier languages read off their fragments'
entries; the book's summary claims are checked on that sample, and none is a universal.
Western Armenian, whose numerals combine with bare nouns, is not classified as a classifier
language by the book and is left to `BaleKhanjian2014`.

## Main results

* `nounClass_agreement_obligatory`, `nounClass_bound`: a noun class system is defined by agreement
  outside the noun, is closed and obligatory, and is never expressed by free lexemes.
* `free_numeralClassifier_no_agreement`: free-form numeral classifiers do not agree.
* `numeralClassifier_obligatory`: in both classifier languages no noun that takes a classifier is
  counted without one, read off the fragments.
* `classifier_assignment_semantic`: every kind other than noun class assigns classifiers on
  semantic grounds.
* `numeralClassifier_general`: both numeral-classifier systems have a general classifier, every
  Mandarin noun that takes a classifier taking *gè* and the category of Japanese *-tsu* having no
  parameter in Downing's inventory.
* `animacy_basic`, `numeralClassifier_shape`, `colour_never`: animacy, humanness or sex is basic
  to noun classes and numeral classifiers, shape is typical of numeral classifiers, and colour is
  never a basis for categorization.
* `numeralClassifier_no_obligatory_number`: numeral-classifier languages lack compulsory number,
  Greenberg's association, which the book records with its Dravidian, Nivkh, Algonquian, Tucano,
  Arawak and Ejagham exceptions.

numeral classifiers it is read off the earlier descriptions: a Mandarin classifier every counted
