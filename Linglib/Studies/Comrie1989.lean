# Comrie 1989: Language Universals and Linguistic Typology

Three of the book's chapters make claims sharp enough to state. Case marking (chapter 6) serves
first to discriminate the two arguments of a transitive clause: of the five ways the primitives
S, A and P can share cases, only the nominative–accusative and ergative–absolutive systems keep
A and P apart with two cases, which is why those two are the widespread ones, the tripartite
system spending a case on a distinction it does not need and the neutral and the A/P-against-S
systems failing to make the one that matters. The same function explains differential marking:
the agent of a transitive clause is typically more animate and more definite than its patient,
so marking is spent on the departures, a P high on the hierarchies or an A low on them, and
each language's marking is monotone in prominence, Russian and Polish by animacy, Turkish and
Persian by definiteness, Hindi and Spanish by both, Dyirbal marking its As downward and its Ps
upward from the same cut between first and second person pronouns and the rest of the animacy
hierarchy.

In causatives (chapter 8) the causee takes the highest position on the hierarchy subject >
direct object > indirect object > oblique that the base verb's arguments leave free, as Turkish
shows for intransitive, transitive and ditransitive bases; languages may in addition double a
filled position, Sanskrit a direct object and Turkish an indirect object, or demote further
than required, French by *par*, and the analysis of the oblique causee as a passive fails for
Turkish, where passive applies to every transitive verb but the oblique causee only to
ditransitive bases, and for Hungarian, which has an oblique causee and no passive expressing
its agent in that case. Where a language offers two cases for the causee, the one lower on
the hierarchy encodes the causee that retains more control, Hungarian instrumental over
accusative, Japanese dative over accusative, Kannada instrumental over dative; and within a
language the more compact a causative's form, the more direct the causation it expresses.
Subject (chapter 5) is a prototype, the intersection of agent and topic, so that constructions
tied to agents, such as imperative addressee deletion, group S with A even in Dyirbal,
constructions tied to affected participants, such as the Nivkh resultative, group S with P,
both as tendencies, and constructions tied to neither, such as coordination, vary: S with A in
English, S with P in Dyirbal, neither in Chukchi.

The case systems are the equivalence relations on the three primitives, `caseSystem_of_equivalence`
that the five are all of them and `discriminates_two_case_iff` that two of them are the
economical discriminating ones; the book's examples are the rows, over which `marking_monotone`
is the information-flow prediction, `causee_rows` and `passive_analysis_fails` the hierarchy
against its rival, `control_rows` the control hierarchy, `compactness_rows` the directness
correlation through the substrate's monotonicity, and `bias_rows`, `coordination_rows` and
`mixed_rows` the prototype's predictions.

## Implementation notes

* A marking row records, for each argument the book discusses, the scales the book invokes
  for that language and the marking its position takes, obligatory, optional or none;
  monotonicity is read over pairs of acceptable rows of one language and role in the product
  order of the substrate's fine-grained animacy hierarchy, which places the first and second
  person pronouns above other humans as the book does, and its definiteness scale, a scale the
  row does not cite constraining nothing. A row whose marking the book attributes to a
  parameter beside the hierarchies, Polish's male-human cut, carries a `parameter` feature and
  has no marking.
* The departures from the paradigm case are per-language parameters: which positions a
  language doubles, whether it demotes further than required, and whether it has a passive,
  the last consulted only by the rival analysis and stated by the book for Turkish, French and
  Hungarian; Sanskrit's and Kannada's passives are textbook facts.
* The prototype's predictions are stated through the bias of a construction type, agent-linked
  or patient-linked, which the book gives as the explanation; a control complement, the
  Chukchi infinitive construction, favours S with A on the book's account, and coordination
  has no bias.

## TODO

* The book's four-grade definiteness continuum, complete identifiability > definite superset >
  discourse relevance > neither, is coarsened onto the substrate's scale, which merges the
  middle two grades; Persian (23) and Turkish (25) are therefore indefinite specific.
* The book says Sanskrit has no dative causee at all, a position the hierarchy skips; the
  parameters record only doubling and further demotion, and no row tests the gap.
* The doubling universal of §8.2, that the possibilities for doubling increase down the
  hierarchy, needs more languages than the book's rows give.
* Chapter 9's animacy hierarchy is prose here: the Navajo *yi-* ~ *bi-* alternation, Chukchi
  number and the Tangut and Southern Tiwa agreement data would need agreement substrate.
* The Russian numeral continuum of §5.2 and Greenberg's Universal 38 on the unmarkedness of the
  S case (§6.1) are not stated.
