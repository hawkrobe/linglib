# Yang (2016): The Price of Linguistic Productivity

This file formalizes the Tolerance Principle of [yang-2016]: a rule applicable to `N` items
is productive only if its exceptions number at most `N / ln N` (`threshold`, `tolerates`).
The principle is derived from the cost of rule access under the Elsewhere Condition, in the
form first given in [yang-2005]. The `N` items are ranked by frequency and searched serially,
so under a Zipfian distribution the expected time to reach an item in a list of `N` is
`N / H_N`, with `H_N` the harmonic number (`listTime`). A productive rule lists its `M`
exceptions before the rule, so an exception is found in expected time `T(M, M)` and a
regular item after all `M` exceptions have been rejected (`ruleTime`); listing everything
costs `T(N, N)`, and the rule is productive when the former does not exceed the latter
(`Productive`). Since the rule's cost never exceeds `M` (`ruleTime_le`), any rule with at
most `N / H_N` exceptions is productive (`productive_of_le_listTime`), hence any rule with at
most `N / (1 + ln N)` exceptions (`productive_of_le_div_one_add_log`); the threshold of the
principle replaces the harmonic number by the logarithm it approximates. The German
feminine plural, with some eighty exceptions among at least five hundred nouns, is tolerated
(`tolerates_500_80`).

## Implementation notes

Yang's simplification of the rule's cost, that a random subset of a Zipfian list is again
Zipfian, is taken as the definition of `ruleTime`. The threshold is stated with the natural
logarithm as in the book, and its relation to the exact harmonic bound is recorded by the
sufficiency theorems rather than by the book's approximate solution of `T(N, N) = T(N, M)`.
Mathlib's convention that division by zero is zero makes the threshold vanish at `N ≤ 1`.
