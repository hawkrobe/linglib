# Krifka (2013): Definitional Generics

This file formalizes [krifka-2013]'s distinction between descriptive and definitional generic
sentences. *Madrigals are popular* generalizes about the world; *A madrigal is polyphonic* says
how the word *madrigal* is to be interpreted, which is why an accidental property makes an
indefinite-singular generic odd (*#A madrigal is popular*). Meaning depends on two indices, an
interpretation and a world, and a common ground pairs a set of admissible interpretations with
a set of worlds (`CommonGround`). A descriptive update keeps the interpretations and discards
worlds (`descUpdate`); a definitional update keeps the worlds and discards interpretations
(`defUpdate`), and with a topic-comment structure it restricts only the interpretation of the
definiendum (`defUpdateTopic`). Two further claims are theorems: admissible interpretations
stay convex under a definitional update whose proposition is convex in the interpretation
(`ordConnected_defUpdate`), and a definitional generic can rest on an empirical finding: once
a species rule ties the chromosome number to being a donkey, the descriptive update with
Chiquita's count leaves the definitional update with *A donkey has 62 chromosomes* nothing to
do (`defUpdateTopic_descUpdate`).

## Implementation notes

* Common grounds carry finite sets so that the paper's models are decided, and the updates
  take decidable propositions.
* The species rule is stated per interpretation; the chromosome count is a measure and so the
  same under every interpretation; and Chiquita, a specimen, is a donkey under every admissible
  interpretation.
* The paper's data are in `Data/Examples/Krifka2013.json`. The correlation of subject form
  with reading, which the paper leaves as a tendency, is not formalized.

## TODO

* The paper's definitional update with *Feynman is tall* and *Teller is not tall* is meant to
  leave the middle standard, but with the heights it lists Teller is tall under that standard in
  the first world, so the update as printed leaves no standard; the descriptive update with
  *Feynman is tall* is computed instead.
