# Sag et al. (2020): Lessons from the English Auxiliary System

This file formalizes the paper's constructional analysis of subject-auxiliary inversion. The
aux-initial construction requires the head daughter of a clause to be an invertible finite
auxiliary, a word marked `[INV +]`, and says nothing about meaning: following Fillmore, the
aux-initial clauses share no semantics, and each kind of aux-initial clause gets its meaning
from the clausal type it cross-classifies with, the polar interrogative from the
interrogative clauses and the aux-initial exclamative from the exclamative clauses. So the
construction is one principle over the RSRL construct hierarchy of
`Syntax/HPSG/Construction` (`auxInitialPrinciple`), the two clauses are sorts below both the
aux-initial construction and a clausal type (`sai_cross_classify`), and a worked construct of
either sort satisfies the grammar exactly when its head is inverted and its mother carries the
clausal type's semantics (`polarInterrogative_models`, `auxInitialExclamative_models`). A
polar interrogative is built directly by its construction rather than derived from an
uninverted clause, which is why the auxiliary puzzle of structure dependence never arises.

## Implementation notes

The construction's valence conditions, that the head daughter's valents are its sisters and
the mother is valence-saturated, are not in the RSRL signature and are not modelled; only the
`[INV +]` head is. The remaining constructions of the paper, the inflectional and negation
constructions and contraction, are not formalized.
