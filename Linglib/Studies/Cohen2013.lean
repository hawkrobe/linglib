# Cohen (2013): No quantification without reinterpretation

A generic or habitual sentence contains no audible quantifier, so the hearer must
introduce one by reinterpreting the quantifierless input, and the introducing device —
not a phonologically null determiner — fixes the quantifier's scope. Generics arise by
Nunberg's Predicate Transfer: when predicating a property of a kind makes no pragmatic
sense, the predicate is transferred to one true of a kind whose instances generically
bear it. Pragmatic triggering leaves the transfer free to apply at any level of
composition, after Nunberg and Recanati, so "Storks have a favorite nesting area" is
scopally ambiguous — transfer of the verb leaves the generic under the existential,
transfer of the whole phrase puts it above (§13.4.1) — though never out of an opaque
context, since transfer needs the property's intension. Habituals arise by a type-shift: an eventive verb is evaluated at
intervals while the present tense supplies a moment (after Taylor and Dowty), and the
shift γ resolves the mismatch at the verb, before the object composes, so "Mary smokes a
cigarette" keeps the generic under the existential and is odd, while the brand variant is
fine (§13.4.2). That a type-shift applies only at its trigger site is argued from Partee
and Rooth's SHIFT: negating a shifted verb differs from shifting a negated one, and only
the first order is attested (§13.3.1, after the conjunction *needed but didn't buy*).
Scope alone also does not exhaust the generic–negation interaction: focus fixes the
alternative set of Cohen's earlier generic quantifier, so "Cows do not eat [nettles]"
generalizes with exceptions while "Cows do [not] eat nettles" denies that any cow eats
them (§13.2.1).

We state the two devices with the generic quantifier of `Studies/Cohen1999.lean` in the
transferred and shifted predicates, derive both scopes of the storks sentence from the
transfer's freedom of level and the infelicity of the cigarette sentence from the shift's
locality, and check the focus readings of the nettles sentence against the two
alternative sets.

## Implementation notes

The generic quantifier inside the reinterpretation operators is the absolute reading
with trivial alternatives, per the chapter's own pointer to Cohen's earlier work for its
content. Kinds are `Unit`, individuals and intervals `Fin n`; a felicity judgment is
derived as the absence of a true reading among the available ones.

## TODO

* Bare plurals under habituals ((18): gen above the existential only) follow from bare
  plurals introducing no discourse referent, a duplex condition under an existential
  being no well-formed DRS (after Cohen and Erteschik-Shir); this needs the DRT box
  substrate.
* Predicate Transfer's ban on scoping out of opaque contexts (§13.4.1) rests on its need
  for the property's intension, which these extensional models cannot state.
* The wide-scope generic objects of (19)–(20), which refute a syntactic account
  (§13.2.3), presuppose a subject–object asymmetry not encoded here.

Two storks, each nesting in its own area. Transfer at the verb quantifies each area's
candidate nesters, transfer at the phrase quantifies the storks' own areas: the readings
differ in truth value, and both are available to Predicate Transfer, so the sentence is
scopally ambiguous and true on one reading. -/

/-! ### Mary smokes a cigarette (§13.4.2)

Three occasions in the interval around the speech moment, a different cigarette each
time. The type mismatch sits at the eventive verb, so γ may apply only there, leaving
the existential above the generic; that sole available reading is false, which is the
oddness of (17a)/(45). The brand variant (17b) is the same shift with a constant
witness, so its narrow reading is true and the sentence is fine. -/

/-! ### Cows do not eat nettles (§13.2.1)

Five cows, one a nettle-eater. With focus on the object, the alternatives are the ways
of eating and the generic scopes over negation: cows in general eat something other than
nettles, exceptions tolerated ((9a)). With focus on the auxiliary, the scope is its own
sole alternative, the generic is the trivially true refutation reading, and the negated
sentence denies that any cow eats nettles — false here ((9b)). -/
