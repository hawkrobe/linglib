# Nadathur (2023)

Nadathur analyses an implicative as Karttunen's presupposition–proposition pair with causal
conditions, her Proposal (32). The verb presupposes that its prerequisite is causally necessary
for the complement and, if it is two-way, causally sufficient, both relative to a background
situation, and it asserts the prerequisite. Under this causal reading of the conditions
(`causalReading`), which is sound at every context of the background, the complement entailments
of Karttunen's schemas carry over.

In her Dreyfus scenario, an eight-vertex causal model, the nerve that *dare* names is causally
necessary and sufficient for sending the message, so *dare* is felicitous there and its assertion
and denial decide the message (`dare_felicitous_for_msg`, `msg_of_dare`, `not_msg_of_not_dare`).
The nerve is necessary but not sufficient for establishing communication and for spying, so *dare*
is infelicitous there (`dare_infelicitous_for_com`, `dare_infelicitous_for_spy`). The paper's
Finnish implicatives fall under Karttunen's schemas, which the Finnish fragment's entries carry
(`implicative_eq`), and each of the paper's minimal pairs entails what its schema commits the
speaker to (`rows_agree`).

## Implementation notes

A fact is a variable with a value, and the worlds of the causal reading are the contexts where the
background holds; the reading needs the context to reach the model only at its roots, as in the
paper's dynamics. The sufficiency verdicts are decided over the finite model; the necessity
verdicts are proved through the equations, which make every path to the effect run through the
nerve.

Definition 10b ranges over the consistent supersituations of Definition 9b
(`IsConsistentSupersituation`), and over them the verdicts on (34c) and (34d) fail: settling the
message, which the background leaves open, reaches communication without the nerve
(`Consistent.not_nrv_necessary_for_com`). The paper argues those verdicts from the background
variables alone, so necessity is read over the exogenous settlements, a subset of the consistent
supersituations (`isConsistentSupersituation_of_isExogenousSettlement`).

## TODO

The *manage* examples need set-valued prerequisites, one of them the
conjunction of courage, a listener, and an ungarbled message, while the substrate's
sufficiency semantics takes a single prerequisite vertex.
