# Wilder (2013): English emphatic *do*

This file formalizes [wilder-2013]'s analysis of emphatic *do*. The auxiliary appears wherever
Affix Hopping cannot attach Tense to the verb, and emphatic assertion is one such case: the
polarity head Σ of [laka-1990] holding the affirmative morpheme intervenes between Tense and the
verb just as negation does, so emphatic *do* has the syntax of *do*-support under negation. The
emphasis itself is focus on Σ, polarity focus, whose alternatives are the proposition and its
negation, the alternatives of the polar question the sentence answers. Under
[schwarzschild-1999]'s Givenness the existential F-closure of a clause with F-marked Σ is a
tautology, so any salient antecedent makes the clause Given, and the requirement that the
antecedent be a negated or modalised version of the proposition falls on the unfocused subject
and verb phrase instead. Emphatic *do* sentences come in two types. A Verum-focus sentence has no
accent beyond focus accents and occurs in every finite clause type. A contrastive-topic sentence
has, on its subject, verb phrase or object, the fall-rise accent that [buring-2003] analyses as
indicating a strategy of questions, and it occurs only as a root declarative or a complement of
the *believe* type. Wilder derives the restriction from the hypothesis that a contrastive-topic
sentence with emphatic *do* directly answers a polar question of the strategy: such an answer can
be embedded under *believe* or *appear*, but not as an interrogative or factive complement, a
cleft, a relative or an adverbial clause, and a contrastive-topic sentence that answers a
constituent question rejects *do* altogether.

## Main definitions

* `Clause`, `AffixHopping`, `DoSupport`, `EmphaticDo`: the auxiliary system of section 2.
* `polarityFocus`: F-marking of Σ, with the polarity alternatives of the proposition.
* `existentialClosure`, `Given`: Schwarzschild's existential F-closure and Givenness.
* `DirectlyAnswersPolar`: the hypothesis (112) on the strategy a contrastive topic indicates.
* `Row`, `rows`: the paper's judgments on the two sentence types across clause types.

## Main results

* `emphaticDo_iff`: emphatic *do* is *do*-support forced by an affirmative Σ alone.
* `doSupport_negative_iff_positive`: negation and emphatic assertion strand Tense alike.
* `polarityFocus_alternatives_eq_alt_polar`: the alternatives of polarity focus are those of the
  polar question.
* `given_polarityFocus`: a clause with F-marked Σ is Given after any antecedent.
* `not_admits_polarityFocus_of_constituentQuestion`: a constituent question does not admit
  polarity focus, so a contrastive-topic sentence answering one rejects *do*.
* `doctorStrategy_isComplete`: the strategy a contrastive-topic verb phrase indicates is complete
  when its subquestions decide the superquestion.
* `ct_acceptable_iff_hostsYesAnswer`: across the embedding environments, a contrastive-topic
  sentence with emphatic *do* is acceptable exactly where a Yes-answer can be embedded.

## Implementation notes

* `Clause` keeps only the heads of the clause structure (3) that decide Affix Hopping; an
  auxiliary in T stands for *have*, *be* or a modal, and Σ carries its polarity and whether it is
  F-marked. Wilder's claim that unfocused emphatic *do* is unacceptable rather than ungrammatical
  is not encoded.
* The contrastive-topic accent is recorded as a feature of an example row, not composed; the
  strategy it indicates is a `Discourse.Strategy`, and the hypothesis (112) is membership of the
  polar question among its nodes.
* The Yes-answer environments of (126) and (127) are rows like the emphatic *do* judgments, so
  `ct_acceptable_iff_hostsYesAnswer` compares two tables the paper gives independently. The
  wh-subject question and object preposing rows are outside that comparison: the paper explains
  them by the incompatibility of contrastive topic with questions and by a clash of strategies.

## TODO

* The optionality of *do* in contrastive-topic sentences (section 7) and the Givenness of the
  subject and verb phrase under composition (section 4.2) are not formalized; the latter is what
  the antecedents of section 4.1, an asserted, presupposed or modalised negation and the negation
  of a parallel predication, constrain.
