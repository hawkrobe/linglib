# Moroney (2021): definiteness and quantification in Shan

Moroney shows that Shan (Southwestern Tai) bare nouns express both unique and anaphoric
definiteness, instantiating an unmarked cell that Jenks's definiteness typology had no slot for.
Because Shan has no articles, no covert type-shift is blocked — ι, ι^x and ∩ are all available to
bare nouns — while the optional demonstratives *nâj/nân* only add spatial content. The cell is
derived from `Shan.Determiners.inventory`, the bare-noun readings as the shifts the inventory leaves
unblocked that are maximal under Dayal's Meaning Preservation, her (79), and the refutation is
stated against `Jenks2018.attested`.

Her comparison of Shan and English bare nouns (Table 2.3) finds them alike on the low-scope
existential, kind and generic readings, alike in lacking a high-scope existential, and different
only on the definite reading; that difference is derived here (`shan_iota_english_none`) rather than
tabulated. On the mass/count side she adopts Deal's generalized homogeneity — a predicate is
g-homogeneous when it is cumulative and, among other options, lacks minimal parts — and argues that
Shan count nouns, like English *furniture*, are cumulative but have identifiable atomic parts
(`maa_cumulative_not_divisive`). The demonstratives are the definite with the referent's closeness
to the speaker added: *nâj* presupposes a unique `P` in the situation and refers to it if it is
close (`demDenotation`, her (147)–(148)).

## Implementation notes

Moroney leaves close.to.speaker and far.from.speaker primitive. Here a demonstrative's spatial
content is the vicinity of a referent whose participants form one of its participant sets, as in
Harbour's account of spatial deixis: *nâj* covers the sets containing the speaker and *nân* the
others, so close.to.speaker is the vicinity of a referent including the speaker
(`mem_image_naj_iff`) and far.from.speaker the vicinity of one excluding the speaker
(`mem_image_nan_iff`). Where she treats far.from.speaker as the opposite of close.to.speaker, the
two vicinities may overlap here, as when the addressee stands by the speaker.

/-- With a non-kind predicate a Shan bare noun type-shifts by ι, the definite reading, while an
English bare singular has no shift available at all, since *the* blocks ι and ι^x, *a* blocks ∃,
and ∩ is undefined for a singular count noun. -/

selected beside ι, so Shan bare nouns default to definite or kind readings and the existential
reading arises only through existential closure at vP, whence the missing high-scope
existential. -/
