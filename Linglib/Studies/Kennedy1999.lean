# Kennedy (1999): Projecting the Adjective

Kennedy argues that gradable adjectives denote measure functions from objects to extents on a
scale. The positive extent of an object, (30), runs from the bottom of the scale up to its
measure, and the negative extent, (31), from its measure to the top, so the antonymy
biconditional (54) follows from the complementarity of the two. Positive and negative extents are
disjoint sorts, so a comparison between them is undefined, which explains cross-polar anomaly
alongside incommensurability (section 3.1.7).

## Main results

* `Kennedy1999.antonymy_biconditional`: (54), *a is taller than b* iff *b is shorter than a*, on
  the extents of (30) and (31).
* `Kennedy1999.comparison_defined_iff`: a subdeletion comparative is acceptable exactly when the
  compared extents are of one sort on a shared scale, against the rows of sections 3.1.3–3.1.7.
* `Kennedy1999.measurePhrase_positive_iff`: an absolute measure phrase composes exactly with a
  positive adjective, sections 3.1.8–3.1.9.

## Implementation notes

Extents are the rays `Set.Iic (μ a)` and `Set.Ici (μ a)`, closed at the measure as in (30) and
(31). The embedding of measure functions into Klein's degree-free semantics is
`Degree.delineation_strictly_more_general` in `Semantics/Degree/Hom.lean`.

/-! ### Measure phrases (Sections 3.1.8–3.1.9)

Measure phrases denote bounded extents. On a scale with a minimum the positive extents are
bounded and the negative ones are not, so an absolute construction composing a measure phrase
with a negative adjective is undefined, (69) *My Cadillac is 8 feet long* against (70) *My Fiat
is 5 feet short*; the phrasal comparative (73) *My Fiat is shorter than 8 feet* is the contrast,
its standard derived by applying the adjective to the measure phrase. -/
