# Schlenker, Lamberton & Lamberton (2026): Traveling Shots in Language

This file formalizes the paper's extension of Iconological Semantics to dynamic viewpoints. In
[schlenker-lamberton-2024] a classifier predicate has an iconic component evaluated by projecting
its argument onto signing space from the viewpoint a variable denotes, and a dynamic classifier,
one that moves in signing space, is projected moment by moment along its movement (the paper's
(27)). The paper's problem is relative motion: in ASL a classifier for a static object, a tree or a
pole, can move past the signer to show the object passing a moving character, the traveling shot
of film. With projection from static viewpoints a still object projects to a still classifier, so
such readings are unavailable (`DynProj.eq_of_isStatic`); once a viewpoint is a function from times
and worlds to static viewpoints (29), the movement of the classifier is information about the
movement of the viewpoint (`DynProj.viewpoint_ne`), the character's path in the elicited paradigms
of `Data/Examples/SchlenkerEtAl2026`.

The paper leaves two analyses open. On Analysis I any viewpoint variable may denote a dynamic
viewpoint. On Analysis II only the context-bound variable `π*`, which denotes the dynamic
viewpoint of the context's agent (33), may, and Role Shift, analyzed as overt context shift (34),
abstracts over the agent, time and world of the context (`roleShift`), so that a role-shifted
classifier is projected from the character's moving viewpoint (`roleShift_classifierIcon_iff`).
Under the restrictive theory that free variables are static, a traveling shot therefore needs
Role Shift (`Restrictive.eq_of_free`), and under Role Shift the classifier's movement is the
character's (`roleShift_viewpoint_ne`). How dynamic viewpoints enter [davidson-2015]'s
demonstrational analysis of Role Shift, which has no viewpoints, is left open by the paper.

## Implementation notes

* A viewpoint is any type: the paper's viewpoints carry a Cartesian frame of reference and
  scaling factors, and projection is any function from an object, a static viewpoint, a time and a
  world to a position in signing space, so the geometry of projection is not modeled. The scaling
  of classifier time to evaluation time in (27) is an arbitrary clock from the moments of the
  movement to times, started at the time of evaluation. An object is still when its projection
  from any fixed viewpoint does not change over time.
* Role Shift (34) is composed from the substrate's attitude and temporal shifts of the context,
  which the paper's context triple identifies with the agent, world and time coordinates.
* The elicited paradigms are recorded as rows with the mean judgment on the seven-point scale;
  the paper's inferences about the character's path from the side on which the classifier passes
  are not modeled, since they require the geometry.

/-! ### Projection from dynamic viewpoints (§7) -/

/-- (29): a dynamic viewpoint is a function from times and worlds to the static viewpoints of
[schlenker-lamberton-2024]; the standard viewpoints are the constant ones. -/
def IsStatic (vp : T → W → V) : Prop := ∃ v, vp = fun _ _ ↦ v

/-- (29): projection from a viewpoint that may move. `proj d v t w` is the position in signing
space to which the object `d` projects from the static viewpoint `v` at `t` in `w`; from a dynamic
viewpoint, `d` projects at `t` in `w` from the viewpoint's value there. -/
def projAt (proj : E → V → T → W → S) (d : E) (vp : T → W → V) (t : T) (w : W) : S :=
  proj d (vp t w) t w

/-- (27), (32): an object projects to a dynamic classifier, a function `cl` from the moments of
its movement to positions in signing space, when at each moment, sent to a time of evaluation by
the classifier's clock, the object projects to the classifier's position there. -/
def DynProj (proj : E → V → T → W → S) (d : E) (vp : T → W → V) (w : W) (clock : ι → T)

time. -/

/-! ### Viewpoint variables and Role Shift (§8) -/

/-- A viewpoint variable: the free variables `π_i`, whose values come from the assignment, and
the context-bound variable `π*`, introduced by Role Shift. -/
inductive ViewpointVar where
  | free (i : ℕ)
  | contextBound
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- (33): a free viewpoint variable denotes its value under the assignment `s`; the context-bound
variable `π*` denotes the dynamic viewpoint of the context's agent. -/
def ViewpointVar.denote (s : ℕ → T → W → V) (agentVP : E → T → W → V) (c : Context W E P T) :
    ViewpointVar → T → W → V
  | .free i => s i
  | .contextBound => agentVP c.agent

/-- The restrictive theory of §8: every free viewpoint variable denotes a static viewpoint. -/
def Restrictive (s : ℕ → T → W → V) : Prop := ∀ i, IsStatic (s i)

/-- (34): Role Shift abstracts over the agent, time and world of the context, evaluating its
clause at the shifted context and at that time and world. -/
def roleShift (IP : Context W E P T → T → W → Prop) (c : Context W E P T) (x : E) (t : T)
    (w : W) : Prop :=
  IP (temporalShift t (attitudeShift x w c)) t w

/-- (31), (36): the iconic component of a dynamic classifier with viewpoint variable `π`: its
argument projects to the classifier from the viewpoint `π` denotes, along the clock started at
the time of evaluation. -/

/-- (37c): under Role Shift a classifier with the context-bound variable is projected from the
character's dynamic viewpoint at the shifted time and world. -/
theorem roleShift_classifierIcon_iff (c : Context W E P T) (x : E) (t : T) (w : W) :
    roleShift (classifierIcon s agentVP .contextBound proj d clock' cl) c x t w ↔
      DynProj proj d (agentVP x) w (clock' t) cl := by
  simp [roleShift, classifierIcon, ViewpointVar.denote]

/-- Under the restrictive theory a classifier with a free viewpoint variable cannot show a
still object moving: a traveling shot needs Role Shift. -/
theorem Restrictive.eq_of_free (hs : Restrictive s) (hd : IsStill proj d w) (c : Context W E P T)
    {i : ℕ} (h : DynProj proj d ((ViewpointVar.free i).denote s agentVP c) w clock cl)
    (j k : ι) : cl j = cl k :=
  h.eq_of_isStatic hd (hs i) j k

/-- Under Role Shift the movement of a classifier for a still object is the character's own
movement between the two moments. -/
theorem roleShift_viewpoint_ne (c : Context W E P T) (x : E) (t : T) (hd : IsStill proj d w)
    (h : roleShift (classifierIcon s agentVP .contextBound proj d clock' cl) c x t w) {i j : ι}
    (hij : cl i ≠ cl j) : agentVP x (clock' t i) w ≠ agentVP x (clock' t j) w :=
  ((roleShift_classifierIcon_iff c x t w).1 h).viewpoint_ne hd hij

/-- The paper's illustration of (32): the tree classifier of (30) moves from the front of signing
space to the signer's forehead in one second with temporal scaling factor 100, so if the tree
does not move, Ann's viewpoint at the time of evaluation differs from her viewpoint a hundred
seconds later. -/
