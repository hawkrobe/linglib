# Wang (2023): Honorifics without [HON]

Across Wang's survey the values recruited for honorific pronouns are plural number, third
person and indefiniteness, never singular, first or second person, or definites (Table 1, (28)).
These are the semantically unmarked values, the ones carrying the weakest presupposition (54)–(56),
which the feature bundles order by specification. Recruitment follows from the Taboo of
Directness (57), which in respect contexts demands the weakest presupposition, ranked above Heim's
Maximize Presupposition! (59), which demands the strongest. Number systems with a dual (80) also
need a weak taboo that avoids only the strongest presupposition (82), and the four attested
patterns of honorific nonsingulars are the rankings of (83).

## Main results

* `tod_mp_general`: Taboo » MP! selects the least specified cell alone, so no honorific singular,
  local person or definite arises.
* `stod_mp_wtod`, `wtod_mp_stod`, `wtod_alone`: the rankings of (83) give honorific plural only,
  dual only, and the non-escalating systems.

## Implementation notes

The cells are the number bundles `Number.Features`, singular, dual and plural being the most, the
intermediate and the least specified, the lower sets of the chain minimal < atomic; person and
definiteness bundles have the same shape. The constraints count violations by the size of a
bundle, the taboo as the size itself and MP! as its shortfall from the full bundle. The ternary
tableaux are decided by the kernel. The paper's examples are the rows of
`Data.Examples.Wang2023`.
