# Dinis and Jacinto (2025): A Theory of Marginal and Large Difference

Dinis and Jacinto propose ML theory, eleven axioms on marginally and largely smaller than along a
strict weak order, and give it a measurement theory. Every model is infinite, since a large
difference decomposes into a marginal step and a further large difference, and the theory has no
model on the naturals or the reals, but it has models in nonstandard analysis, where a marginal
difference is an infinitesimal one. Every countable, finitely marginal model maps homomorphically
into the representative model of rational-indexed blocks of integer-indexed locations, and any
two such maps differ by a transformation that rescales blocks and locations within blocks. In a
Sorites whose series is infinite, being bald as not being largely less bald than the last member
makes the premises jointly satisfiable.

## Main statements

* `instIsEmptyMarginalScale`: no conditionally complete order, such as the naturals or the
  reals, carries an ML scale.
* `exists_isHom_lex_rat_int`: every countable, finitely marginal ML scale maps homomorphically
  into the representative model `ℚ ×ₗ ℤ`.
* `heap_iff_bald`: Itzhaki's heaps are exactly what is not largely smaller than a clear case.
* `not_transGen_marginallyLT`: no finite chain of marginal steps leads from someone not bald to
  the last member of a Sorites series.

## Implementation notes

* The project's ML scales are those of [dinis-jacinto-2026], over a linear order with marginally
  smaller than primitive, and the results after the axioms are stated for them; a homomorphism
  then preserves and reflects smaller than and marginally smaller than, and is injective.
* The nonstandard models are mathlib's hyperreals, built from the infinitesimal and the finite
  numbers of [itzhaki-2021]. The finite-difference reading of Dean and Itzhaki (§5, §6), stated
  for nonstandard integers, is taken on the hyperreals.

## TODO

* The arithmetical model `ℑ1` of §3.2 and the model `ℜ` with an initial block of §4.3 need a
  nonstandard model of arithmetic, which mathlib lacks.
