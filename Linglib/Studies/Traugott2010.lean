# Traugott (2010): (Inter)subjectivity and (Inter)subjectification: A Reassessment

This file formalizes Traugott's cline of (inter)subjectivity and its diachronic reading. An
expression is *subjective* when it codes the speaker's attitude or viewpoint, and
*intersubjective* when it codes the speaker's attention to the addressee's self-image. The cline
orders coded meanings from nonsubjective through subjective to intersubjective
(`SubjectivityLevel`). The diachronic claim is that the meanings an item newly codes move up the
cline one level at a time, so that an intersubjective meaning arises from a subjectified one
(`Unidirectional`). It follows that an item with an intersubjective meaning has a subjective one
(`subjective_mem_of_intersubjective_mem`).

The case studies *a piece of*, *a bit of* and *a shred of* run from Partitive through Extended
Partitive to Degree Modifier (`Stage`). The Degree Modifier is the subjectified stage, and it
alone shows all three of the expansions that Himmelmann makes criterial for grammaticalization
(`isGrammaticalized_iff`).

## Implementation notes

* A history records coded meanings only. *A bit of* is used intersubjectively as a hedge but
  codes only the subjective downtoner, so its history stops at the subjective level.
* Earlier and later meanings of an item coexist, which is why a history is a list and not a
  single current level.

/-! ### The cline -/

/-- The levels of the cline of (inter)subjectivity, from least to most subjective. -/
inductive SubjectivityLevel where
  /-- The meaning describes the world or an event. Traugott labels this level as non-subjective
  or less subjective. -/
  | nonSubjective
  /-- The meaning codes the speaker's attitude, belief or evaluation. -/
  | subjective
  /-- The meaning codes the speaker's attention to the addressee's face or self-image. -/
  | intersubjective

/-- The levels are ordered as they are listed. -/
instance : LinearOrder SubjectivityLevel :=
  LinearOrder.lift' SubjectivityLevel.ctorIdx fun a b h ↦ by
    cases a <;> cases b <;> first | rfl | cases h

/-- The levels of an item's coded meanings in the order they arose. -/

/-- A history follows the cline when each newly coded meaning is at the level of the previous
one or at the next level up. -/

/-- An item whose history begins at or below the subjective level and reaches an
intersubjective meaning has a subjective one. -/

/-! ### Partitive to Degree Modifier (section 4) -/

/-- The stages the three case studies share are the Partitive, the Extended Partitive with
non-food and abstract complements, and the Degree Modifier. -/

  deriving DecidableEq, Fintype, Repr

/-- The coded level at each stage. The Extended Partitive's implication that the unit is small
is an invited inference and not yet coded, while the Degree Modifier's scalar meaning is coded
and subjective. -/

  | hostClass
  | syntactic
  | semanticPragmatic
  deriving DecidableEq, Fintype, Repr

/-- The stage at which each expansion first occurs. The complement generalizes at the Extended
Partitive. At the Degree Modifier the string gains a second syntactic analysis, and its first
noun loses partitive meaning and is enriched as a quantifier. -/

occurred. -/
