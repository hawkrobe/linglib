# Chatzikyriakidis & Luo (2020): Formal semantics in modern type theories

In the formal semantics of modern type theories, common nouns are interpreted as types rather than
predicates, and subtyping is coercive: one noun is a subtype of another when a unique coercion
between them may be inserted wherever an object of the second is expected. A noun modified by a
predicate is the Σ-type of its objects satisfying the predicate, a subtype of the noun through
the first projection. This file formalizes the book's classification of adjectival modification,
its operator NOT for the propositional forms of judgements, and its identity criteria for counting.

The book's Theorem 7.1 states that the laws (A1)–(A5) of NOT are provable once NOT is defined from
the heterogeneous equality JMeq. We show that with Lean's heterogeneous equality, which validates
the rules of JMeq, (A1) and (A2) hold but (A3), (A4) and (A5) fail at every proper finite Σ-subtype,
such as the men among the humans. With heterogeneous equality read as equality in a common
carrier, all five laws hold.

## Main definitions

* `sigma A P`: the Σ-type of the objects of `A` satisfying `P`, a subtype of `A` by `sigmaFst A P`.
* `DoesNot A P B b`: the operator NOT, from which `Is` and `Does` define IS and DO.
* `TypeDisjoint A B`: no inhabited noun is a subtype of both `A` and `B`.
* `SubSetoid A B sA sB`: `A` is a subtype of `B` whose identity criterion `sA` is inherited
  from `sB`.

## Main statements

* `range_sigma_comp`: intersective modification meets the noun's extension with the adjective's.
* `not_forall_nonempty_hom_sigma`: subsective modification need not respect subtyping.
* `forall_does_iff_mono`: law (A1) holds on a noun exactly when its embedding is a monomorphism.
* `not_doesNot_comp_heq`, `not_forall_doesNot_of_sub_heq`, `not_exists_doesNot_of_sub_heq`: laws
  (A3), (A4) and (A5) fail for `HEq`.
* `three₀_iff_two_lt_card`: three objects distinct under an identity criterion satisfy a predicate
  exactly when more than two of its identity classes do.

## Implementation notes

* As in [chatzikyriakidis-luo-2017], a noun is an object of `Over Obj`, a type embedded in a type
  `Obj` of all objects, and a coercion is a morphism of `Over Obj`. The book's universe has no such
  `Obj`; here it supplies the heterogeneous equality, under which two objects are equal when their
  images are. This equality identifies an object with its image under a coercion, the axiom that
  [xue-luo-chatzikyriakidis-2018] add to prove (A3)–(A5).
* Coercions are morphisms rather than `Coe` instances, so that statements quantify over nouns.
* By propositional extensionality every modal collection `Prop → Prop` respects logical
  equivalence, the property for which the book rejects the belief contexts of [ranta-1994].

## TODO

* Gradable, multidimensional and adverbial modification.
* Dot-types for copredication, and counting under copredication.
* Negative occurrences (Definition 7.2) and dependent event types.
* A universe without the type `Obj`, with coercions along a directed order.
