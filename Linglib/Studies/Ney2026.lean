# Ney (2026): Insinuative reference and the coordination account

In *insinuative reference* ([ney-2026]) a speaker uses a demonstrative, or another expression
whose meaning must be supplemented in context, so that an innocuous *avowable* referent and a
taboo *unavowed* referent are both possible semantic values; she intends the unavowed one and
keeps the ability to deny it. Ney argues that the unavowed referent is a genuine semantic value
(claim (i)), yet after the utterance it is available from the common ground neither that it is
one (iia) nor that the speaker intended it to be (iib). This challenges the coordination account
of [king-2013], on which a use has `o` as its semantic value iff (A) the speaker intends `o` and
(B) a competent, reasonable, attentive hearer who knows the common ground would recognise that
intention: given that the hearer's reasonableness is common ground (⟨TWO⟩), (B) seems to carry
the intention and the reference into the common ground (⟨THREE⟩, ⟨FOUR⟩). Ney's reply is that
the step needs a hidden premise, ⟨TWO*⟩, that it is common ground that a reasonable hearer would
recognise the intention. Each interlocutor has a *conception of reasonableness*, her beliefs
about which referential intentions every reasonable hearer would recognise; the account's
conception is the intersection of the interlocutors'; and in insinuative reference the
interlocutors share the relevant conception without that being common ground.

Hearers and the intentions they would recognise form a formal context in the sense of
`Mathlib.Order.Concept`: the hearers reasonable by a conception's lights are its `lowerPolar`,
and (B) over a set of hearers is membership in its `upperPolar`. The revised account
(`Model.semanticValues`) quantifies over the hearers reasonable by the lights of at least one
interlocutor, as Ney's revised statement does, and for conceptions closed under recognition this
is the intersection of the conceptions (`Model.semanticValues_eq`); without closure the
intersection formulation is strictly stronger (`exists_mem_upperPolar_iUnion_not_mem`). The
chain is `Model.commonKnowledge_mem_recognized` (⟨TWO⟩ and ⟨TWO*⟩ give ⟨THREE⟩) and
`Model.commonKnowledge_mem_intends` (⟨THREE⟩ contradicts (iib)). The reply is
`Model.not_commonKnowledge_mem_semanticValues` and `Model.not_commonKnowledge_mem_intends`: a
conception that is not common ground blocks (iia), and the speaker's blocks (iib). On a frame
where each interlocutor knows her own conception and nothing about the other's, example (2)
satisfies claim (i), ⟨TWO⟩, (iia) and (iib) together, with the speaker privately believing
that the addressee recognises her intention (`insinuation`). On the same frame, the John Lennon
example, whose referent every conception licenses, reaches the common ground (`lennon`).
Deniability therefore sits in ⟨TWO*⟩ rather than ⟨TWO⟩, which is why denying ⟨TWO⟩, Ney's
rejected first pass, would make the Lennon reference deniable too.

## Implementation notes

A model fixes one use of a supplementive, so a conception of reasonableness restricted to the
use is a set of candidate referents. What King's idealised hearer knows of the common ground,
and the audience properties the common ground attributes to them ([king-2014b], via Ney's
footnote 1), are absorbed into the recognition relation. The common ground is common knowledge
among the interlocutors, the iterated mutual acceptance Ney describes ([stalnaker-2002]), and
accessibility is read as "for all `a` knows", the modality of Ney's reasoning for ⟨TWO*⟩; the
`Filter` common ground of `Discourse.CommonGround` inherits the results through
`Filter.GroundedIn` (`insinuation.not_mem_of_groundedIn`). The speaker's intended referents form
a set, since claim (i) lets avowable referents be semantic values as well. The paper passes from
the intersection of the conceptions to "reasonable by the lights of at least one" with "Thus";
the `IsIntent` field states the closure this step needs, on the reading that a conception's
"implicit and explicit beliefs" include whatever every hearer reasonable by it recognises.

## TODO

Ney's three arguments for claim (i) against reading insinuative reference as indirect speech,
the anaphora argument among them, the dialogue evidence for (iia) and (iib), and the reply
about uptake need an implicature, anaphora and update apparatus; here they are premises. The
distinctions from [camp-2018]'s insinuation and from dogwhistles ([henderson-mccready-2024]) are
not formalized, and the paper's examples are not yet rows of `Data/Examples`.

/-- The intersection formulation ([ney-2026] p. 326) is at least as strong as "reasonable by the
lights of at least one" (p. 327), and strictly stronger for conceptions that are not closed
under recognition: a hearer recognising everything counts as reasonable by either conception
below, a hearer recognising nothing only by their empty intersection. -/

/-! ### The prima facie challenge -/

/-- ⟨TWO⟩ and ⟨TWO*⟩ give ⟨THREE⟩ ([ney-2026] pp. 322, 325): if it is common ground that the
addressee is reasonable and that `o` is a semantic value, it is common ground that the addressee
recognises the intention to refer to `o`. -/

/-! ### The response -/

/-- If it is not common ground that `a`'s conception licenses `o`, it is not common ground that
