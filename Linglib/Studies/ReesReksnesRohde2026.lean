# Rees, Reksnes, and Rohde (2026): Why are you telling me this? The availability and timing of relevance inferences

Rees, Reksnes and Rohde ask why an addressee takes a trivial remark such as *the library walls
are blue* to mean that the walls used to be a different colour. A speaker makes a remark only
when it is worth enough to her, and a quiet speaker's bar is higher. Here the addressee
conditions a prior over whether the situation changed on the pasts in which the speaker would
have spoken; a change can make a trivial remark worth making only to a speaker who knows the
situation over time. Across four experiments the inference is drawn more often for a
knowledgeable speaker and, in the second, for a quiet one. Two verification experiments with
opposite question polarity locate a cost when the inference is endorsed, which the paper
attributes to considering the alternative situation.

## Main statements

* `Speaker.prior_lt_posterior_iff`: speaking raises the probability that the situation changed
  exactly when the remark is trivial on its own and a change would make it worth making.
* `Speaker.posterior_eq_prior_of_not_knowledgeable`: a speaker who does not know the situation
  over time conveys nothing about its past by speaking.
* `Speaker.prior_lt_posterior_of_bar_le`: a quieter speaker licenses whatever a more talkative
  one does, as long as a change would still be worth mentioning to her.
* `ResponseModel.exp3_no_eq_exp4_no`, `AdditiveModel.yes_eq_yes_of_no_eq_no`: if considering the
  alternative is the cost, the *no* answers of the two experiments take equally long, as found;
  separate costs of a negative answer and of the inference could not also give the slower
  inference-endorsing *yes*.

## Implementation notes

Conditioning on the decision to speak is Rohde, Hoek, Keshev and Franke's account of the
listener's expectation, which the paper cites. The speaker speaks exactly when the remark's
worth to her meets her bar, so the model says which inferences are available, not how often
participants draw them. Every item describes a situation that may plausibly have changed. The emphasis cue and the paper's post hoc account of
the interaction in its second experiment are not modelled.
