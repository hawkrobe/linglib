# The incoherent stress of Kuikuro

Formalization of [becker-etal-2025] (NLLT 43). Kuikuro builds iambic feet left to right with
final trochaic reversal; the last foot heads the word, and the primary stress is the head of the
head foot (p. 2365). The paper's title result is that the default High tone does not dock on
this syllable: a tone domain left-aligns to the primary stress of the phrase and expands
rightward up to (but not including) the next foot head — Culminativity-H ((7)), the paper's one
new constraint — so the High target can surface up to three syllables away from the stress it is
a correlate of (§7), dissociating the metrically most prominent syllable from the phonetically
salient one ([gordon-2016]'s incoherence, extended).

## Main definitions

* `fell`, `weFell`, `annatto` — words in isolation (Figs. 1–2, §1) as `Prosody.Tree`s;
  `annattoFell` — the two-word phrase of Fig. 3, with the noun as phrase-head word.
* `toneDomainTail`, `toneTarget` — rightward-maximal tone-domain expansion over a grid: the run
  of unstressed columns after the phrase head, capped before the next foot head and the
  phrase-final syllable ((4)–(7)).

## Main results

* `footing_optimal` — trochaic reversal is OT-optimal under `*V:]φ ≫ Parse-σ ≫ Iamb` ((1)–(3),
  Table 2).
* `isHeaded_*`, `headTerminals_*` — each word's primary stress is its unique head terminal
  (metrical culminativity, [hyman-2006]).
* `toneDomainTail_unstressed` — expansion never admits a stressed syllable: the
  Culminativity-H of ((7)) holds of every predicted domain by construction.
* `tone_coherent_in_isolation`, `stress_tone_incoherence` — in isolation the High target is the
  head terminal itself; in the phrase it is a height-1 syllable three to the right of the peak,
  blocked by the next foot head.

Deferred alongside lexical tone (§5): lexical long vowels (Max-μ, Tables 3–4), word minimality
(§3.5), final shortening (§4.1), and the generality of initial-vowel unparsing (§4.3). Weights:
`1` = short σ, `2` = long σ (iambic lengthening); a foot's `isHead` σ is its head, and the head
foot/word carries `isHead := true`.

the long

/-! ### The trochaic reversal is OT-optimal ([becker-etal-2025] §3.1, Table 2)

Why the final foot reverses to a trochee: an even-parity `/σσσσ/` parsed as two iambs leaves a
**phrase-final long vowel** (`*V:]φ`); leaving the last two σ unparsed violates `Parse-σ`; so they
parse as a trochee, violating only the low-ranked `Iamb`. Ranking `*V:]φ ≫ Parse-σ ≫ Iamb`

/-! ### The tone domain and Culminativity-H ([becker-etal-2025] §4.2)

A phrase carries one High tone. Its domain left-aligns to the primary stress of the phrase
((4)), expands rightward maximally ((5)), excludes the phrase-final syllable ((6)), and stops
before the next foot head — Culminativity-H ((7)): at most one foot head per domain. Over a
grid, expansion takes the run of height-`1` columns after the head column; the High target is
the domain's last syllable. -/

def toneTarget (cols : Grid) (head : ℕ) : ℕ :=

    stressed syllable, so no domain contains a second foot head ((7)). -/

    ∀ h ∈ toneDomainTail cols head, h ≤ 1 := fun _ hh => by
  simpa using List.mem_takeWhile_imp hh

/-- In isolation the tone is coherent: the domain cannot expand — the phrase-final cap ((6))
    closes it at the head — so the High target is the head terminal itself, the default
    penultimate tone of §3. Head indices are visible in `gridColumns_*` above. -/
