# Heim, Lasnik and May (1991): Reciprocity and Plurality

This file formalizes the quantificational analysis of reciprocals in [heim-lasnik-may-1991]:
*each other* decomposes at LF into a distributor, *each*, which moves to the antecedent NP,
and a reciprocator, *e other*, each keeping the semantics of its non-reciprocal use, so that
"the men saw each other" is `[[the men]₁ each₂] saw [e₂ other]₃` ((8), (20)). The pieces
`other` (16), `reciprocator` (18), and `distributor` (19)/(28) compose to `eachOtherLF`,
which is Strong Reciprocity (`eachOtherLF_iff_strongReciprocity`), is vacuous on a
singleton, and is contradictory over an asymmetric relation ((68)). The grain problem of
§3, that (43) is three-ways ambiguous under a single indexing, is resolved by the range and
distribution indices of plural NPs: the four construals of an embedded pronoun (49) yield
the four readings, with the *I* and *you* readings bound variables and the *we* readings
coreference, which a preposed adjunct (60) filters. The scope puzzle of §4 is the attachment
site of *each* (67): narrow scope forces coreference and broad scope a bound variable,
because distributors need sum-denoting hosts and do not iterate (72) and the trace of
*each* must be bound (74).

## Implementation notes

Pluralities are `Finset`s of atoms and proper atomic parthood is membership, matching the
substrate's `Reciprocal`. The reciprocator has universal force, as the paper adopts while
considering groups of two, where universal and existential force coincide; the weaker
schemes for larger groups are [dalrymple-et-al-1998]'s. The grain and scope solutions are
stated over the finite construal and attachment types, with readings and anaphora
types derived; the syntactic derivation of *each*-movement itself is not represented.

## TODO

* §4.2 long-distance reciprocals and the Specified Subject Condition effects of §4.3.

/-! ### The compositional pieces (§2.2)

HLM's model is `⟨D, A, Π⟩`: a domain with mereological structure, atoms
`A`, and proper-part-of `Π`; `·Π` is the proper-*atomic*-part relation.
Pluralities are encoded here as `Finset A` (sums of atoms) with `·Π` as
membership, matching the `(R, X)` signature of
`Reciprocal`. -/

/-- (16): *other* as a 3-place relation — referent `z` is an atomic part
    of the range `y` distinct from the contrast `x`. In reciprocals both
    implicit arguments are supplied by the derived antecedent phrase:
    the contrast is bound by *each*, the range is coreferential with the
    antecedent. -/
def other (contrast : A) (range : Finset A) (z : A) : Prop :=
  z ∈ range ∧ z ≠ contrast

/-- (18): the reciprocator `[e other]` with universal force: `x` stands in `ζ` to every
    *other* atomic part of the range. The paper adopts universal force while considering
    groups of two, where universal and existential force coincide. -/
def reciprocator (range : Finset A) (ζ : A → A → Prop) (x : A) : Prop :=
  ∀ z, other x range z → ζ x z

/-- (19)/(28): the distributor — *each* or the covert `D` — universally
    quantifies over the atomic parts of its host NP. The world-free
    `Finset` form of `Plurality.distMaximal` (English floated *each*)
    and of `Algebra.D` (Link's D operator). -/
def distributor (np : Finset A) (φ : A → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ x ∈ np, φ x

/-- The LF of "np V each other" after *each*-movement (8)/(20):
    the distributor scopes over the reciprocated predicate, with the
    reciprocator's range and contrast both anaphoric to the derived
    antecedent. -/
def eachOtherLF (np : Finset A) (R : A → A → Prop) : Prop :=
  distributor np (reciprocator np R)

/-! ### The keystone (21) -/

/-- The compositional each∘other analysis derives Strong Reciprocity:
    HLM's truth conditions "coincide with those of the standard semantic
    analyses". Through the entailment lattice of
    `Reciprocal`, the weaker schemes follow
    (`strong_imp_weak`, …). -/
theorem eachOtherLF_iff_strongReciprocity (np : Finset A) (R : A → A → Prop) :
    eachOtherLF np R ↔ StrongReciprocity R np := by
  constructor
  · intro h x hx y hy hyx
    exact h x hx y ⟨hy, hyx⟩
  · intro h x hx z hz
    exact h x hx z hz.1 hz.2

/-- Distribution over a singleton yields a vacuously true reciprocal —
    no reciprocal content at all. HLM derive the plural-antecedent
    requirement (\**Mary saw each other*) more strongly: `·Π` is defined
    only on sum counterdomains, so distributors cannot apply to singular
    NPs; this vacuity is the semantic shadow of that definedness
    restriction. -/
theorem eachOtherLF_singleton (a : A) (R : A → A → Prop) :
    eachOtherLF {a} R := by
  intro x hx z hz
  obtain ⟨hz1, hz2⟩ := hz
  rw [Finset.mem_singleton] at hx hz1
  exact absurd (hz1.trans hx.symm) hz2

/-- (68) "They are taller than each other" is contradictory: the
    each∘other composition over an asymmetric relation fails on every
    genuine plurality. Under embedding, only broad scope of *each*
    rescues it ((69)/(70)); with an explicit matrix distributor,
    re-attachment would stack distributors ((71)/(72)), so only the
    contradictory narrow reading survives. -/
theorem eachOtherLF_asymmetric_contradictory
    {np : Finset A} {R : A → A → Prop}

    ¬ eachOtherLF np R := by
  intro h
  have hpos : 0 < np.card := by omega
  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := Finset.card_pos.mp hpos
  obtain ⟨y, hy, hyx⟩ := np.exists_mem_ne (by omega) x
  exact hasym x y (h x hx y ⟨hy, hyx⟩) (h y hy x ⟨hx, hyx.symm⟩)

/-! ### The grain problem (§3)

Plural NPs bear a *range* index and, optionally, a *distribution* index
((26)–(28)); in a reciprocal LF the reciprocator contributes a third
index. An embedded plural pronoun anaphoric to the antecedent therefore
has exactly four construals ((29)/(49)) — the theory is exactly as
fine-grained as the attested ambiguity of "John and Mary told each other
that they should leave". -/

/-! ### The scope puzzle (§4)

"John and Mary think they like each other" (64) has a narrow reading
(they think: we like each other) and a broad one (each thinks: I like
the other). HLM resolve it as the attachment site of *each* ((67)):
to the embedded pronoun (narrow) or to the matrix subject (broad). The
correlation with anaphora type is *derived*: distributors need
sum-denoting hosts and cannot iterate, and the trace of *each* must be
bound by the index its host acquires (Principle A). -/

  | embedded
  /-- `[[John and Mary]₁ each₂] think they₂ like [e₂ other]` — broad -/
  | matrix
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- Wellformedness of an attachment–construal pair, from two independent
    constraints: an *each* attached to the embedded pronoun needs a
    sum-denoting host that is not already distributed ((72): distributors
    do not iterate), and under matrix attachment the pronoun must carry
    the distribution index so that the trace of *each* is A-bound
    (Principle A, (74)). -/

    c.anaphoraType = .coreference := by
  cases c <;> simp_all [ScopeWellFormed, PronounConstrual.DenotesAtom,
    PronounConstrual.anaphoraType]

/-- Broad scope forces a bound-variable pronoun ((67b)): scope and
    anaphora type covary, the paper's answer to Williams's nonscope
    alternative (§4.1). -/
theorem broad_forces_bound_variable (c : PronounConstrual)
    (h : ScopeWellFormed .matrix c) :
    c.anaphoraType = .boundVariable := by

/-- Under embedded attachment exactly one construal survives: plain
    range coreference — (67a)'s indexing is forced. -/
