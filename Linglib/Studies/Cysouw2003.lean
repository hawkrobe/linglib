# Cysouw (2003): The paradigmatic structure of person marking

The paradigmatic structures of [cysouw-2003]. A person paradigm fills one slot with a closed set
of markers over eight referential categories, the three singular participants and the five
attested groups, and its structure is which categories share a morpheme: a setoid on
`Person.Category`, the syncretism of the paradigm's cell-to-form map. The book's kinds of
homophony, its types of the first person complex and its named structures are properties of that
setoid.

Two of the book's generalizations are implicational hierarchies, and each is a lower set of a
chain: horizontal homophony reaches the singular persons from the third upwards, and a paradigm
gives up its oppositions from the first person complex outwards. Every paradigm the book prints
is checked against its classification and against the hierarchies, with the exceptions the
book names.

## Main definitions

* `Cysouw2003.Clusivity`: the five common marking types of the first person complex, with their
  patterns `Clusivity.toPattern`, setoids on the four speaker-including cells.
* `Clusivity.Question`, `Pattern.profile`, `Pattern.RespectsHierarchy`: the four questions that
  tell the types apart, a pattern's positive answers, and the First Person Hierarchy.
* `Cysouw2003.Structure`: a paradigmatic structure, a setoid on `Person.Category`.

## Main results

* `Clusivity.rung_bijective`: the types are exactly the lower sets of the questions.
* `Clusivity.le_iff_profile_subset`: the hierarchy is the order of the profiles.

## Implementation notes

* The typology of the first person complex is finer than the WALS chapter on clusivity
  [cysouw-2013], which collapses minimal/augmented into inclusive/exclusive and whose "no 'we'"
  value is the absence of any first-person non-singular, not `noWe`.

* Cells the book draws as one block carry the same form string, so the syncretism of the
  forms is the book's block notation; fillers such as "(demonstratives)" are kept as printed.
* The named structures are kernels of the book's letter labellings, of which only the kernel
  matters.
* The book's Table 10.3 prints the descriptions of unified-we and only-inclusive swapped;
  Table 3.2 is followed.

## TODO

* Chapter 7's dual paradigms, the Dual Explicitness Hierarchy and the Dual Homophony
  Implication need cells for restricted groups.
* The zero implications of chapter 10 need zero marking read off the forms.
