# Collins 2005: a smuggling approach to the passive in English

The principles-and-parameters passive lets the suffix *-en* absorb accusative Case and the
external θ-role, so that the agent of *The book was written by John* is Merged nowhere near
where the agent of the active is Merged, against the uniformity of θ-assignment. Collins
returns to Syntactic Structures on this point: the external argument is Merged in Spec,vP in
the passive exactly as in the active, the participle head Part takes the VP and vP takes PartP,
and the verb precedes the external argument because PartP moves to the specifier of a VoiceP
headed by *by*, a head of uninterpretable features that takes a vP complement and checks the
Case that v checks in the active. That the movement is of the phrase and not of the verb's
head is shown by particles and stranded prepositions, which precede the external argument and
cannot follow it. The structure also orders the auxiliaries: *have* c-selects a participle,
Voice attracts one, and a participle must be licensed by exactly one of them, which admits
*has seen* and *was seen by* and excludes *has seen by* and *was seen*.

The movement is smuggling: the object inside PartP, which the external argument in Spec,vP
c-commands and so shields from Infl by Relativized Minimality, is carried past it, after which
the object is Infl's closest goal and raises to Spec,IP. Without the movement, or with head
movement of the verb alone, the object stays behind the external argument and the passive
cannot be derived; the derivation extracts the object from a moved constituent, and the paper
takes Freezing not to hold of PartP movement. A PP that follows the by-phrase has evacuated
PartP before the remnant fronted, so the external argument c-commands it, and a PP that precedes
the by-phrase has not, so it does not: negative polarity, *each* … *the other* and Principle C
line up with the position of the PP. A reflexive or a bound variable inside the fronted PartP
is bound only by reconstruction, which the paper takes to be marginal, and Principle B applies
as the external argument is Merged, so a coindexed pronoun inside PartP is out however PartP
later moves.

The passive is a `Derivation` on the syntactic-object carrier under each of the three analyses,
the surface strings are its externalizations, Relativized Minimality is the substrate's
closest-goal relation at the stage where Infl attracts, smuggling and remnant fronting are the
substrate's step predicates, and the paper's examples are the rows: `rm_converges` singles out
PartP movement, `licensing_rows` derives the c-command and binding judgments from surface and
derivational c-command, the binding judgments being the conditions of `Syntax/Binding` at the
levels the paper assigns them, of which the rows force Principle B's (`principleB_anyStage`),
`participle_rows` the auxiliary paradigm from the licensing principle, and `active_shares_vP`
is the θ-uniformity the analysis was built for.

## Implementation notes

* Part is `Cat.Asp`, silent, and the verb's raising to it (8) is not modelled: the participle
  is the verb's leaf. Voice is `by` with selection stack `[v]`, so a by-phrase over a DP is
  exocentric, the paper's (29). The evacuation host X of (58), AgrP or LkP for the paper, is a
  second `Cat.Asp` layer selecting PartP and the PP, so that v's selection is uniform; the
  object sits in Spec,VP rather than the paper's Spec,PartP. A PP enters as one leaf, and
  c-command of the leaf stands for c-command of the DP inside it.
* The rival analyses of (11) are the same derivation up to VoiceP: PartP movement raises the
  participle phrase, head movement re-Merges the verb's leaf at the root, standing in for the
  adjunction of (13), and the in-situ analysis raises nothing before the object moves.
  Convergence is whether the object is a closest D-goal for Infl at the stage where it raises;
  the Case side of the argument is prose.
* Principle A and bound-variable binding are evaluated at the surface, with reconstruction to
  any stage as the degraded option; Principle B at any stage, without the local-domain and
  Case-checked clauses of (83), which the monoclausal rows never exercise; Principle C at the
  surface, as §9 argues. The principles are the framework-neutral conditions of
  `Syntax/Binding` on the two positions, under one monoclausal configuration per level.

## TODO

* The double-object (53)–(54), the ECM and CP cases of (55), (57) and (81), the Principle C
  data (76)–(77), the freezing and reciprocal data of §10 ((88)–(93)), the quantifier-raising
  data of (94)–(98), and the Kiswahili and Japanese passives of §5 are not modelled.
* The Case checking by *by* and by the null Voice of short passives (§4, §6) is stated in
  prose; nothing here derives (47).
