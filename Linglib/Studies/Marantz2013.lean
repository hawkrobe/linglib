# Marantz (2013): Locality Domains for Contextual Allomorphy Across the Interfaces

This file formalizes the locality claim of [marantz-2013]: contextual allosemy, the choice
of a polysemous root's meaning in context, is bounded exactly as contextual allomorphy is,
by the spell-out domain of the first category head and by adjacency at the interface,
phonological for allomorphy and semantic for allosemy. Past tense conditions the root of
*taught* across a null v but not the root of *quantized* across *-ize*; a second category
head closes the domain, as *-er*, *-ness*, and the verb made from the noun *house* show;
*global* fixes the reading *globalize* cannot revert. The heads of the examples with their
nullness at each interface (`Head`, `Morpheme`, `cyclic`, `phonNull`, `semNull`) and the
words with the head whose conditioning is at issue (`Row`, `rows`) give the results: attested
conditioning is visible at its interface and blocked conditioning is not
(`allomorphy_rows`, `allosemy_rows`), idioms live below Voice in a domain that neither
contains nor is contained in the root's (`idiom_rows`, `domains_cross_cut`), and a head
that conditions the root is the first category head or noncyclic with only null heads below
it (`strong_prediction`).

## Implementation notes

The words are the rows of `Data/Examples/Marantz2013`, the examples of (1) to (3) and (5) to
(7) and Table 6.1 of the chapter; the locality predicates are those of
`Morphology/DistributedMorphology/Locality`.

/-! ### Predictions -/

/-- **Allomorphy** ((1)–(3), §6.2): the trigger conditions root allomorphy
iff it is local and every head between them is phonologically null. -/
theorem allomorphy_rows :
    ∀ r ∈ rows, ∀ c, r.allomorphy = some c →
      (r.spine.SeesRoot cyclic phonNull r.trigger ↔ c = .attested) := by
  decide

/-- **Allosemy** (§6.2–6.4): the trigger fixes a special root meaning iff it
is local and every head between them is semantically null — so an overt but
semantically null verbalizer lets a noncyclic participle or continuative reach
the root, and an overt adjectivizer blocks it. -/
theorem allosemy_rows :
    ∀ r ∈ rows, ∀ c, r.allosemy = some c →
      (r.spine.SeesRoot cyclic semNull r.trigger ↔ c = .attested) := by
  decide

/-- **Idiom** (§6.3): the idiomatic *nationalize* lies below any external
argument, though its v is not local to the root. -/
theorem idiom_rows :
    ∀ r ∈ rows, r.idiom = some .attested →
      r.spine.IdiomLocal agentive r.trigger ∧ ¬ r.spine.RootLocal cyclic r.trigger := by
  decide

/-- The two domains cross-cut: past tense is local to the root of *taught*
but above Voice, and the v of *nationalize* is below Voice but outside the
root's domain. -/
theorem domains_cross_cut :
    (∃ r ∈ rows, r.spine.RootLocal cyclic r.trigger ∧ ¬ r.spine.IdiomLocal agentive r.trigger) ∧
      ∃ r ∈ rows, r.spine.IdiomLocal agentive r.trigger ∧ ¬ r.spine.RootLocal cyclic r.trigger := by
  decide

/-- **The strong prediction** (§6.5): whatever conditions the root across an
intervening head sees only null heads below it, and if it is itself a
category head it is the first. -/
theorem strong_prediction {s : Spine Morpheme} {null : Morpheme → Prop} {i : Fin s.heads.length}
    (h : s.SeesRoot cyclic null i) :
    (∀ j < i, null s.heads[j]) ∧ (cyclic s.heads[i] → ∀ j < i, ¬ cyclic s.heads[j]) :=
  ⟨h.2, h.rootLocal.cyclic_first⟩
