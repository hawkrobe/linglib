# Agha and Jeretič (2026): Modal force and its realization across languages

This file formalizes the tests and typologies of [agha-jeretic-2026]'s survey of modal force.
Weak necessity is weaker than strong necessity: a strong necessity conjoined with the denial of
another over one domain is contradictory and the conjunction of two is trivial, while *should φ
but you don't have to* is consistent and *should φ, and in fact you must* is informative ((6),
(8), (11), (12)); the decided paradigm of [ferreira-2023] derives this from the force scale, and
the chapter's rows exhibit it across languages. Of the three analyses the chapter surveys,
domain restriction ([von-fintel-iatridou-2008]), comparison ([rubinstein-2014]) and plural
predication ([agha-jeretic-2022]), the first neg-raises only over a decided domain.
Polarity-sensitive variable-force modals are possibility modals whose necessity readings arise
from what they project ([deal-2011], [jeretic-2021b], [newkirk-2022a]): the projections of Nez
Perce *o'qa*, Siona *ba'iji*, Swedish *får* and Kinande *anga* license the readings of the
chapter's table in each environment, and exhaustifying a possibility modal over its subdomain
alternatives yields necessity ([bar-lev-fox-2020]). The scope of the necessity modals under
negation and the determiner–modal generalization for infinitival relatives
([hackl-nissenbaum-1999]) are stated over the rows.

## Main definitions

* `Projection`, `Available`: what a possibility modal projects, and the readings a projection
  licenses in an environment.

## Main results

* `contradiction_tests`, `triviality_tests`, `tests_predicted`, `crosslinguistic_tests`: (6),
  (8), (11) and (12) from the force scale, and the chapter's judgments row by row.
* `vfiWeak_negRaises_iff`: domain-restriction weak necessity neg-raises for every prejacent at
  once only in the one-world limit of its domain.
* `projection_matches_table`, `readings_licensed`: the four projections license exactly the
  readings of the chapter's table, and every reading of its examples.
* `exh_subdomain`: (50), exhaustification over the subdomain alternatives is necessity over
  the domain.
* `weak_never_narrow`, `must_narrow_iff_higher`, `haveTo_always_narrow`,
  `strong_determiner_should`: the scope and infinitival-relative generalizations over the rows.

## Implementation notes

* `Available` transcribes the chapter's reasoning about each cell of its table; only the
  exhaustification step is derived. *anga*'s `prunable` bit is idle, since its secondary
  ordering already yields weak necessity; why *anga* cannot prune *paswa* as *får* prunes
  *behöva* is the question the chapter leaves open.
* On *must* under higher negation the chapter and the rows of [rubinstein-2014] agree: both
  reject the reading with the negation inside the modal's scope.

## TODO

* The discourse-sensitive variable-force modals, the overt exhaustifiers, collapse variable
  force and the covert modals of the final section have no formal counterpart.

/-! ### Weak and strong necessity (§2.1) -/

/-- (6), (8): a strong necessity conjoined with the denial of a strong necessity over one domain
is contradictory; a weak necessity conjoined with it is consistent. -/

      Pattern.Consistent ⟨⟨.weakNecessity, false, false⟩, ⟨.necessity, true, false⟩⟩ := by
  decide

/-- (11), (12): a strong necessity after a strong necessity is trivial, after a weak necessity
informative. -/
theorem triviality_tests :
    Conjunct.Entails ⟨.necessity, false, false⟩ ⟨.necessity, false, false⟩ ∧
      ¬ Conjunct.Entails ⟨.weakNecessity, false, false⟩ ⟨.necessity, false, false⟩ := by

/-- The chapter's English tests: `□₁ φ ∧ ¬□₂ φ` is contradictory and `□₁ φ ∧ □₂ φ` trivial
exactly when the first force entails the second. -/
theorem tests_predicted :

/-- (15)–(17), (26), (28): across languages, a necessity modal survives the denial of strong
necessity exactly when its force is weak. -/

  decide

/-- Domain-restriction weak necessity neg-raises for every prejacent at once exactly when its
nested best-world domain has at most one world, the dichotomous limit [horn-2001] excludes from
neg-raising: a library observation, where the chapter's §2.5 only remarks that a
non-quantificational semantics may fare better on the neg-raising facts. -/

exhaustification of subdomain alternatives removes the possibility reading unless a scalemate
supplies it, and strengthens to strong or weak necessity according to the domain; under
clausemate negation there is no clause boundary for the exhaustifier, and the necessity reading
is no special case of possibility; in other downward-entailing contexts exhaustification is
optional. -/

/-! ### Exhaustification of subdomain alternatives (§3.2) -/

/-- (50): over a nonempty domain, exhaustifying the possibility modal, the disjunction of the
prejacent over the domain, against its subdomain alternatives yields necessity, the prejacent at
every world of the domain. Worlds are the states recording where the prejacent holds. -/

excludes the *could* reading, where a weak determiner allows both. -/
