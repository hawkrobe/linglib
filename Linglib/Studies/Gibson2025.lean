# Gibson (2025): Syntax: A Cognitive Approach

This file formalizes chapter 5 of [gibson-2025], where dependency length minimization is a
constraint on grammars: the head-direction generalization of [greenberg-1963] and [dryer-1992],
that a language's head-argument orders share one direction, follows because a disharmonic order
stretches the dependencies along a recursive spine. The measure is the total dependency length
of [futrell-mahowald-gibson-2015], illustrated on the book's (99a) (`totalLength_99a`), and a
head-final language reads the same structure in the mirrored order of its head-argument rules
with subjects kept before their verbs (`sov_harmonic`). The argument is worked through the
book's (122) and (123): every regime is one dependency structure read in a different order
(`Graph.linearize`), the harmonic orders are the shortest, and each mismatch of verb-complement
direction with the direction of infinitival, subordinator, adposition, or relative-clause
dependencies costs the lengths the book computes (`totalLength_122`, `totalLength_123`). The
mechanism is an arc to the far end of its own phrase (`Graph.ncard_dominated_le_dist`), which
is why the one-word dependents of Table 5.4 need not align (`single_word_free`).

## Implementation notes

Arcs follow the book's chapter 3: a subordinator or infinitival marker heads its clause, an
adposition its noun phrase, and a relative clause's verb the clause, with the nearest UD label
on each arc. The book's Tables 5.1 to 5.3, WALS cross-tabulations of verb-object order with
adposition, subordinator, and relative-clause order ([dryer-haspelmath-2013]), are prose here:
raw-count dominance over atlas rows is not a theorem of the theory. The full mirror of (123)
costs the same as the English order (`Graph.totalLength_mirror`); the book's head-final orders
cost more only because they keep subjects before their verbs.
