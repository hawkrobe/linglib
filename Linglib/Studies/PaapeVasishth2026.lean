# Paape and Vasishth (2026): Context Ameliorates but Does Not Eliminate Garden-Pathing

This file formalizes the multinomial processing tree of Paape and Vasishth. A trial follows a
route through a tree of Bernoulli decisions, and the route fixes the reading-time costs, whether
the reader regresses, and the acceptability judgment. The paper fits the tree to a replication
of Altmann, Garnham, and Dennis's study, which crosses referential context with complement- and
relative-clause disambiguation. Its case for the tree is that condition means cannot tell an
effect of context on attachment from an effect on reanalysis cost.

## Main definitions

* `ReferentialContext.Supports`: a context supports an analysis when its definite refers and,
  for a relative clause, the bare definite does not.
* `tree`: the tree of Fig. 1, as a measure on routes.
* `Costs.disambiguating`, `Costs.spillover`: the cost a route pays at each region.

## Main results

* `Condition.isMatch_iff`: the match coding of the design follows from `Supports`.
* `tree_real_gardenPathed`, `tree_real_regresses`, `tree_real_accepts`: the tree's marginals.
* `integral_disambiguating_tree`: the mean cost at the disambiguating region.
* `means_not_identifiable`: halving the garden-path probability and halving the covert
  reanalysis cost can leave every condition mean equal and the mixtures different.

## Implementation notes

Which cells match is derived from when each analysis's definite refers: with two women the bare
definite fails its uniqueness presupposition, as Altmann and Steedman argue. Costs are added
above non-decision time. The mixture's component distributions, the predictor structure across
conditions, and the baseline regression probability of the text are not modeled, and the
inattentive reader's bias is a free parameter rather than the estimate from Paape and
Vasishth's earlier model. The fitted estimates and the model comparisons are not formalized.
