# Dolatian (2020): Computational locality of cyclic phonology in Armenian

This file formalizes the analysis of destressed high vowel reduction in Chapters 1 and 2 of
[dolatian-2020] and its computational rendering in Chapter 6. Armenian stress falls on the
rightmost full vowel of a word, (1), and is reassigned as each suffix is added; a high vowel
that was stressed in the base and loses stress in the derivative, and only such a vowel,
reduces, deleting when the cluster it leaves is syllabifiable and otherwise becoming schwa,
(46). Reduction is cyclic without bound, (5) and (48): each morpheme may trigger a new round
of stress shift and reduction. It is stratal, after [kiparsky-1982]: in Western Armenian the
derivational suffixes that build morphological stems trigger the stem-level cophonology of
stress shift with reduction, while the inflectional suffixes that build morphological words
trigger the word-level cophonology of stress shift alone, (7) to (9). And it is prosodic: in
Eastern Armenian vowel-initial inflection reduces as well, (10) and (65), because onset
maximization resyllabifies the stem-final consonant and misaligns the Prosodic Stem of
[downing-1999] that the morphological stem maps to; the misaligned stem expands over the
suffix and triggers a cophonology of its own, which reduces high vowels in Eastern but not in
Western Armenian and reduces the diphthong *uj* in neither, (76) and (78). The plural
allomorphy of (66), *-er* after monosyllables and *-ner* after polysyllables, thereby decides
whether a plural reduces its base. Reduction itself is a quantifier-free logical transduction
in the sense of [chandlee-2014], §6.6.1: given the destressing diacritic, deletion and schwa
are read off two segments on either side of the target.

## Implementation notes

Segments are kept at the granularity the analysis reads: consonant, high vowel, other full
vowel, the diphthong *uj*, and schwa, so that *u* and *i* are one symbol and the segmental
detail of [vaux-1998] is not represented. Stress is computed as the position of the rightmost
full vowel rather than as the logical transduction of Chapter 5, and destressing compares that
position across a cycle; the reduction step is the transduction `dhr`, run on the string with
the destressed vowel marked, so a cycle composes a stress function with a quantifier-free map,
and the domain label that the dissertation's SETTINGS constant supplies to the reduction
formulas is the cophonology argument of `reduce`. Syllabifiability, (46), is the condition
that the destressed vowel be flanked by single consonants that themselves neighbour nuclei.
Prosodic Stem misalignment is read off the stem-final consonant and the suffix-initial vowel,
without a syllabification. The foot and recursive prosodic word alternatives of §2.5.3, the
lexical exceptions of (72) and the variation of §2.7.3, and the compound bracketing paradox of
Chapter 3 are not formalized.

## TODO

The complex-coda clause of (46), a second consonant before the target licensed when the two
form a falling-sonority coda, needs a sonority scale over consonants; with one consonant
symbol, `dhr` gives schwa where the dissertation deletes, as in *jergír* ~ *jergr-a-kúnt*, (17).
