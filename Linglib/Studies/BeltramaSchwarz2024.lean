# Beltrama and Schwarz (2024): Social Stereotypes Affect Imprecision Resolution across Different Tasks

Beltrama and Schwarz describe the speaker of a round numeral as Nerdy, as Chill, or not at all,
and show a phone screen whose number matches the numeral, diverges from it slightly
(Imprecise) or largely. In a Covered Screen task, comprehenders reject the Imprecise screen
more often for Nerdy speakers and less often for Chill ones than at baseline: a persona that
embodies precise speech narrows the numeral's extension (Hypothesis 1). In a Truth Value
Judgment task the Chill effect recurs but Nerdy speakers are rejected as often as the baseline,
which fits neither of the paper's hypotheses for that task. The paper suggests that rejection
is prejudicial there, blaming the speaker, though it then expects every condition to be judged
more charitably, which it does not find.

## Main statements

* `ground_profile_subset_iff`: the traits each persona is introduced with index poles of
  exactly the precision variant it embodies, in the field [beltrama-solt-burnett-2023] measured.
* `Hypothesis1.rejects`, `rejects_imprecise_iff`: Hypothesis 1 as monotonicity of rejection in
  strictness; the Imprecise screen is rejected at the paper's narrow range and accepted at its
  wide one.
* `observed_coveredScreen`, `not_hypothesis2A`, `not_hypothesis2B`: the Covered Screen results
  bear out Hypothesis 1, and the Truth Value Judgment results fit neither Hypothesis 2A nor 2B.
* `PrejudicialAccount.not_agrees`: no table of rejection rates that agrees with the printed
  results satisfies the account of §7.

## Implementation notes

* The precision field is the opposition reading of [beltrama-solt-burnett-2023], precise and
  imprecise speakers occupying opposite quadrants (§2, note 2).
* A persona's profile is read off its traits that are scales of [beltrama-solt-burnett-2023]
  (*articulate*, *uptight*, *laid-back*); the other five traits were not measured there.
* A precision level is a grain width (`Degree.grain`); the ranges of p. 5 are the cells of
  *$200* of widths ten and twenty.
* Rejection rates are only plotted (Figures 3, 6, 8); the results are the paper's verdicts, and
  the account is tested on every table of rates agreeing with them.

vanishes. -/
