# Solt (2018): Multidimensionality, subjectivity and scales

This file formalizes [solt-2018a]'s account of ordering subjectivity, the faultless disagreement
some gradable adjectives allow about their comparatives: which of two dishes is tastier, but not
which of two people is taller. A gradable adjective lexicalizes a family of measure functions
indexed by contexts (35). Its comparative is subjective for a pair when two contexts order the
pair oppositely (`OrderingSubjective`), which is incomparability with the contexts read as
dimensions (`orderingSubjective_iff_incompRel`), and settled when every context orders it alike
(`Settled`). Objectivity is a single measure that every context agrees with (`Externalizable`).
Additive measures that never reverse a pair differ only in unit (`eq_smul_of_forall_lt_imp_le`,
the uniqueness half of Hölder's theorem), so an additive family (36) is externalizable exactly
when it has no ordering subjectivity (`externalizable_iff_forall_not_orderingSubjective`), and so
is a homogeneous function of such measures (38) (`externalizable_derived`), such as fullness (39)
(`fullness_eq`).

For a multidimensional adjective such as *dirty* (41) the context weights the kinds of dirt, and
the verdict that all weightings share is the Pareto rule (`forall_dirty_le_iff`). A pair is
settled when one object carries at least as much of every kind of dirt per unit of size and more
of some (`settled_dirty_iff`), and subjective when neither dominates the other
(`orderingSubjective_dirty_iff`), so the class is mixed. A judge-dependent adjective (42) has
unconstrained measures, so every pair of distinct individuals is subjective
(`orderingSubjective_of_surjective`) and none is settled (`not_settled_of_surjective`). These are
the three classes of Table 1, matching the experiment of section 2: speakers judged disagreements
about the comparatives of measurable adjectives factual, those about evaluative adjectives
matters of opinion, and the rest mixed.

## Implementation notes

* `OrderingSubjective` asks for a strict reversal, the disagreement of the dialogues (2) and
  (5)–(7); section 5.3's "difference in the relative ordering" is broader, but the two coincide
  on the families formalized.
* Concatenation (36) is the addition of an `AddCommMonoid`. Additivity alone does not exclude
  ordering subjectivity, since a positive weighting of additive measures is additive; that the
  measures of height differ only in unit is what section 5.1 suggests ("this might be the only
  sort of variation that is possible"). Likewise (38) needs `f` homogeneous.
* In (41) a context is a weighting positive on every kind of dirt, the kinds and amounts being
  fixed; the units of amount and size only rescale the score. With unbounded weights a pair is
  settled exactly when it is Pareto-ordered, where "contexts can only vary so much" (section 5.4)
  suggests bounded ones.
* "Not constrained in any formal way" (section 5.4) is `Function.Surjective`, a strong
  idealization.

## TODO

* The five stimulus categories of section 2.2, their rates of 'fact' judgments in Figure 1 (98,
  94, 67, 55 and 4 %) and the appendix dialogues are not encoded as example rows; the rates of
  single adjectives are drawn only in a bar chart.
* The rows of Table 1 for ambiguous adjectives (*bumpy*, *salty*) are not formalized. Read as one
  family over both readings' contexts, such an adjective would settle no pair.
* Section 5.5's *intelligent*, multidimensional yet purely subjective, and the externally
  anchored measures of time and temperature are not formalized.
