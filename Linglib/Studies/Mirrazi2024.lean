# Mirrazi (2024): Indefinites in Negated Intensional Contexts

*Rodica does not think that Carl read some of the books* has, in Farsi, a reading on which the
indefinite scopes above the negation but below *think*: Rodica believes that there are books Carl
did not read, without believing of any particular book that he did not read it. No syntactic
position is at once above the negation and below the attitude, so Mirrazi derives the reading
from a choice function closed above the negation whose world argument the attitude binds,
(44), and likewise for a modal, (48). An intensional choice function, applied to the intension
of its restrictor but not skolemized to a world, gives only the de re reading when the
restrictor is the same set in every belief world, (41)–(42): the fixed-set problem.

## Main results

* `skolemized_iff`: closing a world-skolemized function above the negation, with its world
  argument bound by the operator, gives the reading on which the indefinite scopes below the
  operator and above the negation.
* `intensional_iff_of_fixed`: an intensional choice function on a restrictor that is one fixed
  set across the accessible worlds gives the de re reading.
* `Scenario40.skolemized`, `Scenario40.not_intensional`, `Scenario40.not_narrow`: in the context
  of (40) the skolemized function makes the sentence true, no intensional function does, and the
  narrow reading is false.

## Implementation notes

* Negation is below the attitude, as the paper's excluded-middle presupposition yields; the
  attitude and the modal are a box over an accessibility relation.
* The noun's world argument is bound together with the determiner's, as the paper assumes.
* The paper fixes only the books the function picks in three belief worlds, (45); the scenario
  makes those books the unread ones, one per world.
