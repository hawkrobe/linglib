# Muñoz Pérez (2026): Stylistic Applicatives

This file formalizes the analysis of the stylistic applicative of Chilean Spanish in
[munoz-perez-2026]. A marked anticausative with an affected dative surfaces in General Spanish
with the cluster *se me*. Chilean Spanish also has *me le* and *se me le*, with an invariable
*le* that refers to nothing, and the three are synonymous. The alternation is confined to first
and second person singular datives and to predicates that take the anticausative marker.

The paper takes the dative clitic to realize an applicative head and *se* to be an expletive in
the specifier of a Voice head that introduces no argument and has no meaning. A fission rule
splits an applicative head that is [+PART, +SING] into two exponents when the predicate is
inchoative: a clitic with the person and number of the head, and the inflectionless dative *le*.
At PF the Voice projection must be overtly marked by a reflexive clitic, and every head must be
pronounced. The first exponent of a fissioned head is syncretic with a reflexive, so it can mark
Voice while *le* pronounces the applicative head. This is why *se* is optional exactly where
fission applies, and since the three clusters spell out one clause under a meaningless Voice
head, they do not differ in meaning.

## Main declarations

* `Clause`, `Clause.site`, `marked`, `unmarked`: a clause by its Voice head, its verbal heads
  and the bundle of its applicative head, with the site of that head; the clauses of marked and
  unmarked anticausatives.
* `IsFissionApplicable`, `applExponents`: the fission rule and the exponents it gives the
  applicative head.
* `Converges`: the two PF conditions on the clitics of a clause.
* `clusters`: the clitic clusters a clause surfaces with.

## Main results

* `isFissionApplicable_iff`: fission applies to the speaker and the addressee alone.
* `clusters_marked`, `clusters_unmarked`: the typology of realizations. A marked anticausative
  has the marker with a plain dative and, where fission applies, the fissioned dative with and
  without the marker; an unmarked one has the plain dative alone.
* `marker_optional_iff`: the marker can be absent exactly where fission applies.
* `converges_of_fission`, `not_converges_singleton`: fission rescues a clause without the marker
  because the dative is syncretic with the reflexive outside the third person, and an unfissioned
  dative cannot, since it would leave the applicative head unpronounced.
* `anticausative_rows`, `other_rows`: the judgments on the paper's clitic clusters.
* `causer_reading_rows`: the unintentional causer reading arises only from the marked clause.
* `isLicit_me_iff_nos`: no person case constraint separates *me le* from *nos le*.

## Implementation notes

The verbal heads of a marked anticausative are a change and a result state and those of an
unmarked one a change alone, after the structures the paper adopts from [cuervo-2003]; the
applicative head merges as low as the structure allows, taking the result state as its complement
where there is one, [cuervo-2003]'s affected applicative, and the theme otherwise (`Clause.site`);
the context of the fission rule, the change head over the applicative over the state head, is
that the site is affected. The paper leaves the structure of unmarked anticausatives open; all
that matters here is that they lack the result state and a Voice head that asks for a marker.
The optionality of the marker in the syntax, which the paper derives from a principle that lets
an unchecked feature fail, is built into `markers`.
The clauses given to *quejarse* and to impersonal *dar* say only that they are not inchoative.

## TODO

The paper's comparison with the two-flavour Voice of [martin-schaefer-kastner-2025] is not
formalized.
