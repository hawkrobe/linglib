# Rett (2026): Semantic ambivalence and expletive negation

This file formalizes the paper's account of low expletive negation, negation that targets
truth-conditional content without changing it. A scalar construction licenses it when it is
fixed-point ambidirectional: the construction relates the informative bound of its argument,
and an interval and its complement share that bound. The degrees an individual reaches and
the degrees it does not both have the individual's height as their bound, `sharesBounds_Iic`,
so a comparative with a negated standard is the comparative, `tallerNeg_iff_taller`, whereas
a scale with a top gives the complement a second bound and blocks the pattern. The runtime of
a negated event is the interval before it, `preEvent`, whose end *before*, *until* and *since*
read as the event's start, `before_preEvent_completive_iff`; *after* gains nothing from it and
*while* is not ambidirectional. The negated standard stays downward entailing, so negative
polarity items survive. The paper's examples are rows, and `en_rows` records which
constructions attest expletive negation.

## Implementation notes

Degrees are a linear order and a degree relative denotes the ray of degrees an individual
reaches; maximality relativized to a scale is the least upper bound on the positive scale and
the greatest lower bound on the negative one, which is what a negated degree relative
carries. Times carry a bottom, the paper's minus infinity, so that the pre-event interval is a
closed interval of the substrate. The survey counts of Jin and Koenig, the high expletive
negation of exclamations, the manner implicature effects and the negative verbs are discussed
in the paper without a proposal formalized here.
