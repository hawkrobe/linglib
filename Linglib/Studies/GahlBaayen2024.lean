# Gahl and Baayen (2024): Time and Thyme Again

Gahl had found that the more frequent of two homophones, such as *time* against *thyme*, tends to
be shorter in speech. Gahl and Baayen recast this with a discriminative lexicon, linear maps
between semantic vectors and triphone vectors with no stored words, so frequency cannot be a
property of a word. It splits instead into practice, frequency-informed learning of the
production map, and contextual independence, the share of a word's predictability in an
utterance that it owes to itself. The duration models are not formalized; the paper's two worked
examples are.

## Main statements

* `semanticSupportForForm_endstate_time_lt_thyme`, `semanticSupportForFormFIL_thyme_lt_time`:
  practice reverses which homophone's form its meaning supports more.
* `time_sub_thyme_notMem_ker`: the homophones *time* and *thyme* get distinct predicted forms.
* `not_existsUnique_isELTrained`: regression does not determine the word-to-word map.
* `diag_W_mem_Icc`: the self-prediction shares of the toy words lie in `[0, 1]`.

## Implementation notes

* The paper fits only production, so both toy lexicons have the zero comprehension map.
* The paper estimates the corpus-scale word-to-word map with the Rescorla–Wagner rule, which is
  not formalized; `W` is the pseudoinverse solution it uses for the toy corpus.
