# Partee & Borschev 2003: Genitives, relational nouns, and argument-modifier ambiguity

Paper-anchored consumer of the relational/possessive substrate for
[partee-borschev-2003]. P&B defend a **split** analysis of the genitive against
the **uniform "argument-only"** analysis of [vikner-jensen-2002] (J&V): some
genitives are *arguments* of a relational noun, others are *modifiers* carrying
a free contextual relation. The two construction types map exactly onto the
substrate:

* **argument genitive** (relational head noun supplies R): `of John's = λR[R(John)]`,
  `teacher of John's = λx[teacher(John)(x)]` — this is `possessiveRelational`.
* **modifier genitive** (sortal head noun + free relation `Rᵢ`):
  `of John's = λPλx[P(x) ∧ Rᵢ(John)(x)]`, `team of John's = λx[team(x) ∧ Rᵢ(John)(x)]`
  — this is `possessiveSortal` (Barker's `π`).

## Main statements

* `vj_coerce_eq_pb_modifier` — **convergence** (P&B §4.3): for a pragmatically
  coerced sortal noun, J&V's "coerce to a relation, then take as argument" and
  P&B's modifier genitive yield the *same* predicate. The accounts differ only
  in *where* the free relation enters, not in truth conditions — `rfl`.
* `FormerMansion.readingA_ne_readingB` — **divergence** (P&B §4.3, *Mary's former
  mansion*): under the modifier *former*, putting the free relation inside vs.
  outside its scope gives different predicates. J&V's coercion derives both;
  P&B's split derives only the R-outside reading — J&V's empirical advantage.
* `predicateGenitive_eq` — P&B §5.1: the predicate genitive *John's* (*that team
  is John's*) is a bare ⟨e,t⟩ predicate `λx[Rᵢ(John)(x)]` = `possessiveRelational`,
  which the uniform argument-only approach cannot produce standalone.

/-! ### The two approaches converge on coerced sortals (P&B §4.3)

For *team of Mary's* both accounts derive `λx[team(x) ∧ Rᵢ(Mary)(x)]`. J&V coerce
*team* to the relation `π team Rᵢ` and apply the argument genitive; P&B apply the
modifier genitive directly. The free relation enters inside the coerced noun for
J&V, with the construction for P&B — but the result is identical. -/

/-- **Convergence** (P&B §4.3): J&V's coerce-then-argument equals P&B's modifier
genitive. The "two theories of genitives" are, on the coerced-sortal case, a
single denotation reached two ways. -/
theorem vj_coerce_eq_pb_modifier (possessor : E) (P : Pred1 E S) (R : Pred2 E S) :
    possessiveRelational possessor (π P R) = possessiveSortal possessor P R :=
  rfl

/-! ### The predicate genitive (P&B §5.1)

*That team is John's*: the genitive surfaces as a bare one-place predicate with a
free relation, `λx[Rᵢ(John)(x)]`. P&B argue this is not always reducible to an
elliptical argument NP, so English needs the modifier genitive — a problem for
the uniform argument-only approach. -/

/-- The predicate genitive *John's* is the possessee predicate `λx[R possessor x]`
= `possessiveRelational possessor R`, a genuine ⟨e,t⟩ predicate (here `Pred1`). -/
theorem predicateGenitive_eq (possessor : E) (R : Pred2 E S) :
    (fun x s => R possessor x s) = possessiveRelational possessor R :=
  rfl

/-! ### The readings of *Mary's former mansion* (P&B §4.3)

`former` (CN/CN) modifies the noun predicate; `formerRel` (TCN/TCN) modifies a
relation. With the free relation `R` *outside* `former` (Reading A) vs. *inside*
`formerRel`'s scope (Reading B), the genitive denotes differently. P&B's split
introduces `R` only with the construction, after `former`, deriving Reading A
alone; J&V's coercion can introduce `R` at the noun-shift, deriving both. -/

/-- Reading A: the free relation is outside `former`'s scope — *a former mansion
that is now Mary's*. The only reading P&B's split derives. -/
def readingA (former : Pred1 E S → Pred1 E S) (possessor : E)
    (noun : Pred1 E S) (R : Pred2 E S) : Pred1 E S :=
  possessiveSortal possessor (former noun) R

/-- Reading B: the free relation is inside `formerRel`'s scope — *something that
was formerly Mary's mansion*. Available on J&V's coercion. -/
def readingB (formerRel : Pred2 E S → Pred2 E S) (possessor : E)
    (noun : Pred1 E S) (R : Pred2 E S) : Pred1 E S :=

both — J&V's empirical advantage (P&B §4.3). -/
