# Bach, Brown & Marslen-Wilson (1986): crossed vs nested dependencies

Dutch verb clusters cross their NP–verb dependencies (NP₁ NP₂ NP₃ V₁ V₂ V₃),
German nests them (NP₁ NP₂ NP₃ V₃ V₂ V₁). Matched Dutch and German sentences are
rated equally comprehensible at one level of embedding; from two levels on Dutch
is easier on both ratings and probe accuracy (Tables 1, 3) — yet only the nested
pattern is parsable by a push-down store, so parsing difficulty does not track
stack-parsability ([evers-1975], [bresnan-etal-1982]).

An NP–verb binding is a permutation `σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`: crossed is
`Equiv.refl`, nested is `Fin.revPerm`. `totalIntegrationCost` formalizes the paper's informal
argument that crossed orders integrate each NP into the matrix structure as its
verb arrives while nested orders hold every NP until the cluster ends.

## Main statements

* `totalIntegrationCost_refl`, `totalIntegrationCost_revPerm`: closed forms
  `n(n−1)/2` (crossed) and `n(n−1)` (nested).
* `cost_gap`: the gap equals the whole crossed cost — 1 at two verbs, where the
  experiment finds no difference, 3 and 6 at Levels 3–4, where it does.
* `nonprojective_is_cheaper`: the antitone (stack-parsable) binding is the
  expensive one.
