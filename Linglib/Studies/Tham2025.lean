# Tham (2025): Multidimensionality and the Scalar Components of Physical Disturbance Predicates

This file formalizes [tham-2025]'s account of physical disturbance predicates, change-of-state
verbs such as *crack*, *dent* and *scratch* and their deverbal adjectives, whose root has a
count noun form naming an irregularity in an affected host ([karmo-1977]). The paper argues
that the predicates are associated with a gradable scale closed at both ends, against the
two-point scale of [rappaport-hovav-2014] and the partial, upper-open scale of
[rotstein-winter-2004]: the verb has durative uses and the adjective comparative ones,
(10)–(11), both take *completely* and *partially*, (15), (20)–(21), and both telic and atelic
uses of the verb entail the adjectival state, (14), (17). The adjective is multidimensional in
the sense of [sassoon-2013] and [solt-2018a]: *badly* evokes the quantity, quality or
positioning of the disturbances, (22)–(25), and respect phrases individuate the dimensions,
(28). The three scalar components have three sources (section 3.4): the lower bound is the
existence of a disturbance, so unmodified predication is objective, (26); the gradable interval
comes from the dimensions, so degree-modified predication admits faultless disagreement, (27);
and the upper bound is the spatial extent of the host, (33).

The adjective's measure function (47b) is the weighted extent of the disturbances relative to
the host's spatial extent, `degree`, with the weights the context's dimensions; the positive
form (46) compares it with a degree, `Pos`. A weighting positive on every dimension makes the
degree positive exactly when some disturbance has positive extent, `degree_pos_iff`, so
whether the host is cracked does not depend on the weighting, `degree_pos_iff_degree_pos`,
while the weightings that select single dimensions, the respect phrases `respect`, can rank two
hosts oppositely, `more_respect_and_more_respect`. A disturbance within the host's extent has a
degree at most one, `degree_le_one`, and the same disturbance on a smaller host has a higher
degree, `degree_lt_degree_of_lt`. The verb (48) describes an event whose final degree meets the
root's standard and exceeds the initial degree by a difference degree, `Event`, `Verb`: every
use of the verb entails the adjective at the standard, `Verb.pos_final`, and the verb modified
by a high difference degree entails the adjective modified by the same degree, `Verb.pos`, but
not conversely, since a pre-existing crack that grows a little leaves the windshield badly
cracked without its having cracked badly, `Event.pos_not_verb`.

## Implementation notes

The measure sums over an index type of dimensions, each with a nonnegative extent measure on
hosts, in the profile vocabulary of `Semantics.Degree.Aggregation`; the paper's comparative at a
weighting is the utilitarian rule on the extent profile when the hosts have the same spatial
extent, `more_iff_utilitarian`. A respect phrase is the weighting `Pi.single i 1`, so respect
phrases and quantification over respects are the paper's grammatical access to dimensions for
the adjective; the paper's claim that the verb allows only conceptual access, and its speculation
that the difference degree is the reason, are not formalized. The examples are the rows of
`Data.Examples.Tham2025`; the consultant counts of section 4.2 and the online survey of section
3.2.2 are recorded in their comments.
