# Cohen (1999): Think Generic!

Cohen's inductivist semantics makes a generic sentence a probability judgment: gen(ψ, φ) is
true iff the conditional probability of the scope, given the restrictor and the disjunction
of a set of alternatives to the scope, exceeds one half (definition 1, p. 37). "Mammals
bear live young" is evaluated over the mammals that procreate in some way, so no majority
among all mammals is required, and Thomason's "People have a hard time finding CMU" is
evaluated over the people who sought it. Generics are further ambiguous between this
absolute reading and a relative one whose threshold is the average probability of the scope
over the alternatives; the relative reading verifies "Bulgarians are good weightlifters"
and, since its threshold depends on individuals outside the restrictor, it is not
conservative (definition 3, pp. 55–56). The probability is a relative frequency in the
limit, which imposes two constraints. The reference class may not be explicitly bounded
(§4.4.2), and it must be homogeneous: unrestricted homogeneity is degenerate, since
partitioning by the scope itself separates any mixed reference class (definition 4 and
Salmon's argument, pp. 81–82), so the final truth conditions demand the majority within
every inhabited cell of every salient partition of the restrictor (definition 5, p. 83).
"Mammals are female" then fails under the sex partition however many mammals are female
(§4.4.6). Frequency adverbs apply other thresholds to the same conditional probability —
always 1, never 0, sometimes non-zero, usually the same one half as gen — and respect only
the temporal partition, which is why "Primary school teachers are usually female" is true
while the bare generic is not (definition 10, p. 128; §6.2.3).

We state the three definitions over finite models, derive the degeneracy of unrestricted
homogeneity, the conservativity of the absolute reading and a non-conservativity witness
for the relative one, the recovery of the relativized classical quantifiers at the
frequency-adverb thresholds, and the paper's key examples.

## Implementation notes

Page and definition numbers follow the CSLI edition, a light revision of the 1996
dissertation that renames its independent and dependent readings absolute and relative.
The alternative set enters the truth conditions only through its extensional disjunction
and the relative threshold, so it is carried as a single predicate. A conditional
probability is the uniform measure on the reference class at the scope; with an empty reference
class it is undefined in the paper (p. 37, §5.6) and `0` here, so gen is false there and
decidable through its count form, and a salient cell with an empty reference class imposes no
condition.

## TODO

* The unboundedness constraint (§4.4.2) and lawlikeness (§4.4.3) restrict which sentences
  express generics at all — a matter of reference classes conceivable as unlimited, with no
  content over a fixed finite model — and are not stated.
* Chapter 5's calculus of alternatives (absolute determinables, focus, the connectives) and
  chapter 7's default reasoning are not formalized; the alternative set is taken as given,
  as in §3.2.

Twenty mammals, eight of which procreate: six bear live young, two lay eggs. Eleven are
female, among them every procreator. Relativized to the forms of procreation, the first
generic is true though bearers are a minority of all mammals, and the male cell of the sex
partition is empty of procreators, so definition 5 agrees. The second clears definition 1
on the female majority alone but fails definition 5, since the male cell is inhabited and
contains no female — the paper's resolution of the contrast with different alternatives and
the sex partition. By definition 10 the same threshold read as the adverb usually ignores
the non-temporal partition (§6.2.3), so "usually female" stays true. -/

arbitrary one to be good, though no majority of Bulgarian lifters is. In the soccer
