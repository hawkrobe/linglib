# The nouns that say -ni

Telugu nouns show two stem alternations. The strong one (*il-lu* ~ *in-ṭi* 'house') is
contextual allomorphy of the nominalizer n conditioned by [ACC], the feature every
nonnominative case contains under [caha-2009]'s containment ([mcfadden-2018]). The weak
one (*samudr-am* ~ *samudr-āni* 'ocean') only looks like case allomorphy: it violates *ABA,
is triggered by agreement suffixes in nominative contexts, and reads the weight of the next
syllable inside the prosodic word. It is the phonology of one underlying *-am-ni*, derived in
Stratal OT ([kiparsky-2000]) from prespecified stress on the singular suffix *-ni*.

This file defines the Vocabulary Items of the strong alternation, the weak generalization, the
singular suffix, and the Stem, Word, and Phrase tableaux with the marks of the paper's (49),
(59), (62), (63), (66), and (67) under the rankings of (64) and (68).

## Main definitions

* `strongItems`, `strongN`: the Vocabulary Items of (4) and the n exponent they insert.
* `weakN`: the weak alternation by the syllable that follows n.
* `numItems`, `numSg`: the singular suffix *-ni* of (40).
* `wordOrder`, `phraseOrder`: the rankings of (64) and (68).

## Main results

* `strong_rows`, `weak_rows`: both alternations against every paradigm cell of the pool.
* `weak_not_case_function`, `weak_violates_aba`: the arguments against case conditioning.
* `oblique_across_quantifier`: the locality contrast of (33)–(36).
* `wordDat_optimal`, `wordNom_optimal`: both surface forms from one underlying *-am-ni*.
* `distZero_alignR_max_reranked` and its siblings: the Word-to-Phrase rerankings of (68).

## Implementation notes

The cases of the paradigms are those of `Telugu.Case`, the paper's P cell being the locative
postposition *-lō*, and the containment order on them is the scoped Caha order on `Case`.
