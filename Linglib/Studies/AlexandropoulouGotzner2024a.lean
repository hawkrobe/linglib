# Alexandropoulou and Gotzner (2024a): relative and absolute adjectives under negation

Two rating experiments set Horn's face-based account of negative strengthening
against Krifka's complexity-based one on three kinds of negated antonym pairs:
weak relative (*not large* vs *not small*), weak absolute (*not clean* vs *not
dirty*) and strong (*not gigantic* vs *not tiny*, *not pristine* vs *not
filthy*). The accounts' applicability conditions differ — Horn needs a semantic
extension gap, Krifka's M-principle needs semantically equivalent competitors —
so the three cases pull them apart (the paper's Table 1).

The predictions are computed from the mechanisms over the four surface forms:
Horn's R-strengthening of the face-threatening negated positive and Q/R
middling of the double negative (`hornRanges`), Krifka's BiOT quadruplet from
`Krifka2007b` (`krifkaRanges`), and its NACH extension as a comparison of
complexity deviations (`deviation`). The design's factors and the gap condition
are read off the Fragment: strength from the extreme standards of *gigantic* and
*pristine*, adjective type from the scale, and the gap from the standards. The
reported findings — an asymmetry for
weak relatives only — confirm Horn on the weak cases, refute both Krifka
variants, and leave Horn's strong-adjective prediction unsupported.

/-- A design cell pairs an adjective type with an informational strength; Table 1 pools the two
strong cells. -/
inductive Cell
  | weakRelative
  | weakAbsolute
  | strongRelative
  | strongAbsolute
  deriving DecidableEq, Fintype

/-- `c.pair` is the cell's antonym pair, whose positive pole is the evaluatively positive
member. -/
def Cell.pair : Cell → AntonymPair
  | .weakRelative   => size
  | .weakAbsolute   => cleanliness
  | .strongRelative => extremeSize
  | .strongAbsolute => pristineness

/-- A cell is strong when its adjectives are extreme, with standards beyond the weak pair's. -/

/-! ### Communicated ranges -/

/-- A `Ranges` assigns each surface form the scale regions it may communicate. -/
abbrev Ranges := AntonymForm → Finset Region

/-- A negated antonym pair is interpreted asymmetrically when the negated positive and the negated
negative forms diverge, and symmetrically when they behave in parallel. -/
inductive Asymmetry where
  | asymmetric
  | symmetric
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq, Fintype

/-- Positive and negative forms communicate mirror-image ranges. -/

/-- Horn's ranges assume a semantic gap. The negated positive is R-strengthened to the
    face-threatening antonym it conceals, while the prolix double negative is Q/R-restricted to the
    gap the simpler positive could not describe. -/
def hornRanges : Ranges
  | .positive    => {.positive}
  | .negative    => {.negative}

/-! ### The Negative Adjectives Complexity Hypothesis -/

/-- `complexity nach f` is the complexity of the form `f` with (`true`) or without (`false`)
    NACH. Under NACH the negative
    adjective carries a covert negative morpheme, so *small* counts like *unhappy*;
    without it the simple antonyms are equally simple and their negations equally
    complex. -/
def complexity : Bool → AntonymForm → ℕ
  | true, f => f.complexity
  | false, .positive | false, .negative => 0
  | false, .notPositive | false, .notNegative => 3

/-- `simpleOf f` is the simple form co-extensive with `f` under bivalent semantics. -/
def simpleOf : AntonymForm → AntonymForm
  | .notPositive => .negative
  | .notNegative => .positive
  | f => f

/-- `deviation nach f` is the excess complexity of `f` over its co-extensive simple form, the
    stereotype deviation the M-principle assigns it. -/
def deviation (nach : Bool) (f : AntonymForm) : ℕ :=
  complexity nach f - complexity nach (simpleOf f)

/-- Without NACH both negated forms deviate equally from their antonyms; with it
    *not small* deviates more from *large* than *not large* does from *small*. -/
theorem deviation_nach :
    deviation false .notPositive = deviation false .notNegative ∧
    deviation true .notPositive < deviation true .notNegative := by
  decide

/-! ### Table 1 -/

/-- `horn c` is Horn's prediction for a cell, made where a semantic gap makes the account
applicable. -/
def horn (c : Cell) : Option Asymmetry :=
  if c.HasGap then some hornRanges.asymmetry else none

/-- Krifka's account, with or without NACH, makes a prediction only for weak pairs, since the
    M-principle needs semantically equivalent competitors, which only weak pairs provide (by
    bivalence for relatives, by entailment for absolutes). -/

/-! ### Findings -/

/-- `finding c` is the reported interpretation pattern of a cell. Experiment 1 found a Negation
    effect for weak relatives (β = 0.64, p < .01) and none with strong as the reference level
    (p = 0.86); Experiment 2 found none for weak absolutes (p = 0.17) and only a marginal one for
    strong absolutes (p = 0.07). -/

conditions. -/

  | some "negative", some "nonNegated" => some .negative
  | some "negative", some "negated" => some .notNegative
  | _, _ => none

/-- Each row's design factors are its adjective's in the Fragment, which is strong exactly when
its standard is extreme and relative exactly when its scale is. -/
theorem row_factors :
