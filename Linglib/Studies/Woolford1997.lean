# Woolford (1997): Four-Way Case Systems: Ergative, Nominative, Objective and Accusative

This file formalizes [woolford-1997]'s account of the Nez Perce case system, in which a
transitive clause is nominative–accusative or ergative–objective and a ditransitive adds a
second object case. The core inventory has three structural cases, nominative and objective
checked in the specifiers of Agr-S and Agr-O and accusative assigned by the verb inside VP, and
the lexical cases ergative and dative, assigned with a θ-role (`WCase`). Agreement is checked
in the specifier of an Agr head, so nominative and ergative subjects both trigger subject
agreement while only objective objects trigger object agreement (`WCase.position`). A verb
assigns at most as many accusatives as it has arguments minus its lexical cases minus one, the
Max. Acc. formula (`Frame.maxAcc`), which subsumes Burzio's generalization and the
generalization that a lexically cased subject denies accusative to its highest object. An
object denied accusative moves to Spec Agr-O for objective case; there is one such position,
and economy sends the thematically highest caseless object there (`Frame.pattern`). The four
attested ditransitive patterns and the eight prohibited ones follow (`patterns_22A`,
`patterns_22B`); the strong reading of the generalization, on which a lexical subject denies
accusative to every object, leaves the ergative double-object clause underivable
(`strong_underivable`); and the differences between Nez Perce, Thangu and Kalkatungu reduce to
whether ergative and dative are assigned optionally or obligatorily (`Params.patterns`).

## Implementation notes

Accusative assignment is obligatory in Nez Perce, so a nominative subject never co-occurs
with an objective object; the paper attributes nominative–objective patterns elsewhere to
languages whose verbs assign accusative optionally or not at all, a parameter not modelled
here. Dative is placed on goals only, as in the paper's ditransitive frames.
