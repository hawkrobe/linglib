# Stump (2016): Inflectional Paradigms

This file formalizes two of the deviations from the canonical content-to-form isomorphism
argued for in [stump-2016], on the paradigm-linkage model of the substrate's
`Morphology.Linkage`. Latin deponent verbs inflect by means of the morphology that
ordinarily expresses a verb's passive forms: the deponent *cōnārī* realizes its active
content cells with the passive personal endings a regular verb like *parāre* uses only for
its passive, and lacks passive-meaning forms. This is a property mapping that crosses the
voice axis: the regular verb's linkage preserves the content cell's property set and is
canonical (`parareLinkage_isCanonical`), while the deponent's replaces active with passive
on every active cell (`conari_deviates_on_every_active_cell`,
`conari_active_realized_by_passive_form`), so that the same active content cell has an
active form correspondent for the one verb and a passive one for the other
(`depon_vs_regular`).

The Kashmiri recent, indefinite and remote preterites of the intransitive conjugations II
and III are realized through four morphomic properties, the past morphomes a to d, by
property mappings that differ by one morphome (`pmII`, `pmIII`): the indefinite past of
WUP and the recent past of WUPH share the past b form correspondent and inflect alike
(`kashmiri_inflect_alike`), as do the remote past of WUP and the indefinite past of WUPH
(`kashmiri_inflect_alike_pastC`). Content cells carry the tenses and form cells the morphomes,
and within one conjugation the preterites keep distinct form correspondents
(`linkII_not_syncretic`). The form cells are realized by the PFM block cascade of
`Morphology.Paradigm.Function`.

## Implementation notes

The Latin cells are abstracted to voice and agreement, with the inflection-class index and
tense, aspect and mood held constant, and no realizations are attached to the Latin
linkages. The Kashmiri forms and their stem-plus-suffix segmentation are the book's
display of Grierson's paradigms, with the first person singular masculine exponents only. The
Kashmiri property mappings act property by property, which agrees with the book's mappings on
every property set with a single tense.
