# Rooth (1992): A theory of focus interpretation

Rooth unifies the effects of intonational focus. Alternative semantics gives a phrase a focus
semantic value beside its ordinary one, the set of substitution instances at the focused position,
computed here by mapping a predicate over an F-marked constituent whose alternatives are the whole
domain (`WithAlternatives.focused`). Association with *only*, contrasting phrases, scalar
implicature and question-answer congruence each require some object to be a subset or an element
of a focus semantic value, and the focus interpretation principle keeps only that requirement: the
operator ~ presupposes `Focus.SquiggleSet` or `Focus.SquiggleInd` of a free variable whose
antecedent is a `Focus.Antecedent`.

## Main results

* `three_a`, `three_b`, `only_rows`: *only* over a domain constrained by focus gives (3a) and (3b)
  their truth values.
* `recognitions_fixed`, `recognitions_constrained`: the domain is constrained rather than fixed,
  since the full focus semantic value of a focused verb contains the trivial relation.
* `verbFocus_scale`, `ace_notMem_subjectFocus`, `roommate_implicature`: focus on the verb licenses
  the acing scale that focus on the subject does not, and the group scale yields the roommate
  implicature.
* `question_resolves_subjectFocus`, `question_rejects_objectFocus`, `qa_rows`: a question
  admits the answer whose focus semantic value contains it.
* `ellipsis_filter`: in bare remnant ellipsis focus filters a compositional ambiguity, each
  correlate finding an antecedent for ~ under exactly one focus placement.

## Implementation notes

* Worlds of the relational models are sets of atomic facts, so that distinct facts denote
  distinct propositions; the quiz model assigns each person a grade, acing entailing passing,
  with groups as finite sets of people.
* The rows carry the paper's examples with the truth values of the introduction scenario and
  the question-answer judgments, which the theorems derive.
* *Only* is the substrate's exclusive assertion on the identity scale,
  `Focus.Particles.atMost (· = ·)`, which is (4b) with the equation reversed. Footnote 2 leaves
  open whether the prejacent belongs in the presupposition or the assertion, and suggests that
  the property may only need to be the strongest in the domain, the entailment scale.

/-! ### Focusing adverbs (§2.1)

*Only* quantifies over a domain `C` of properties: if Mary has a property in `C`, it is the one
the VP expresses ((4b), (30b)). Focus constrains `C` to lie inside the focus semantic value of
the VP ((9c)). At the propositional level the assertion is the exclusive's assertion on the
identity scale, `Focus.Particles.atMost (· = ·)`, which is the entailment-scale exclusion where
the prejacent entails no other member of the domain
(`Focus.Particles.atMost_eq_eq_atMost_subset`). -/

(14): construe `α` as contrasting with `β` if the ordinary value of `β` is a member of the focus
semantic value of `α`; the paper derives it from the individual case of the focus

/-! ### Scalar implicature (§2.3)

Asserting a member of a scale implicates the negation of the members that entail it. The
constraint on scales (22) requires the underlying set to lie inside the focus semantic value of
the assertion, so the two placements of focus in (16) and (17) license different scales. -/

/-! ### Questions and answers (§2.4)

/-! ### Bare remnant ellipsis (§7–§8)

*She beats [me]F more often than Sue* has two logical forms, with the object or the subject as
the correlate of the remnant; focus does not enter the grammar of ellipsis but filters the two,
since the ~ operator at the main clause needs the *than*-clause as an antecedent of the right
form (64)–(66). -/
