# Lu, Pan and Degen (2025): Evidence for a Discourse Account of Manner-of-Speaking Islands

This file formalizes the backgroundedness account of manner-of-speaking islands that
[lu-pan-degen-2025] support in five acceptability experiments. A constituent is foregrounded
when its alternatives are among the answers to the question under discussion, (3), with
alternative sets and answers after [roberts-1996] and [roberts-2012], and backgrounded otherwise
(`Foregrounded`), which is the question deciding each of the constituent's alternatives
(`Setoid.le_ker_iff_forall_decides`). A communication event has a manner and a content,
and the manner question backgrounds the content (`mannerQUD`, `contentQUD`,
`not_foregrounded_content_mannerQUD`). Movement foregrounds the moved element, so moving it out of
a backgrounded complement is the information-structural clash of [erteschik-shir-1973]: the
embedded object is an island exactly when the complement is backgrounded under the question under
discussion (`Island`).

Prosodic focus sets that question, focus on the matrix predicate raising the manner question and
focus on the embedded object the content question. Without focus the predicate sets it: a
manner-of-speaking verb carries a manner component, *whisper* being *say* in a whispering manner,
which makes the manner question the default, while the light *say* leaves the content question
(`activeQUD`, `island_iff`). The experiments' findings follow for each predicate: embedded focus
removes the island of a manner-of-speaking verb, Experiment 1 (`island_whisper_iff`); focus on
*say* creates one, Experiment 2a (`island_say_iff`); and a manner adverb makes *say* behave as a
manner-of-speaking verb, by default in Experiment 3a and under focus in 3b
(`island_sayAdverb_iff_island_whisper`). The manner component is read from the verb's Levin class in
`Fragments/English` (`MatrixPredicate.hasManner_of_mannerOfSpeaking`,
`MatrixPredicate.hasManner_say_iff`), and the stimulus rows
of `Data/Examples/LuPanDegen2025` are classified by the same rule (`rows_classified`).

## Implementation notes

(3) asks the alternatives relative to a constituent to be among the complete answers to the
question. Over partition questions, whose cells are the complete answers, this is rendered as
the question settling the constituent: two events in one cell agree on it, so the question
decides each of its alternatives. The paper takes one question to be under discussion at a time,
which is why focus overrides the predicate's default.

The negation test (7) of earlier work is not formalized: the paper counts it a test of
projection, correlated with backgroundedness but distinct from it, and probes the embedded
object's backgroundedness with a comprehension task instead. The subjacency and
verb-frame-frequency accounts the paper argues against are described in prose: prosodic focus
changes neither structure nor frequency, and the *say* plus adverb contrast holds the verb
constant. The residual difference between manner-of-speaking verbs and *say* under one prosody
in Experiment 2a, the default backgroundedness contrast of Experiment 2b, and the rating means
are not represented; the paper notes that the account makes no prediction about the obligatory
overt complementizer of manner-of-speaking complements (22).
