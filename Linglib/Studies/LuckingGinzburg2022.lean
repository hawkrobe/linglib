# Lücking and Ginzburg (2022): Referential Transparency as the Proper Treatment for Quantification

This file formalizes the denotations of quantified noun phrases in the referential
transparency theory of [lucking-ginzburg-2022]. In place of the sets of sets of generalized
quantifier theory ([barwise-cooper-1981]), a quantified noun phrase denotes a set of ordered
bipartitions of the head noun's extension into a reference set and its complement set, the
quantifier word acting as a sieve on them through a descriptive condition on the two
cardinalities (`sieve`). Such a condition is a quantifier on [van-benthem-1984]'s tree of numbers
(`Quantifier.NumberTree`), and the sieve reads only the row of the tree at the size of the noun
(`sieve_eq_iff`), which yields the paper's count of `2 ^ (k + 1) - 1` denotations over a noun
with `k` instances (`card_powerset_antidiagonal_erase`). A verb phrase predicates on the
reference set and anti-predicates on the complement set (`AntiPredication`), so the sentence is
true exactly when the condition holds of the sizes of `N \ VP` and `N ∩ VP`
(`exists_antiPredication_iff`). So referential transparency has the truth conditions of the tree
quantifier of its condition (`exists_antiPredication_iff_toGQ`), which recovers the paper's claim
that the set-up entails the conservativity universal (`livesOn_toGQ`), and the surviving reference
sets are exactly the witness sets of [barwise-cooper-1981] (`mem_sieve_iff_witness`). The
quantifier perspective, whether the bipartition with an empty reference set survives the sieve,
gates anaphora to the complement set (the paper's (47), `CompsetAccessible`,
`compsetAccessible_sieve`). The paper's minimal pair (43a) ~ (44): *few* and *a few* share their
condition, but *a few* carries a reference individual, so its denotation lacks the
empty-reference bipartition and the complement set is inaccessible whatever the condition
(`compsetAccessible_few`, `not_compsetAccessible_refind`).

## Implementation notes

An ordered bipartition of `S` (the paper's (15)) is determined by its reference set `R ⊆ S`, the
complement set being `S \ R`, so a denotation is a `Finset (Finset α)` of reference sets and the
bipartitions of `S` are its powerset. A condition on the cardinalities of the complement and
reference sets is a `NumberTree`, whose coordinates are `|A \ B|` and `|A ∩ B|`, in the order
of the paper's (18), so the paper's *every*, *no* and *some* are the tree's `all`, `no` and
`some`. *Few* takes the proportional sense of (38a), its *much smaller* weakened to a strict
comparison; the cardinal sense of (38b), *few* against a contextual standard, is not represented.
The contextual standard of *many* is a parameter. Anti-predication, the negation of a plural type
on the complement set, is read distributively as the paper's gloss of (55b) does. The quantifier
perspective is derived from the denotation as the proposition that the empty reference set is in
it, where the paper carries it as a lexical feature; its third value for degenerate denotations
collapses into inaccessibility, which gates anaphora identically. The count of §4.8 is read off
the paper's enumeration for two individuals, the non-empty selections of cardinality types; the
paper's own gloss of the subtraction speaks of the empty set. Negation of a noun phrase, which
the paper's (49) shows to flip accessibility, the dialogue and gesture data, the
clarification-request diagnostics, and the type-theoretic encoding are not represented.

## TODO

The derived perspective makes the complement set accessible after any cardinal quantifier whose
set contains zero (`compsetAccessible_cardinal`), including *fewer than 100* in the paper's (43d),
which the paper marks as blocking the anaphora; the lexical feature of the paper can stipulate
its way past the case, the derivation cannot.

The paper's count of 63 quantifiers on a two-element domain (§4.8) multiplies the per-noun count
over the subsets of the domain rather than over their sizes, so it distinguishes the two
singletons, against its own closing remark that a quantifier word applies one condition to the
extensions of every noun. The permutation-invariant selections number `∏ (2 ^ (k + 1) - 1)` over
the sizes `k ≤ n`, 21 for two individuals, and from three individuals on the paper's product
exceeds the `2 ^ ((n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2)` tree quantifiers of [van-benthem-1984].
