# Schlenker (2004a): Context of Thought and Context of Utterance

This file formalizes the two-context logic of [schlenker-2004a]. A sentence is evaluated
against a Context of Utterance, the point at which a thought is expressed, and a Context of
Thought, the point at which it originates. Tenses and pronouns are sorted variables: the
assignment gives their value, and the Context of Utterance fixes the domain that value must lie
in, on pain of referential failure (`Term.sorted`, `Term.Defined`). Every other indexical is a
function of the Context of Thought (`Term.indexical`, `Term.value`). The Context of Utterance
therefore enters the definedness conditions and never the truth conditions, which is the
paper's Elimination of the Context of Utterance: `Formula.Realize` takes the Context of Thought
alone, and replacing the sorted variables by simple ones (`Formula.strip`) preserves truth
(`realize_strip`) and removes every source of failure (`defined_strip`).

Free Indirect Discourse and the Historical Present are the two ways in which exactly one of the
two contexts coincides with the actual context (`Mode.of`). In *Tomorrow was Monday* (1), a
past tense under a Context-of-Thought adverbial is defined only when the thought precedes the
utterance (`defined_lamPast_iff`), so against a single context the sentence is contradictory
(`not_defined_lamPast_self`), and Free Indirect Discourse places the character's thought in the
narrator's past (`freeIndirect_time_lt`). In *Fifty eight years ago ... the Germans attack
Vercors* (2), a present tense under the adverbial is defined only when the Context of Utterance
lies fifty-eight years before the Context of Thought (`defined_lamPres_iff`), so the Historical
Present sets the utterance in the past (`historicalPresent_time_eq`), and a first person pronoun
in the same passage makes that past context improper (`not_properContext_of_defined`).

## Implementation notes

* The appendix's sole world term `actually`, the world of the Context of Thought, is built into
  the atomic clauses; the paper's two predicate arities are `Formula.atom₀` and
  `Formula.atom₁`, with the predicates given as Lean propositions.
* Truth is the paper's pair of predicates: `Formula.Defined` is the negation of *weird* and
  `Formula.Realize` is *true*, read with the junk-value convention where the paper leaves truth
  undefined. A λ-abstraction whose argument fails is weird, which the appendix leaves implicit.
* The rows of `Data/Examples/Schlenker2004a.json` are the paper's (1) and (2); the schemas
  `lamPast` and `lamPres` are their logical forms with the predicate left open. Banfield's
  Priority of SPEAKER and the interpretation of gender features are discussed in the paper
  without a formal proposal and are not formalized.

/-- A term of the two-context logic over contexts `C`, valued in `α`. A simple variable and a
multiply sorted variable both take their value from the assignment; the sorted variable is in
addition restricted to a domain fixed by the Context of Utterance, outside which it fails to
refer. An indexical is a function of the Context of Thought. -/
