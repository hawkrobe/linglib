# Grove (2022): Presupposition Projection as a Scope Phenomenon

This file formalizes the scope theory of presupposition projection of [grove-2022],
"Presupposition projection as a scope phenomenon", on which a presupposition trigger denotes a
value of a maybe type, undefined on presupposition failure, and its presupposition projects to
the constituent over which it takes scope. The maybe types are `Option`, whose unit and bind
are the type shifts of (15); the intensional monad of section 4.1 is the reader transformer
over it, as the paper's footnote says (`Iₚ`); the connective of (16) is the middle Kleene
material conditional (`materialCond`); the presuppositional universal of (27) is undefined
wherever its scope is; and *believe* is the Hintikka quantifier (28) over them. The proviso
problem of section 2.1 then dissolves into a scope ambiguity. For *If Theo has a brother,
he'll bring his wetsuit*, the trigger in situ yields the conditional presupposition of the
satisfaction theory (`localReading_isSome_iff`), the consequent pied-piped over the conditional
yields the unconditional one (`globalReading_isSome_iff`), and the two readings agree wherever
the global one is defined. For *Theo believes he lost his wetsuit*, section 4.2, the clause in
situ presupposes a wetsuit at every doxastic alternative and the clause scoped above the verb a
wetsuit at the evaluation index, with the at-issue content reconstructing by Left Identity
(`believeGlobal_eq_some_true_iff`).

## Implementation notes

The truth-value type is `Bool`, so the possibly undefined truth values are `Option Bool`, the
library's `Trivalent` in monadic form, and the predicates of the models are decidable
propositions turned into truth values by `decide`. The universal of (27) quantifies over a whole
type and is defined classically. The readings are stated for arbitrary index and entity types,
the trigger *his wetsuit* being an `Iₚ I E` value, so the presupposition theorems are general
rather than checked on a finite model. The monad laws of Figure 7 are Lean's lawful-monad
instance for the reader transformer. The paper's judged sentences are rows of
`Data.Examples.Grove2022`.

## TODO

The syntax of roll-up pied-piping in Figures 2 and 6 and the sketched *also* of (29) are not
represented; the readings are the meanings the derivations deliver.
