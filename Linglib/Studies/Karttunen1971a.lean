# Karttunen (1971)

Karttunen identifies the implicative verbs, *manage*, *remember*, *bother*, *dare*, *happen* and
the others listed in (2), whose assertion commits the speaker to the complement and whose
negation commits the speaker to its negation. He analyzes such a sentence as a
presupposition–proposition pair: the proposition `v(S)` is what is asserted, negated or
questioned, and the presupposition says what condition `v(S)` is for the complement. Schema (37)
makes `v(S)` necessary and sufficient for `S` (*manage*), (41) necessary and sufficient for `¬S`
(*fail*, *forget*), (54) necessary only (*be able*, *be possible*), and (59) sufficient only
(the positive verbs of (56), *cause*, *make*, *have* and *force*); the non-implicatives *hope*,
*want* and *try* carry no such presupposition.

Each schema fixes an implication signature: (37) is `+/−`, (41) `−/+`, (54) `◦/−` and (59) `+/◦`,
and the negative verbs of (56), *prevent* and *dissuade*, are `−/◦`. The analysis is
`Implicative.sentence` under the material reading of the conditions
(`Implicative.Reading.material`), which gives the paper's entailment facts: double negation cancels
as in (13) (`manage_neg_neg_holds_imp`), and the one-way schemas and the non-implicatives leave the
other direction open (`force_neg_not_entails`, `beAble_not_entails`, `ofProp_not_entails`). The
English fragment's entries for the verbs of (2), (38), (44) and (56) carry the signatures of their
schemas (`implicative_eq`) and so are presupposition triggers (`isTrigger_of_mem_english`), while
its entries for the non-implicatives of (2) carry `◦/◦` (`implicative_eq_bot`).

## Implementation notes

Karttunen states (59) for the positive verbs of (56) only. The negative ones are read with the
matching presupposition, `v(S)` sufficient for `¬S`.
