# [fox-2018]: Partition by Exhaustification: Comments on Dayal 1996
[dayal-1996] [heim-1994] [groenendijk-stokhof-1984] [spector-2008]

Single-paper formalisation of [fox-2018], "Partition by
Exhaustification: Comments on Dayal 1996" (ZAS Papers in Linguistics
60 / Sinn und Bedeutung 22). Fox derives Dayal's maximality
presupposition from the demand that question denotations *partition*
the Stalnakerian context-set via point-wise exhaustification of the
question's Hamblin members.

## Substrate identifications

Fox's central operator is the `Exh`-derived **cell identifier**: the
set of worlds where a given proposition `p` is the maximally
informative true Hamblin alternative.

| `Max_inf(Q,w)` (eq 9b)                 | the unique `p` with `IsStrongestTrueAnswer Q w p` (when EP holds) |
| `Partition_L(Q)` (eq 3)                | logical partition by `strongAnswer`-equivalence |
| `Partition_C(Q,A)` (eq 10)             | contextual partition (A-restricted) |
| Dayal's `Ans_D` presupposition         | `IsExhaustivelyResolvable` (Exhaustivity.lean) |
| **Cell Identification (CI)** (eq 19)   | `CellIdentification` defined here |
| **Non-Vacuity (NV)** (eq 20b)          | `NonVacuity` defined here         |
| **Question Partition Matching (QPM)** (eq 20) | `QPM = CI ∧ NV`              |

## Section coverage

* **§1.1** Question duality (partition vs Hamblin set) — captured by
  the substrate's `Question W = LowerSet (Set W)` (Hamblin shape) and
  `strongAnswer Q w` (the partition view as equivalence classes).
* **§1.2** Dayal's solution — `IsExhaustivelyResolvable` is already
  the substrate's predicate; `Exh` here connects it to Fox's
  partition-by-exhaustification view.
* **§1.3** Empirical evidence (singular *wh* inferences, negative
  islands) — paper-anchored prose; substrate captures the
  uniqueness/existence inferences via `IsStrongestTrueAnswer`.
* **§1.4** Interim summary — defines `CI` and `QPM`; both are formalised
  here.
* **§2.1** Mention-some challenge — `Ans_D` over-restricts;
  `IsExhaustivelyResolvable` fails for MS questions (`where can I
  get gas in Cambridge`).
* **§2.2** Higher-order quantification (Spector 2008) — requires
  generalised-quantifier *wh*-restrictors over UE quantifiers;
  deferred to a future Spector 2008 study file.
* **§3** Over-generation + QPM — formalised here.
* **§4** Alternative `Exh` definition (Bar-Lev & Fox 2017 free-choice
  conjunctive `Exh`) — requires free-choice machinery; deferred.

## What this file does NOT cover

* The Free-Choice / scalar-implicature interpretation of `Exh` (Krifka
  1995 / Bar-Lev & Fox 2017): the substrate's `Exh` here is the
  *strongest-true-answer* set, not the formula-level FC operator.
* Negative islands as Maximality Failure (Fox & Hackl 2006; Abrusán
  2007/2014): require degree-question / dense-domain machinery.
* The §6 type-shift and §7 MS-distribution predictions: paper-internal
  empirical claims about distribution of higher-order interpretations.

Fox's `Exh(Q,p)` and `Partition_L(Q)` are substrate primitives now —
see `Semantics/Questions/Exhaustivity.lean::exhCell` and
`exhaustifiedPartition`. We re-export them here under Fox's names for
paper-faithfulness, and define the paper-specific contextual variant
locally. -/

/-- [fox-2018] (19): **Cell Identification (CI)** — every cell

    intersected with `A`. -/

/-! ### §1.2 Dayal's EP ↔ CI (the central bridge)

Fox's central claim (eq 11–12): when Dayal's maximality presupposition
is met (i.e., every world in `A` has a maximally informative true
answer), the contextual partition is exactly the image of `Exh`.
The substrate-level form of this connection: `IsExhaustivelyResolvable
Q w` for every `w ∈ A` implies `CellIdentification Q A`. -/

/-- [fox-2018] eq (11)→(12): if every world in the context-set
    has a maximally informative true answer, every cell of the
    contextual partition is `Exh`-identifiable. The substrate
    counterpart of the Dayal-EP-implies-CI direction. -/

/-! ### §2.1 Mention-some challenge

[fox-2018] §2.1 (21): "Mary knows where we can get gas in
Cambridge" has an MS reading not derivable from `Ans_D` (which
demands the maximally informative answer). The substrate mirror:
some questions have `¬ IsExhaustivelyResolvable Q w` at the
evaluation world even though they are perfectly answerable in the MS
sense (`Resolves σ Q` succeeds for some non-maximal `p`). -/

/-- A question can fail Dayal's EP at world `w` while still being
    `Resolves`-supported there. The substrate-level distinction
    underlying Fox §2.1's MS challenge. The hypothesis `hp₁p₂ : ¬ p₁ ⊆
    p₂` together with maximality of both alts witnesses the
    incomparability that defeats EP. -/
