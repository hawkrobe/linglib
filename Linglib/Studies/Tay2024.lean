# Tay (2024): Resultative Expressions in Mandarin Chinese

This file formalizes Tay's account of why Mandarin V-V resultatives realize their arguments
more freely than V-*de* resultatives and English resultatives. A V-V resultative is a
synthetic compound built in morphology, V1-∅-V2, so its components are inaccessible to
syntactic operations, chapter 2: a locative can modify V1 of a V-*de* resultative but not of
the compound, (45)–(46), and *repeatedly* has only the whole-event reading on the compound,
(41)–(44). The null affix ∅ introduces a macroevent containing a causing event described by V1
and a caused event described by V2, inherits every argument of V2, and existentially closes
every argument of V1 (110), `nullAffix`; the variant ∅+C also names the crucial contributory
factor of the macroevent (111), `nullAffixC`. The factor is a function of the macroevent, so a
change has one, `ccf_unique`, and V1's arguments are closed, so nothing relates the arguments
of the compound to those of V1, `nullAffix_of`: the external argument can be V1's agent
(131)–(132) or its theme (133)–(134), the internal argument need not be V1's agent
(202)–(206), and the sole argument of an unaccusative compound can be V1's agent (219),
which is why Mandarin has subject-oriented resultatives without a reflexive.

What does constrain the external argument is the Onset Condition of [kim-2024], (141): an event
integrated into the macroevent of a simplex causative is the initial event of its causal chain,
`Model.Onset`. The factor is a participant in that initial event, `Model.CcfInitial`, and
V1's event is integrated, so the factor is a participant in V1's event,
`participant_of_nullAffixC`: no pure causers (146)–(149), while subject matters are
participants (150)–(151). The rows carry the paper's reading of the external argument, and a
transitive compound is ungrammatical exactly where that reading is a pure causer,
`ungrammatical_iff_pureCauser`. The macroevent must contain the two subevents rather than
identify or nest them: in *shè-sǐ* 'shoot dead' (107) the shooting and the dying overlap at the
moment of contact only, so their traces are neither equal nor nested, `shooting_trieventive`.
Chapter 8's typology varies whether the null head merges in morphology, whether the result X
can be a verb, and whether a transitive resultative takes an intransitive X; the third follows
from whether the language's change-of-state verbs alternate, since an intransitive one that
does not carries no factor and the null head supplies it, `ResultativeType.intransitiveX`,
with Mandarin's *pò* (684)–(686) the witness, `po_not_alternating`.

## Implementation notes

Predicates take their arguments as tuples `Fin n → D`, so a family of null affixes indexed by
the arities of V1 and V2 is one definition. The causal relation, the factor, the participant
relation and the causal chain of each macroevent, (136), are the primitives of a `Model`; the
thesis takes the causal relation to be Lewis's counterfactual causation and leaves its
characterization open. Events are partially ordered by causal precedence, the initial event of
a chain is its least event, and the Onset Condition is [kim-2024]'s, `Kim2024.OnsetCondition`.
Temporal traces are rational intervals. The compounds are entries of
`Fragments/Mandarin/Resultatives.lean`, which record no orientation: the apparent
subject-oriented transitives *chī-bǎo* (3) and *qí-lèi* (330) are the hybrid resultatives of
chapter 4, whose postverbal phrase is an argument of V2, and that chapter, the V-*de*
construction's syntax (chapter 6), the case against the No Argument Theory (chapter 5) and the
null head ∅+C+B for adjectival X (693) are not formalized.

the causing event `e₁` and the caused event `e₂`; `ccf e` is the crucial contributory factor
of `e`, the essential factor in bringing about its result, if `e` is a change with one,
`CCF(e) = c` in (111); `participant e x` says `x` is a participant in `e`; and `chain e` is the
causal chain of events that the macroevent `e` comprises (136). -/

/-! ### Trieventive structure (chapter 2, section 3.3) -/

section Traces

variable {E : Type*} (trace : E → Set ℚ)

/-- The temporal signature of the monoeventive analysis (104): V1 and V2 describe one event, so
one trace. -/
def Monoeventive (e₁ e₂ : E) : Prop := trace e₁ = trace e₂

/-- The temporal signature of the bieventive analyses (105)–(106): one event is a part of the
other, so one trace contains the other. -/
def Bieventive (e₁ e₂ : E) : Prop := trace e₂ ⊆ trace e₁ ∨ trace e₁ ⊆ trace e₂

/-- The events of *shè-sǐ* 'shoot dead' (107). -/

def shooting : Ev → Set ℚ
  | .shoot => Set.Icc 0 1

nested, so only the trieventive macroevent accounts for (107). -/

/-! ### Typology (chapter 8) -/

/-- The parameters of the typology: whether the null head merges in morphology and whether the
result X can be a verb (section 2), and whether the language's deadjectival change-of-state
verbs have transitive counterparts (section 3.1), in which case its intransitive
change-of-state verbs are reflexivizations carrying their own crucial contributory factor
(692), and otherwise denote a becoming with none (686). -/
structure ResultativeType where
  compound : Bool
  verbalX : Bool
  alternating : Bool

namespace ResultativeType

/-- A transitive resultative takes an intransitive X iff X can be a verb that carries no
factor, so that the null head ∅+C supplies one (694), (697); an X carrying its own leaves none
for the head to introduce, since a change has one (section 3.3). -/

theorem verbalX_of_intransitiveX {t : ResultativeType} (h : t.intransitiveX) : t.verbalX :=

end ResultativeType

/-- Mandarin V-V resultatives are compounds with a verbal X, and its deadjectival
change-of-state verbs lack transitive counterparts (681)–(683), so a transitive resultative
takes an intransitive X, *dǎ-pò* (673). -/
def mandarin : ResultativeType := ⟨true, true, false⟩

/-- English resultatives are not compounds, X is never a verb (669), and *break* alternates
(676)–(677). -/
def english : ResultativeType := ⟨false, false, true⟩

/-- Japanese V-V resultatives are compounds with a verbal X, and its change-of-state verbs come
in transitive and unaccusative pairs (687)–(690), so a transitive resultative takes no
intransitive X (674)–(675). -/
def japanese : ResultativeType := ⟨true, true, true⟩

example : mandarin.intransitiveX = true := rfl

example : japanese.intransitiveX = false := rfl
