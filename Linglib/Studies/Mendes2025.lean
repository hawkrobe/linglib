# Mendes (2025): Indefiniteness in future reference

Mendes analyses the Subordinate Future, a subjunctive combined with a forward-shifting temporal
morpheme, in Muskens's compositional discourse representation theory over situations. The
subjunctive is an indefinite that introduces a situation among the historical alternatives of
its anchor, and the indicative is the definite that retrieves it. A main clause is therefore
evaluated in the future situation its subordinate clause introduced (modal donkey anaphora), and
a strong quantifier whose restrictor carries the form has its existence presupposition satisfied
in a historical alternative rather than at the anchor (modal displacement).

## Main results

* `sfForm_true_at`: the truth conditions of the paper's conditional and relative-clause
  derivations.
* `temporal_shift`, `modal_donkey_anaphora`: the orderings of the paper's table of main-clause
  tenses, and the retrieval of the introduced situation.
* `subj_fut_true_at`, `ind_fut_true_at`: a restrictor in the Subordinate Future is true in some
  later historical alternative of the anchor, one in the indicative only in the anchor's world.

## Implementation notes

* States assign situations to registers only: individual drefs are saturated in the radicals
  (*Ivan leaves the room* is a situation predicate), so the quantifying-in of the relative clause
  reduces to the implication of its restrictor and nuclear scope.
* A situation is a world–time `Index`, and *s₂ is part of the world of s₁* is world identity.

The forms `SF(A); tense(C)` of the paper's table of main-clause tenses: a conditional
antecedent or a relative clause carrying the Subordinate Future, `subj^{s₁}_{s₀}(fut(A))`, and
a main clause `ind^{s₂,s₁}(tense(C))` whose evaluation situation is the introduced `s₁`. The
anchor `s₀` is the dref `0`, the introduced situation the dref `1`, the main-clause situation
the dref `2`. -/

/-! ### Modal displacement

A restrictor carrying the Subordinate Future is true at a state iff some historical alternative
of the anchor, after it, satisfies it: the existence presupposition of a strong quantifier is
satisfied in a historical alternative, not at the anchor, which is why the continuation *I doubt
anyone will come at all* is felicitous. Under the indicative it must be satisfied in the
anchor's world. -/

satisfying `A`. -/
