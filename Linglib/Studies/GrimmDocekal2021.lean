# Grimm and Dočekal (2021): Counting Aggregates, Groups and Kinds

Grimm and Dočekal account for the Czech morphology that counts aggregates, groups, and kinds. The
suffix *-í* derives strongly non-countable nouns from countable roots, *listí* 'foliage' from *list*
'leaf', which take no plural, no cardinal, and no packaging (`derived_aggregates_noncountable`); the
group numeral *-ice* yields a countable group, *dvě trojice námořníků* 'two groups of three
sailors', whereas the aggregate numeral *-oje* and the taxonomic numeral *-ojí* yield phrases that
no outer cardinal or universal quantifier can take (`complex_numerals_uncounted`); *-oje* selects
nouns whose referents come in connected sets (`aggregate_numeral_selects`); and Czech nouns are
inflexible, with no grinding and a taxonomic plural confined to non-episodic contexts where the
taxonomic numeral is free (`taxonomic_plural_nonepisodic`). Section 5 extends Krifka's nominal
semantics with Landman's groups for *-ice* and with Grimm's mereotopology for *-í* and *-oje*: a
cluster is a sum of entities transitively connected through entities of their kind
(`Mereology.IsCluster`), a maximal cluster absorbs every cluster it overlaps, *-oje* counts the
maximal clusters below its argument, whose number is therefore determinate (`ojeSem_determinate`),
and *-ojí* counts subkinds and so fails on a kind-less argument (`oji_needs_subkinds`).

## Implementation notes

The connection relation is a parameter, the paper's proximate or external connectedness, which (63)
binds existentially; the cluster of (61) uses a finite set of members and its supremum. The group
numeral is stated over the library's `Plurality.GroupStructure`, whose `up` packs a sum into an
atom, which is why a group can be counted again. The paper's Table 1, the twenty-two nouns derived
by *-í*, is lexical data for the Czech Fragment and is not retyped here.

Table 1's derived aggregates belong in `Fragments/Slavic/Czech/`; Krifka's kind and object unit
operators of section 4 are not formalized.

/-! ### The three numerals, sections 4.2 and 5

The aggregate numeral counts clusters, section 5.2. Connection is reflexive and symmetric ((56),
(57)) and whatever is connected to a part is connected to the whole (58): the axioms of
`Mereology.IsConnection`, from which overlap entails connection ((59),
`Mereology.IsConnection.of_overlap`). A cluster ((60), (61)) is `Mereology.IsCluster`, the sum of
entities of a property any two of which are transitively connected through such entities. Inside a
connected component clusters are cumulative (`Mereology.cum_isClusterIn`), the cumulativity of *-í*
nouns, *listí* and *listí* making *listí*; a maximal cluster absorbs every cluster it overlaps (63),
so two maximal clusters do not overlap (`Mereology.disjointPred_isMaxCluster`), the paper's remark
after (63). -/

/-! ### Three leaves in a row

The leaves of *listí* need only be proximately connected, section 5.2.1. Three leaves lie in a
row, each near its neighbours: the outer two are not near each other, yet their sum is a cluster,
since they are transitively connected through the middle leaf, which (61) lets lie outside the
cluster. Without the middle leaf the outer two form no cluster. -/

/-- Two sums are near when they contain the same or neighbouring leaves. -/
