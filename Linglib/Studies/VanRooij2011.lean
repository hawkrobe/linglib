# van Rooij (2011): Measurement and Interadjective Comparisons

A measure is unique up to a group of transformations, and a statement about measures is
meaningful when every such transformation preserves its truth. Van Rooij measures
individual–adjective pairs on one scale, so that *x is P-er than y is Q* compares two values of a
single measure, and asks which transformations that measure is unique up to when one
transformation applies to every adjective: comparing pairs needs only a co-ordinal scale, a
differential across adjectives a co-interval scale, and a factor across adjectives a co-ratio scale.
If each adjective's scale is unique up to its own transformations, no comparison across adjectives
is meaningful. Bale's universal degrees normalize each adjective's ranking, and so make even ratios
across adjectives meaningful from merely ordinal measures, which van Rooij counts against them.

## Main statements

* `comparative_ordinalLevel`, `not_comparative_ordinal`: *x is P-er than y is Q* survives one
  strictly increasing map applied to every adjective, but not a separate map per adjective.
* `differential_cardinalFull`, `factor_ratioFull`, `not_factor_cardinalFull`: a differential
  across adjectives holds up to a common change of unit and origin, a factor across adjectives up to
  a common change of unit, and not up to a change of origin.
* `factor_universal_ordinal`: read through universal degrees, a factor across adjectives survives
  a separate strictly increasing map per adjective.
* `differenceComparative_cardinalUnit`: comparing differences on two adjectives survives a common
  unit with a separate origin per adjective, the weaker co-interval scale of the paper's note 17.

## Implementation notes

* A measure on individual–adjective pairs is a profile of `Degree.Aggregation` with adjectives as
  dimensions, following the paper's analogy with interpersonal comparisons of utility. The
  co-ordinal, co-interval and co-ratio scales are Sen's comparability classes `ordinalLevel`,
  `cardinalFull` and `ratioFull`, and separate scales per adjective are `ordinal`.
* Measures are real-valued, as in the paper; universal degrees are rational.

## TODO

* Section 2's choice structures, after van Benthem, and section 4.3's constructions of a
  co-ordinal scale from a choice function on pairs and from Klein's modifiers.
