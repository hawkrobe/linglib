# Funakoshi (2016): Verb-Stranding Verb Phrase Ellipsis in Japanese

This file formalizes [funakoshi-2016]'s argument that Japanese has verb-stranding verb phrase
ellipsis. Adjuncts in Japanese were held never to be null; the paper shows that a manner,
instrumental or temporal adjunct is understood as null when the clause-mate object is null too or
the clause is intransitive, and never when an object stays overt, unless that object is
contrastively focused (its generalizations (12) and (59)). *Pro* and argument ellipsis reach
arguments only, so a null adjunct needs ellipsis of the verb phrase with the verb raised out of
it: [E] on Voice in the clausal spine of `Minimalist.Ellipsis` ([merchant-2001]), the verb
stranded above it. Everything in the site goes, so the object goes with the adjunct or escapes by
scrambling, and an object scrambled out of the site is a pseudogapping remnant, which must be
contrastively focused. Reason adverbial clauses scope above negation and so sit above the site;
they cannot be null even beside a null object. `NullAdjunct` states the derivation of the reading
and `nullAdjunct_iff` reads the generalizations off the spine: the adjunct attaches inside the
verb phrase and the object is not an unfocused overt remnant. The rival that keeps argument
ellipsis as the only strategy, the oblique movement of the adjunct onto a null argument,
undergenerates in intransitive clauses and overgenerates with null subjects and with reason
clauses (`rows_not_oblique`), and argument ellipsis alone derives no null adjunct at all. The
rows are the paper's ellipsis clauses under the null adjunct reading (`rows_predicted`).

## Implementation notes

* The paper's (40), where *okurete* 'late' resists the null reading in an intransitive clause,
  is left out: the paper attributes it to the adverb's degradation under negation in non-elliptical
  sentences as well.
* An overt object is recorded as contrastively focused or not; givenness is not recorded, so the
  functional account of §2.1, which the paper refutes with the new objects of (26) and (27), stays
  in the prose.
* The examples are `Data.Examples.Funakoshi2016`.
