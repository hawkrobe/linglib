# Pantcheva (2011): Decomposing Path

This file formalizes the syncretism typology of the ninth chapter of [pantcheva-2011]. The
directional heads Place, Goal, Source, and Route form the containment sequence of
`Case.PathDir`, and a syncretism pattern over the four is a paradigm over that sequence
(`Pattern`). Two constraints restrict the patterns: the *ABA generalization of Bobaljik
([bobaljik-2012], then circulating in manuscript), on which a syncretism targets only
adjacent heads of the sequence, the same contiguity that governs nominal case in
[caha-2009] (`Morphology.IsContiguous`); and *A&¬A, on which Goal and Source never share a
marker, because the Source head is the locus of a reversal of the Goal path (§5.4), so one
marker for both would be contradictory (`GoalSourceMerged`, `goalSource_distinct_denotation`).
Together they say exactly that no syncretism crosses the seam between Goal and Source
(`possible_iff_respectsSeam`), which cuts the fifteen set-partitions of the four roles to the
four attested patterns, Types 1 to 4 of Table 9.2: Place and Goal may merge, Source and Route
may merge, and nothing else (`possible_syncretisms`). Seven of the eleven excluded patterns
fall to *ABA and the other four to *A&¬A, Table 9.3 (`aba_excluded`, `ana_excluded`). The
containment itself is visible where the Source marker contains the Goal marker, as in
Imbabura Quechua *-man* against *-man-da* (Table 4.2, `source_contains_goal`), and Georgian
instantiates Type 3, with Location and Goal syncretic (Table 9.1, `georgian_loc_goal_possible`).

## Implementation notes

The patterns are restricted-growth strings over the four positions, one representative per
set-partition; the seam characterization is proved for every pattern, and the enumerations
are its corollaries. The attested lexicalization patterns of §9.3.1 are described in prose.
