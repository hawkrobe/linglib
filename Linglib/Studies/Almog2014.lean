# Almog (2014): Referential Mechanics

This file formalizes the formal core of [almog-2014]. Rigid designation and directly
referential content are separated by Kaplan's `dthat`: `dthat[the φ]` designates rigidly and
so is scope-inert (`dthat_deRe_iff_deDicto`), yet two descriptions that co-denote at the
context world rigidify to one content (`dthat_eq_dthat_of_eq`), so rigidity alone leaves the
informativeness of an identity unexplained, while a structured singular proposition keeps the
individuals apart (`SingularProposition.mk_ne_mk_of_ne`). Co-referential rigid designators
have the same content, `IsRigid.eq_of_apply_eq`, which is the book's "no entailments" thesis:
direct reference assigns *Cicero is Cicero* and *Cicero is Tully* one proposition and is
silent on whether it is necessary or believed. Donnellan's referential use is a different
mechanism from rigidification: reference fixed by contact with the object before any
description is deployed is the constant character, and it diverges from `dthat` of the
description whenever the description misfits (`const_ne_dthat_of_ne`). The Russell–Partee–
Kaplan challenge is the type gap between referential and quantificational subjects: the
Montague lift `Quantification.individual` is injective (`individual_injective`) but the
universal quantifier is not in its image (`not_exists_individual_eq_forall`), so a subject of
type `E` cannot serve *every philosopher*.

## Implementation notes

The book's taxonomy of three mechanisms of direct reference (designation, singular
proposition, referential use), whose pairwise independence it argues expression by
expression, is not formalized: a profile assigned to an expression by fiat is not derivable
from its semantics, so nothing would be proved about it.
