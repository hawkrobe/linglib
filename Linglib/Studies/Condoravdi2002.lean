# Condoravdi 2002: Temporal Interpretation of Modals

Non-root modals expand the time of evaluation forward and instantiate the property in their
scope in the worlds of a modal base. Modals for the past are the same modals over the perfect,
so *might have* is ambiguous between the modal over the perfect, an epistemic possibility about
the past, and the perfect over the modal, a metaphysical possibility from a past perspective.
Frame adverbials follow from intersecting the reference interval with the period named, *still*
and *already* over a modal from the shrinking of live options as time advances, and the choice
of modal base from the diversity condition, which a settled issue fails. The operators are
stated over closed intervals of times that may run to the end of time.

## Implementation notes

* The paper's *now* is an interval, albeit a short one, taken here as a point, and a modal base
  is indexed by the start of the reference interval; the paper's `MB(w, t)` takes an interval
  and its `w ≃_t w'` a point.
* Identity of the past enters as `FixesPast`, discharged for histories built from dated facts
  by `fixesPast_eventive` and `fixesPast_stative`; the counterfactual implication rests on
  the paper's footnote assumption `PastAlternativesOutside`.
* The sortal restriction of *already*, *yet* and *still* is partiality, and only the
  prior-phase half of their Löbner presuppositions is stated.

## TODO

* The embedded modals of *Mary believed that John may get sick* are informal in the paper and
  absent here.
* *He has still won* is excluded by the paper as well known rather than derived; the German
  *noch* pattern that rests on it is a row, not a theorem.
* `WOLL` is stated but unconsumed: the paper gives no data for *will* and *would*.

/-! ### The three readings -/

/-- A modal for the present with an eventive predicate, *he might run*, holds when some world of the
base at the present has the event starting no earlier than the present. Future orientation is
obligatory. -/
theorem pres_may_eventive_iff :
    PRES now (MAY MB (.eventive P)) w ↔ ∃ w' ∈ MB w now, ∃ e, P w' e ∧ now ≤ (τ e).fst := by
  simp

/-- A modal for the present with a stative predicate, *he might be here*, holds when some world of
the base at the present has the state persisting at or past the present. The state may have started
earlier, so future orientation is optional. -/
theorem pres_may_stative_iff :

/-- The modal over the perfect, *he may have won*, holds when some world of the base at the present
has the event ending before the present. This is the epistemic reading, with present perspective and
past orientation. -/
theorem pres_may_perf_eventive_iff :
    PRES now (MAY MB (PERF (.eventive P))) w ↔
      ∃ w' ∈ MB w now, ∃ e, P w' e ∧ (τ e).snd < now := by
  simp

/-- The perfect over the modal, *he might have won*, holds when some past time has, in some world of

/-! ### Frame adverbials -/

/-- A modal for the present rejects a period wholly before the present, *he may win yesterday*,
since the forward interval meets it in the null interval. -/

/-- The modal over the perfect rejects a period lying at or after the present, *he must have been
available next month* and *it must have been raining now*, since the interval the perfect supplies
precedes the present, and so the period. -/

/-! ### Live options shrink -/

/-- A possibility at a time was a possibility at every earlier time, since the metaphysical base
widens backward and the forward interval lengthens. This is why *still*, whose presupposition is a
prior positive phase, scopes over a possibility modal, *he may still win*, and *already*, whose
presupposition is a prior negative phase, cannot, *he may already win*; read backward, it is why *he
may win this game* is false once he has lost. -/

merely consistent with the shrinking of possibilities, as the paper puts it, but entailed by
the assertion, given any earlier time. -/
