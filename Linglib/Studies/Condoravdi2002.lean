# Condoravdi 2002: Temporal Interpretation of Modals

Non-root modals expand the time of evaluation forward and instantiate the property in their
scope in the worlds of a modal base. Modals for the past are the same modals over the perfect,
so *might have* is ambiguous between the modal over the perfect, an epistemic possibility about
the past, and the perfect over the modal, a metaphysical possibility from a past perspective.
Frame adverbials follow from intersecting the reference interval with the period named,
*still* and *already* over a modal from the shrinking of live options as time advances, and
the choice of modal base from the diversity condition, which a settled issue fails. We state
the paper's operators over closed intervals of times that may run to the end of time, derive
the three readings, the adverbial patterns in a model, the *still* ~ *already* asymmetry, the
settledness of non-future instantiation and the counterfactual implication, and check the
paper's examples as rows.

## Implementation notes

* The paper's *now* is an interval, albeit a short one, taken here as a point, and a modal base
  is indexed by the start of the reference interval; the paper's `MB(w, t)` takes an interval
  and its `w ≃_t w'` a point.
* Identity of the past enters as `FixesPast`, discharged for histories built from dated facts
  by `fixesPast_eventive` and `fixesPast_stative`; the counterfactual implication rests on
  the paper's footnote assumption `PastAlternativesOutside`.
* The sortal restriction of *already*, *yet* and *still* is partiality, and only the
  prior-phase half of their Löbner presuppositions is stated.

## TODO

* The embedded modals of *Mary believed that John may get sick* are informal in the paper and
  absent here.
* *He has still won* is excluded by the paper as well known rather than derived; the German
  *noch* pattern that rests on it is a row, not a theorem.
* `WOLL` is stated but unconsumed: the paper gives no data for *will* and *would*.

widens backward and the forward interval lengthens. This is why *still*, whose presupposition
