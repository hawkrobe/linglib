# Pancheva (2003): Aspectual Makeup of Perfect Participles and the Interpretations of the Perfect

Pancheva gives the perfect one meaning: a perfect time span of which the reference interval is a
final subinterval. The readings come from the viewpoint aspect the perfect embeds. The unbounded
aspect, the span inside the run time of an event, gives the universal perfect; the neutral, the
span overlapping an event that starts after it does, and the bounded, the run time properly
inside the span, give two experiential perfects; and a resultative aspect over telic predicates,
the span overlapping into the run time of the event's result state, gives the resultative
perfect. Greek lacks the universal perfect because its perfect does not embed the unbounded
aspect. When the span may start arbitrarily early the experiential and resultative perfects say
only how the eventuality or the result state stands to the right boundary of the reference
interval, and at a moment of reference the universal and the two experiential perfects are the
three perfects of the older account by Iatridou, Anagnostopoulou and Izvorski.

## Main statements

* `universal_iff_unbounded`, `universal_at_rb`: the universal perfect asserts the eventuality
  throughout the reference interval.
* `neutral_experiential_iff`, `bounded_experiential_iff`: the neutral experiential says the
  eventuality has begun by the right boundary of the reference interval, the bounded one that it
  has ended by it.
* `resultative_state_at_rb`, `resultative_perfect_iff`: the resultative perfect asserts the
  result state at the right boundary and beyond.
* `bounded_perfect_iff_prfv_perfect`: the proper containment of the bounded aspect makes no
  difference under the perfect.
* `bounded_experiential_of_ends_at_rb`: the bounded experiential is compatible with the
  eventuality holding at the moment of reference.
* `universal_iff_durative_unbounded`, `neutral_experiential_iff_inclusive_unbounded`,
  `bounded_experiential_iff_inclusive_bounded`: at a moment of reference the three perfects are
  those of Iatridou, Anagnostopoulou and Izvorski.
* `neutral_span_not_covered`, `bounded_span_not_covered`: without the unbounded aspect no perfect
  is universal.

## Implementation notes

* The perfect is `Aspect.perfect` and the unbounded aspect `Aspect.UNBOUNDED`. The
  neutral relation of (7b) is strict, the interval having a point before every point of the
  event, so it is not Smith's neutral viewpoint `ViewpointType.neutral`, which lets the interval
  start with the event (`neutral_subset_smith_neutral`).
* The resultative takes a predicate of result states and their events, which only telic
  predicates denote, so an activity such as *run* in (5) has no resultative perfect by its type.
  The paper's formula (17) reads only the run time of the state.
* Theorems that let the perfect time span start before any given time assume that time has no
  first moment (`NoMinOrder`); without a perfect-level adverbial, which the paper's formulas do
  not include, the left boundary of the span is free.

## TODO

* The claim that (16a–b) are incompatible with the utterance time lying in the event time does
  not follow from (15b): an event ending exactly at the utterance time satisfies it
  (`bounded_experiential_of_ends_at_rb`), as footnote 8's remark on endpoints anticipates. What
  follows is that the event does not continue past it (`bounded_experiential_not_beyond_rb`).
* The spell-out tables (20)–(21), the sequence-of-tense contrasts (24)–(25) and (37)–(39), and
  the parallelism argument (31) are left in prose; the paper proposes no formal account of the
  latter two.
* Perfect-level adverbials such as *since 2000* in (1a) are not part of the paper's formulas.
