# Iatridou (2000): The grammatical ingredients of counterfactuality

This file formalizes [iatridou-2000]'s account of the past morphology of counterfactuals as
an exclusion feature. The feature's skeletal meaning (49) is that the topic excludes what,
for all the speaker knows, is the speaker's: over times the topic time excludes the utterance
time, temporal past, and over worlds the topic worlds exclude the actual worlds,
counterfactuality (`Excludes`). What is asserted is a relation to the topic, not to the
situation, so the counterfactual inference is cancellable and *John was in the classroom; in
fact he still is* is consistent (`Claim.consistent_with_inclusion`). The library's
`Modality.Exclusion.ExclF` on context towers is the feature at a point-sized topic
(`exclF_iff_excludes`).

One feature over worlds leaves the rest of the antecedent to be evaluated as with present
tense, so the future less vivid and the present counterfactual readings are the future and
present evaluation times of the predicate's Aktionsart: Table 1 is Table 2 (`readings`), and
the pluperfect's second layer makes a past counterfactual whatever the predicate. Aspect and
mood are not ingredients: the imperfective of Greek and French is absent from English
(`imperfective_not_universal`), and the subjunctive appears in a counterfactual only where a
past subjunctive paradigm lets it co-occur with the feature, so French, having lost its past
subjunctive, keeps the past indicative (`antecedent_french`).

## Implementation notes

* Exclusion is disjointness of sets of times or worlds, the speaker's coordinate being a set
  of epistemically accessible alternatives; the *before* of temporal past is `TemporalPast`.
* The counterfactual types keep the name `CounterfactualType`, which `Mizuno2024` refers to.
