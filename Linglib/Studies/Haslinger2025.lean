# Haslinger (2025): Pragmatic constraints on imprecision and homogeneity

Haslinger argues that the availability of imprecise construals is regulated not in the lexicon
but by alternatives, through two constraints. No Needless Manner Violations combines two Manner
preferences, for lower structural complexity and for less potential for imprecision, as Pareto
dominance, and blocks a sentence that a potentially p-equivalent alternative dominates. Inference
Preservation blocks an imprecise construal of a subexpression that loses an inference, entailment
or incompatibility, that its precise construal licenses about an alternative.

## Main results

* `lt_complexity_of_lt_potential`: an unblocked expression more imprecise than a competitor is
  strictly simpler, the form–meaning correlation behind *the doors* and *all the doors*.
* `forall_not_violates_iff`: a bare numeral survives Inference Preservation exactly when its
  deviation is under half the lcm of the widths of the scales it lies on, so *99* must be exact
  while *100* tolerates deviations under twenty-five (`ninetyNine_hundred`).
* `roundness_depends_on_scales`: *180* is rounder than *200* among angles and *200* than *180*
  among cardinals, (80b,c).
* `conjunction_violates`: a conjunction read non-maximally loses the entailment of its conjuncts.

## Implementation notes

The Manner orderings are read off two natural-number measures on an abstract sentence type, with
potential p-equivalence a relation parameter, since the dissertation's (68) quantifies over
contexts that differ only in the issue parameter. Degree expressions are construals over `ℚ`, the
precise interpretation the exact value and the imprecise one the halo of a contextual deviation
`m`, (69)–(70). The conventionalized scales of §6.2.1 are sets of expressions; here a scale is the
multiples of its width over the numerals' values, given by the widths salient in a context, so
roundness, (22), is `Numerals.Roundness.AtLeastAsRound` over `Numerals.Roundness.OnScale`.
The dissertation's examples are the rows of `Data/Examples/Haslinger2025.json`; its
Ch. 5 extensions to presupposition and redundancy and the collective exceptions of Ch. 7 are not
modelled.
