# Bale and Schwarz (2026): Natural language and external conventions: re-examining per

*Per*-phrases come in two kinds. Saturating a predicate of a simplex dimension, as in *this
sample weighs thirteen grams per milliliter*, they compose in the grammar, and both Coppock's
entry for *per* and the anaphoric entry of the 2022 paper can be restated with pure numbers and
multiplication alone, so neither commits the grammar to the quantity division that the No Division
Hypothesis denies it. Saturating a predicate of a quotient dimension, as in *the density of that
sample is thirteen grams per milliliter*, they are math speak, verbalizations of the term
`13 g/mL` whose meaning comes from the external notation as a mixed quotation's does. A
verbalization such as *thirteen gee over em el* substitutes only for math speak, and
only a composed *per*-PP can be fronted. Both facts reduce to dimensions: a composed
*per*-phrase has its head unit's dimension, so it can be a weight but never a density, while
`13 g/mL` is a density and never a weight.

## Main statements

* `existsUnique_pure_mul`: the pure number the anaphoric *per* denotes is the unique `n` with
  `n ⋅ r = μ(y)`, so the entry needs no division.
* `coppockPer_much_iff`: Coppock's entry and the anaphoric measure phrase derive the same truth
  conditions.
* `ratio_eq_mathSpeak_iff`, `ratio_ne_anaphoricMP`, `not_much_mathSpeak`: a predicate of a
  quotient dimension accepts the verbalized quotient and never a composed *per*-phrase, and a
  predicate of a simplex dimension never accepts the verbalized quotient.
* `rows_dimension`: the *per*-phrase's dimension matches the predicate's exactly in the
  felicitous examples.
