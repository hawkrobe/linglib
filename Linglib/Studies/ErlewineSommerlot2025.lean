# Erlewine and Sommerlot (2025): Voice and Extraction in Malayic

This file formalizes the account of voice and Ā-extraction in Malayic in
[erlewine-sommerlot-2025]. The verbal domain has two heads, after Nomoto: v, which introduces the
agent and licenses one nominal, and Voice, which heads a phase with exactly one nominal specifier.
Every nominal is licensed by v or by T, so the nominal that v leaves unlicensed moves through
Spec,VoiceP to the subject position. Each clause's Minimalist derivation is built from its
parameters, and its VoiceP and CP Spell-outs, read off the derivation as Fox and Pesetsky's cyclic
linearization reads them, are the paper's snapshots. Vocabulary items realize Voice and v by their
adjacency at VoiceP Spell-out, a null Voice is pruned from the ordering statements, and a clause
is grammatical when it is licensed, meets the EPP and the vocabulary, affixes an overt Voice to
the verb, and linearizes.

The subject-only restriction on Ā-extraction follows, and so does its exception: a nominal other
than the agent can be extracted while the agent raises or stays low only when Voice is null, since
an overt Voice is ordered before the agent at VoiceP and after it at CP (57); the agent of a bare
passive cannot be extracted across its theme (60); *N-* on v rather than Voice allows object
extraction (§5.2); and the registers of Madurese differ in whether Voice has a null allomorph
(§5.3). The six grammars predict the judgments of the paper's examples.

## Main statements

* `ErlewineSommerlot2025.Clause.spellouts_eq`: the derivations spell out the paper's VoiceP and
  CP snapshots.
* `ErlewineSommerlot2025.rows_grammatical`: the grammars predict every example's judgment.
* `ErlewineSommerlot2025.overt_voice_paradox`: an overt Voice blocks the order-preserving
  extraction of two nominals (57).

## Implementation notes

* A clause is its syntactic parameters, and the exponents of Voice and v are chosen after VoiceP
  Spell-out. v+V is one complex head, the paper not showing V-to-v movement, and one terminal
  stands for T with its auxiliaries.
* The active v always projects its agent (30). The ban on an agent licensed by the passive v
  moving to Spec,VoiceP is the antilocality the paper tentatively suggests (§3.3).
* Desa's T licenses a nominal in situ instead of attracting one under nominal Ā-extraction (§3.3).
  Kuching Malay's Voice is always null, and Jakarta Indonesian's *di-* passive is taken from
  Standard Indonesian (§5.2).
* Ditransitive, possessor and embedded-argument extraction (§4.4), ellipsis (§4.5) and the
  Kendayan passives (§5.2) are not modelled.
