# Itô and Mester (2009): The Extended Prosodic Word

This file formalizes the prosodification of function-word complexes in [ito-mester-2009]. A
function word followed by its lexical host, English *the dinosaurs* or German *'ne Zigarette*,
has the four prosodic sites of (25): a prosodic word of its own, fusion into the host's word,
adjunction to the host's word, and attachment to the phonological phrase, (20a)–(20d). Each site
violates exactly one of the constraints FtBin, Lex-to-ω, No-Recursion and Parse-into-ω, so the
factorial typology of the four constraints yields the four sites (`fullOmega_optimum` and its
three siblings). With FtBin and Lex-to-ω undominated, the tableaux (33) and (34) leave adjunction
and phrase attachment tied, and the ranking of Parse-into-ω above No-Recursion, which the
evidence of Section 3 supports for English and German, selects the recursive word
`[ω fnc [ω lex]]` (`omegaAdjunction_optimum`), against [selkirk-1996]'s phrase attachment.

## Implementation notes

* Candidates are `Prosody.Tree`s and constraints `Constraint Tree` values: No-Recursion is the
  substrate's `Prosody.noRec` and Parse-into-ω its `Prosody.parseInto`; FtBin at the word level
  and Lex-to-ω are defined here, the latter for the fixed lexical word `lexω`.
* The tableau engine is `OptimalityTheory.Tableau.ofRanking`; the winning recursive structure
  is a legal prosodic word of the substrate, No-Recursion being violable.
