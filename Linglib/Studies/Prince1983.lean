# Prince (1983): Relating to the Grid

Prince argues that the metrical grid alone, without the labelled tree, carries the theory of
stress. For a uniformly labelled tree, Liberman and Prince's Relative Prominence Projection Rule
says what the End Rule says, so the labelling does no work. Two grid entries clash when they are
adjacent at a level with no entry one level down between them, and the Rhythm Rule is Move x,
which slides a clashing entry within its level and can never move the peak of a phrase. Word
stress is built from the End Rule at an edge, extrametricality, Perfect Grid Construction sweeping
from an edge, and bipositional heavy syllables; together they derive the alternating systems of
Garawa, Hawaiian and Winnebago and the quantity-sensitive systems of (98).

## Main statements

* `SWTree.uniformWS_rppr_iff`: under uniform labelling the RPPR is the End Rule.
* `moveXL_getD_peak`, `Marks.not_isContinuous_move`: Move x never moves the peak, since the move
  would leave a hole in a column.
* `postpeninitial_iff`, `antepenultimate_iff`: stress three syllables from an edge comes only from
  extrametricality and a trough-first sweep from that edge.
* `hawaiian_eq`, `hawaiian_ne_alternating`: Hawaiian's initial dactyl needs the End Rule at both
  edges before the sweep, and no perfect grid gives it.

## Implementation notes

* A grid is the substrate's `Prosody.Grid`, a list of column heights, so the Continuous Column
  Constraint holds by construction.
* The End Rule applies to the highest level present below the level it maps into, the reading of
  §3.7; without Forward Clash Override it withholds a promotion that would clash.
* Perfect Grid Construction is a greedy sweep that raises a column when neither neighbour is
  stressed, a trough start behaving as if a stress preceded the edge.
* The edges and directions of (119) are `Edge` and `ScanDirection`; the End Rule, Perfect Grid
  Construction and Move x run right to left as the `List.revConj` mirror images of their
  left-to-right versions. A syllable of two or more moras is bipositional.

## TODO

The End Rule (Final) inside the stress level that makes Garawa's penultimate stress secondary
rather than tertiary, Mora Sluicing, the Forward Clash Override option of Perfect Grid
Construction, the bounding of Move x in §2.2, the extrametrical systems of (99), the feet of §4,
and the pitch-accent systems of §5 are not formalized.
