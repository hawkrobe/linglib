# Theiler (2021): Denn as a Highlighting-Sensitive Particle

This file formalizes [theiler-2021]'s account of the German discourse particle *denn* in polar
questions, wh-questions and conditional antecedents. The particle is discourse-anaphoric: it
picks up a salient previous move or piece of contextual information, (6)–(9). It is sensitive
not to the answerhood conditions of its clause but to the clause's highlighted content in the
sense of [roelofsen-farkas-2015], the n-place property with n the number of wh-elements: in
the Two Annas scenario, (4), a wh-question and a polar question with the same answerhood
conditions differ in whether *denn* is felicitous. The felicity condition, (19) and (37), is
that the speaker considers learning an instantiation of a highlighted property a necessary
precondition for proceeding from the previous move, where proceeding from an imperative is
carrying it out, from a question answering it, and from an assertion accepting it (section 3.3).

The account is formalized over information states. A proposition's instantiations are the
values of the highlighted property, `instantiations`, a single proposition for a declarative or
polar question, `instantiations_zero`; `Denn` states that every state from which the speaker
proceeds has learned one of the highlighted instantiations. For a polar question this is
necessity of the highlighted proposition itself, `denn_singleton`, so two questions with the
same resolution conditions can differ, `denn_pair_not_denn_singleton`: the wh-question of Two
Annas is felicitous where the polar question, which shares its meaning `polar_eq_sup`, is
not. Disjoined *denn*-questions, (32a), are infelicitous because each disjunct signals that
learning it suffices and a sufficient precondition is not necessary,
`not_denn_of_sufficient_of_sufficient`, while conjoined ones, (32c), name two necessary
preconditions, `denn_singleton_and_denn_singleton_iff`; an alternative question, which
highlights both disjuncts, licenses *denn* more demandingly than the polar disjunctive question
highlighting their disjunction, `denn_pair_imp_denn_union`. In a conditional antecedent *denn*
marks the antecedent as necessary for the consequent, which the conditional makes sufficient,
so the conditional is perfected, `perfection`, and a disjunctive antecedent cannot carry
*denn*, `subset_of_disjunctive_antecedent`. The modalized condition (73), that the speaker
considers it possible that learning an instantiation is necessary for the recipient, reduces to
(19) in questions, where the recipient is the speaker, because possible necessity is necessity
over the speaker's doxastic accessibility, `felicity_question`.

## Implementation notes

Proceeding is a predicate on information states, the states from which the speaker can act
as the previous move indicated; the paper's five clauses defining it by the form of the move
are left to prose. Learning a proposition is the state's entailing it. The modalized condition
is stated over the accessibility relations of the interlocutors' doxastic states, assumed to be
KD45 frames as in doxastic logic, whence the collapse of `◇□` to `□` that the paper assumes as
full introspection. The treatment of *überhaupt* (section 5), the causal conjunction (section
6) and the comparison with Csipak and Zobel are not formalized beyond the modalized condition.
The examples are the rows of `Data.Examples.Theiler2021`.
