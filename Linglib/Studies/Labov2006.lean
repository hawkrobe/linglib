# Labov (2006): The Social Stratification of English in New York City

Labov's survey of the Lower East Side measures phonological variables by social class, by
contextual style from casual speech to minimal pairs, and by age. This file
states what the book reads off its printed tables: the stratification of three department
stores, the class and stylistic stratification of every variable except the lower class's (oh),
and the fit of each variable's table of age by class to Labov's models of a stigmatized feature,
stable or changing, and of an incoming prestige feature.

## Main statements

* `classDeviant_iff_styleDeviant`: a class group deviates from class stratification exactly when
  it deviates from stylistic stratification.
* `r_caseIIB`: (r) is distributed as a prestige feature in change.
* `ing_careful_caseIA`: (ing) in careful speech is distributed as a stable stigmatized feature.

## Implementation notes

* The printed tables are `Data/Experiments/Labov2006.json`. `Variable.toStandard` negates the
  (th) and (dh) indexes, which score stops and affricates above the prestige fricative, so that
  every signed index grows toward the standard.
* The models keep the cells the prose explains: an extreme word puts the lowest or highest class
  at that age's extreme, and a comparative compares the two ages within the middle-ranking
  classes. The lower class gets no age clause, being parenthesized in the model of a changing
  stigmatized feature and flat in the (r) table Labov matches to an incoming prestige feature.
* The deviation predicates use weak order, so the (æh) tie in word lists is no deviation, as the
  book reads it.

## TODO

* Change from below is not formalized: Labov reads (æh) as Case III-B from the lower-class rise
  and (oh) as Case III-A from the ethnic table, and the ethnic table of (æh) is not stored.
* The (r) crossover of the lower middle class appears only in figures over six class groups.
