# Eckert (2008): Variation and the indexical field

This file formalizes the indexical field of [eckert-2008]. On [silverstein-2003]'s indexical
order, a first-order index marks membership in a population and every nth-order value is
available for an n + 1st reconstrual, so the paper takes the meaning of a variable to be not a
fixed category but the constellation of ideologically linked meanings that continual
reconstrual creates, any of which a situated use may activate. An ideological field records
what each meaning is available to be construed as (`IdeologicalField`), a reconstrual adds
those construals to a set of meanings, and the indexical field of a first-order index is its
closure under reconstrual, a closure operator whose closed sets are the sets no reconstrual
extends.

The examples are the paper's. [labov-1963]'s Martha's Vineyard (ay) is an indicator become a
marker. The (ING) field of Figure 3, after [campbell-kibler-2007], holds favourable and
unfavourable meanings for both variants, and a hearer expects the variant whose field holds
the impression formed of the speaker. The stances of the /t/ release field of Figure 4 accrete
into qualities, social types anchor the field, and [podesva-2007]'s diva combines the two
extremes of the articulation continuum. Among the Belten High groups of Figure 1, the burnout
girls alone are among the leaders of every variable.

## Implementation notes

Figures 3 and 4 are recorded as printed and the ideological links as the text states them; the
graded strengths of `SocialMeaning.AssociationField` are not in the paper. `Leads` marks a group
among the greatest or second-greatest users of Figure 1 and is derived from the text's two
generalizations, that girls lead the older changes and burnouts the newer. The burned-out
burnout girls, the Beijing variables of Figure 2 from [zhang-2005], Podesva's release-rate
measurements and the (DH) discussion are not represented.
