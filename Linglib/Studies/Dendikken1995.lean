# den Dikken (1995): Particles

This file formalizes the analysis of verb-particle constructions in chapter 2 of den Dikken's
*Particles*. A particle is an ergative, non-lexical preposition heading a small clause in the
verb's complement, so the "object" of a verb-particle construction originates as the particle's
complement and receives no Case from it. The noun phrase is licensed in one of two ways. It
raises to the specifier of the particle's small clause, where the verb governs it, which gives the
outer order V-NP-Prt; or it stays in situ and receives the verb's Case through reanalysis of verb
and particle, an abstract incorporation that extends the verb's government by Baker's Government
Transparency Corollary, which gives the inner order V-Prt-NP. Reanalysis fails when the particle's
complement is a barrier, a nominal or adjectival small clause, when the noun phrase is a weak
pronoun, and when the particle carries a bare modifier such as *right*; placing the particle after
the predicate of the small clause has no derivation at all. The predicate of that small clause
extracts only across a verb-particle complex, the sole lexical governor of its trace.

Norwegian complex particle constructions pattern exactly as the English ones do, which den
Dikken takes to show that the analysis belongs to the core theory. Languages differ instead in
whether the particle may also incorporate overtly and surface as a prefix on the verb: never in
English, in the passive in Norwegian and Swedish, and in the active as well in Danish. The
chapter's English, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish examples are the rows of `Examples.all`, and
the calculus predicts the judgment of every row it covers.

## Main definitions

* `Complement`: the particle's complement, an object or a small clause headed by a lexical category.
* `Strategy`, `Strategy.placement`: raising, reanalysis and overt incorporation, and the placement
  of the particle each yields.
* `Licensed`, `Derivable`: the strategies a configuration licenses and the placements it derives.
* `PredicateExtractable`, `PredicateExtractableFrom`: extraction of the predicate of the inner
  small clause, by strategy and by placement.
* `Language.incorporates`: the voices, `Voice.active` or `Voice.passive`, in which a language
  incorporates its particles overtly.

## Main results

* `derivable_inner_iff`, `derivable_outer`, `not_derivable_final`, `derivable_prefixed_iff`: the
  placements a configuration derives.
* `complex_paradigm`, `weak_pronoun_outer_only`, `modified_outer_only`: the chapter's paradigms.
* `predicateExtractableFrom_iff`: the predicate extracts exactly from a derivable non-outer
  placement.
* `rows_derivable`, `rows_predicateExtraction`, `rows_subextraction`: every English and Norwegian
  row is judged as the calculus predicts.
* `rows_prefixed`: every prefixed particle is judged by the voices its language incorporates in.

## Implementation notes

The calculus is stated over the parameters the chapter's principles read, not over trees: the
particle's complement, with the infinitival marker *to* counted prepositional; whether the object
is a weak pronoun; whether the particle carries a bare modifier; and whether overt incorporation
is available. Overt incorporation is the third strategy, licensed by the language and the voice
alone, and the extracted predicate's trace is taken to be governed by the overtly incorporated
complex as by the reanalysed one, a point the chapter has no data on. Danish has no inner order,
which the chapter records without deriving, so the Danish rows enter only `rows_prefixed`. The
Bokmål rows were constructed and judged by Arnfinn Vonen and Alma Næss for den Dikken; the
Nynorsk rows are Åfarli's. The arguments from small-clause constituency, from verb-particle
idioms and from the ergativity of the particle, and Herslund's observation that Danish
incorporation is lexically conditioned, are recorded in the rows and not formalized.

/-! ### The English paradigms -/

/-- In (49)–(53), nominal and adjectival complex particle constructions have the outer order
only, prepositional and infinitival ones both, and none the clause-final order. -/
theorem complex_paradigm (overt : Prop) (c : CatFamily) :
    Derivable (.sc c) overt False False .outer ∧
      (Derivable (.sc c) overt False False .inner ↔ c = .adpositional) ∧
      ¬ Derivable (.sc c) overt False False .final :=
  ⟨derivable_outer _, by rw [derivable_inner_iff]; simp [Complement.IsBarrier],
    not_derivable_final _⟩

/-- In (155), a simplex construction has both orders with a full noun phrase, but *look up it*
has no derivation, since a weak pronoun cannot be Case-marked through the reanalysis chain; a
stressed, conjoined or deictic pronoun is not weak and patterns with full noun phrases, (156). -/
theorem weak_pronoun_outer_only (overt : Prop) :
    Derivable .np overt False False .inner ∧ Derivable .np overt True False .outer ∧
      ¬ Derivable .np overt True False .inner :=
  ⟨(derivable_inner_iff _).2 (by simp [Complement.IsBarrier]), derivable_outer _,
    fun h ↦ ((derivable_inner_iff _).1 h).2.1 trivial⟩

/-- In (161) and (162), the ban on weak pronouns carries over to the inner order of
prepositional and infinitival complex constructions, where the same reanalysis licenses the
in-situ noun phrase. -/

is not, (169), the modified particle being unable to incorporate. -/

  ⟨derivable_outer _, fun h ↦ ((derivable_inner_iff _).1 h).2.2 trivial⟩

/-! ### Extraction of the predicate of the inner small clause -/

/-- By (66), the trace of an extracted predicate of the inner small clause is lexically
governed, as the ECP demands, only by a verb-particle complex, reanalysed or overtly
incorporated, since the particle itself is not a lexical governor; subextraction from the
predicate is governed by the predicate's own head and always possible, (61), (63) and (65). -/
