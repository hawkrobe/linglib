# Merchant (2013): Voice and Ellipsis

This file formalizes Merchant's account of the uneven distribution of voice mismatches: an elided
VP may differ from its antecedent in voice under VP-ellipsis but not under sluicing, fragment
answers, gapping, stripping or pseudogapping. VP-ellipsis deletes vP, the complement of Voice, so
Voice is external to the ellipsis site and invisible to the identity condition, whereas the
clausal ellipses delete TP or more, which contains VoiceP. No argument-structure alternation,
causative, middle, dative or prepositional, survives any ellipsis, since the heads regulating them
sit at v or below and so inside every deletion domain. The paper's judgments are recorded as rows
and checked against `Ellipsis.Tolerates`, and Johnson's observation that only repetitive *again*
survives VP-ellipsis follows from the adjunction site of restitutive *again*.
