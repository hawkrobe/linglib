# Kalyakin (2026): VP ellipsis and argument structure alternations in Muira Dargwa

This file formalizes Kalyakin's argument that Muira Dargwa complex predicates show v-stranding
VP-ellipsis: the light verb survives while its complement, the VP containing the non-verbal root,
is elided. With [E] on v the deletion domain is smaller than that of English VP-ellipsis, so the
causative alternation, a difference in Voice over one root, is tolerated (§5) while the root must
still match, and both readings of *again* survive (§4.1), unlike English, where only the
repetitive one does. A root's position is read off its content, a state or a manner entailment in
Beavers and Koontz-Garboden's vocabulary: a root that imposes a manner on an activity attaches
to v rather than to the direct object and so lies outside the deletion domain, and antipassives
coerce a root into that position, which is why they resist ellipsis (§5). The NV-drop test shows
that the root and the argument go together, so the elided constituent is the VP (§3.6). The
paper's survey (§6) puts Persian and British *do* beside Muira Dargwa with [E] on v, and Bangla
with [E] on Voice, and finds that Persian, unlike Muira Dargwa, respects Goldberg's Verbal
Identity Requirement.

/-! ### Mismatch predictions -/

/-- The spine position of a root. A change-of-state root merges with the direct object, at V in
v's complement, and a manner root attaches to v, at the VP-adjunction site outside it (§2.2). -/
def rootSite : Semantics.Root.Position → SpinePosition
  | .complement => .V
  | .adjoined => .vpAdjunct


/-- The core prediction is that vVPE tolerates both voice and transitivity mismatches while
    blocking lexical verb mismatches. -/
theorem vVPE_mismatch_pattern :
    vStrandingVPE.Tolerates .voice ∧
    vStrandingVPE.Tolerates .transitivity ∧
    ¬ vStrandingVPE.Tolerates .lexical := by decide

/-- English VPE has a strictly more restrictive profile than vVPE, since it also blocks
transitivity mismatches. -/
theorem vpEllipsis_more_restrictive :
    ¬ vpEllipsis.Tolerates .transitivity ∧
    vStrandingVPE.Tolerates .transitivity := by decide

/-! ### The causative alternation under vVPE (§5)

The two alternants of a change-of-state root differ in the light verb alone, `[vDO, vBE]`
against `[vGO, vBE]` in [cuervo-2003]'s calculus, and share the VP below it. vVPE strands the
light verb and elides its complement, so the shared VP satisfies identity and the alternation is
tolerated; English VP-ellipsis deletes the vP, where v_trans ≠ v_unacc fails identity
([merchant-2013]). -/

/-- The causative alternant of a change-of-state root is a state under `vDO`. -/
def causative : List LittleV := [.vDO, .vBE]

/-- The inchoative alternant is the same state under `vGO`. -/
def inchoative : List LittleV := [.vGO, .vBE]

/-- The alternants differ in the light verb and share its complement, the VP. -/
theorem alternants_share_vp :
    LittleV.Causative causative ∧ LittleV.Inchoative inchoative ∧
      causative.tail = inchoative.tail ∧ causative ≠ inchoative := by
  decide

/-- The causative alternation is tolerated under vVPE because transitivity mismatches are
    allowed. -/
theorem causative_alternation_ok_under_vVPE :
    vStrandingVPE.Tolerates .transitivity := by decide

/-- The causative alternation is blocked under English VPE because transitivity mismatches are
    blocked. -/
theorem causative_alternation_blocked_english :
    ¬ vpEllipsis.Tolerates .transitivity := by decide

/-! ### Antipassive blocking -/

/-- Antipassive roots in Muira Dargwa are coerced to v-adjunction, outside vVPE's deletion domain,
    so they cannot be elided (§5). -/
theorem antipassive_blocks_vVPE : vStrandingVPE.Spares (rootSite .adjoined) := by decide

/-- Change-of-state roots, merged with the direct object, lie inside vVPE's deletion domain and
    can be elided. -/
theorem change_of_state_allows_vVPE : vStrandingVPE.Deletes (rootSite .complement) := by decide

/-! ### Cross-linguistic predictions -/

/-- Sluicing tolerates fewer mismatches than English VPE, which tolerates fewer than vVPE. -/
theorem mismatch_hierarchy :
    -- Sluicing: blocks both voice and transitivity
    ¬ sluicing.Tolerates .voice ∧
    ¬ sluicing.Tolerates .transitivity ∧
    -- English VPE: allows voice, blocks transitivity
    vpEllipsis.Tolerates .voice ∧
    ¬ vpEllipsis.Tolerates .transitivity ∧
    -- vVPE: allows both voice and transitivity
    vStrandingVPE.Tolerates .voice ∧
    vStrandingVPE.Tolerates .transitivity := by
  decide

/-- vVPE's [E] position, v, is strictly below English VPE's, Voice, so by Sailor's generalization
    any mismatch tolerated by English VPE is tolerated by vVPE. -/
theorem vVPE_below_vpEllipsis :
    vStrandingVPE.ePosition < vpEllipsis.ePosition := by decide

/-! ### The causative chain -/

/-- The alternants share their VP under distinct light verbs ([cuervo-2003]) and vVPE with [E]
on v elides the VP alone ([merchant-2013]), so the alternation is tolerated under vVPE. -/
theorem end_to_end_causative_chain :
    causative.tail = inchoative.tail ∧ causative ≠ inchoative ∧
      vStrandingVPE.Deletes (rootSite .complement) ∧ vStrandingVPE.Tolerates .transitivity := by
  decide

/-- Sluicing, with [E] on C, blocks voice mismatches under Merchant's theory too, since Voice
is inside TP, its deletion domain, as the Santa Cruz sluicing data set of Anand, Hardt and
McCloskey confirms independently. -/
theorem sluicing_voice_blocked_convergent :
    ¬ sluicing.Tolerates .voice := by decide

/-! ### The *again* diagnostic -/

/-- Under vVPE both the repetitive and the restitutive *again* survive, (52a–b), as both do
under Persian vVPE ([toosarvandani-2009] (90)), which confirms that the deletion domain is the
VP and not the vP. -/
theorem vVPE_both_again :
    vStrandingVPE.Spares AgainReading.repetitive.site ∧
      vStrandingVPE.Spares AgainReading.restitutive.site := by decide

/-- English VPE deletes restitutive *again*, so only the repetitive reading survives
([merchant-2013]). -/
theorem vpEllipsis_only_repetitive :
    vpEllipsis.Spares AgainReading.repetitive.site ∧
      ¬ vpEllipsis.Spares AgainReading.restitutive.site := by decide

/-- The *again* test separates vVPE from English VPE, whose deletion domains differ. -/
theorem again_distinguishes_vVPE_from_vpEllipsis :
    vStrandingVPE.Spares AgainReading.restitutive.site ∧
      ¬ vpEllipsis.Spares AgainReading.restitutive.site := by decide

/-! ### The position of a root by its content (§2.2, §4.1)

A non-verbal element is a bare root, and where it merges is fixed by its conceptual content: a
root describing the end state of a change-of-state event merges with the direct object, one
imposing a manner on an activity attaches to v. The roots of the paper's complex predicates carry
the state or manner entailment Kalyakin reads off them. -/
