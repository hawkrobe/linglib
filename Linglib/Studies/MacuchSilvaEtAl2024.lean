# Macuch Silva, Lorson, Franke, Cummins and Rohde (2024): Strategic Use of English Quantifiers

This file formalizes the argumentative-difficulty account of [macuch-silva-etal-2024]. Two
experiments have English speakers describe exam results, a number of correct answers out of a
total, under the goal of presenting the outcome as a success or as a failure, with the four
quantifiers *all*, *most*, *some* and *none* in Experiment 1. The difficulty of framing a
result toward a goal is the distance of its proportion of correct answers from the goal's
ideal: the proportion itself for a failure framing and its complement for a success framing
(`difficulty`), so the two difficulties of one table sum to one (`difficulty_add`). The
account predicts that as difficulty grows the speaker retreats to informationally weaker
quantifiers, *all* giving way to *most* and then to *some*, those truthful over broader ranges
of outcomes: truth is inherited down the lexical scale (`Truthful.of_le`), the strongest
truthful quantifier for the goal-congruent adjective is monotone in the count it describes
(`strongest_mono`), and difficulty orders those counts the other way, so the strongest
truthful quantifier weakens with difficulty (`weakening_with_difficulty`). The paper thereby
extends the argumentative strength of [cummins-franke-2021] from a property of the speaker's
utterance to a property of the situation.

## Implementation notes

Proportions and difficulties are rationals. The positive quantifiers form the scale ⟨some,
most, all⟩, ordered by rank, and *none* is the bottom adjoined to it (`WithBot`): the strongest
truthful quantifier is *none* exactly when the count is zero. The paper's refined difficulty,
which also counts the students scoring zero, and the response probabilities of Figure 5 are
described in prose.
