# [pesetsky-2013] — Russian Case Morphology and the Syntactic Categories

Pesetsky's central thesis: **morphological case is the realization of a
syntactic part-of-speech category**. The four major cases line up with
the four traditional lexical categories, formalized here as a
restriction of Minimalism's `Cat`:

| Case          | POS category | Assigner                                  |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Genitive      | N            | every noun (Primeval Genitive, p. 9)      |
| Nominative    | D            | the D head of a DP                        |
| Accusative    | V            | a transitive V (under VACC, eq. 77 p. 66) |
| Obliques      | P            | a P head; DAT canonical exemplar (p. 7)   |

Pesetsky writes (book p. 7): "only the distinctions among these oblique
cases in Russian will fail to correspond to a traditional
part-of-speech distinction" — P_OBL is canonical, P_DAT is one
exemplar with additional features. `POSCat.cases` returns the Russian
oblique series for `.P` (DAT/INS/LOC, matching
`Russian.Case.caseInventory`); `POSCat.canonicalExemplar`
picks DAT.

## Architecture: layered grounding on Minimalism

This is a **Minimalist study**. Its tree is `SyntacticObject`
([marcolli-chomsky-berwick-2025], formalized in
`Syntax/Minimalist/Basic.lean`); its structure-building
operation is `merge`; its categories are members of `Cat`. Per-leaf
case stacks are a **derived structural property** of the
`SyntacticObject` — `caseStackAt` walks the tree, treating left-Merge
as "head + complement" per Pesetsky's Minimalist convention, and
prepends the head's POSCat to the complement's leaves. **No external
state, no side-map**: the case stack at a leaf is a function of the
tree structure plus the leaf's identity.

The genuinely paper-specific apparatus is small:

1. **POSCat** — the {N,D,V,P} restriction of Minimalism's `Cat` to the
   four case-bearing categories. The injection `POSCat.toCat` makes
   the restriction structural rather than parallel.
2. **caseStackAt / surfaceCase** — Pesetsky's FA realized as
   structural recursion over the SO. Each `.node head body` step in
   the tree corresponds to a Merge; if `head.outerCat` is a POSCat
   and the queried leaf is in `body`, the head's category is
   prepended to the leaf's stack. This is FA "version 3 of 6"
   ([pesetsky-2013] eq. (76), book p. 65) made implicit:
   complementation-requirements gating is not modeled (treated as
   always satisfied), and "designated as feature assigner for β" is
   exactly the `POSCat.ofCat? head.outerCat` test (only N/D/V/P heads
   FA).
3. **One-Suffix Rule** (Ch 3) — Russian's spell-out: the outermost
   stratum (head of the stack) is realized; inner strata are deleted.
   Encoded by `surfaceCase = (caseStackAt ...).head?.map ...`.
4. **Primeval Genitive Conjecture** (eq. (6), p. 9) — NGEN
   categorizes a Russian root as a noun in the lexicon, in the spirit
   of [marantz-1997]'s root + categorizer. **Automatic from the
   recursion**: a leaf with `outerCat = .N` carries `[POSCat.N]` in
   its base case, so any noun-categorized LIToken has primeval N
   without explicit initialization. The structural bridge to DM
   `Categorizer.n` is `primevalN_via_dm_categorizer`.

## Two corollaries reshape standard Case theory

1. **Every noun is "born" with NGEN** in the lexicon. The base case
   of `caseStackAt` for an `outerCat = .N` leaf returns `[POSCat.N]`
   without input.

2. **Nominative as Schützean default**. D-Merge assigns DNOM (eq. (87)
   p. 73 — D *does* assign nominative morphology); but DNOM is
   "default" in the sense of Schütze 1997, 2001 (cited p. 73): D's
   assignment survives in subject position because Russian finite T
   does not assign features under FA, so nothing later overwrites it.
   When V intervenes (transitive object under eq. 77 conditions), V
   overwrites with VACC; otherwise DNOM stays. This inverts the
   standard "T assigns NOM" view — Pesetsky writes (p. 72) that he
   has "never needed to assume that nominative morphology is assigned
   to the elements of DP by anything other than D itself."

## What is and isn't modeled

**Modeled:** FA version 3 of 6 (eq. (76) p. 65) with α-cat / β-target
entanglement implicit in the structural recursion; Russian One-Suffix
Rule; Primeval Genitive (with DM Categorizer.n bridge); the four POS
categories as restriction of `Cat`; the basic NOM/ACC/GEN/OBL bridge;
`noDeletionSpellOut` as the limiting "no deletion" case (Lardil
itself has *partial* deletion per Ch 3 §3.2 — modeled here as the
limit, with the actual Lardil pattern deferred); cross-framework
agreement bridge with [caha-2009].

**Out of scope (deferred to follow-on study files or commits):**
- The complete VACC restriction (eq. 77 p. 66 — `[+FEM,+SG] ∨ [+ANIM]
  ∨ [+PRONOMINAL]`) **plus** the realization rules eq. (80) p. 67
  (assignment-vs-realization is a two-layer story); to be added in a
  follow-on commit with a paper-local phi-feature side-map.
- FA versions 4-6: Spell-Out locality (Ch 8 §8.3 eq. (110)/(111)
  p. 87-88) and the Prototype mechanism (Ch 9). The current
  `caseStackAt` realizes onto every leaf of body; this is wrong for
  multi-leaf body under Spell-Out — for the single-leaf cases §6
  models, the difference doesn't arise.
- The Number Mismatch puzzle for paucals (Ch 4) — *dva stola* showing
  SG on the noun but PL on demonstratives/adjectives — and the
  Lebanese Arabic # parallel (Ch 5.3). The structural derivation
  (Quant-to-D with NBR pied-piping, eq. (61) p. 54) is left to a
  follow-on study.
- The full D-headed PP analysis of POBL↔VACC alternations (Ch 7).
- The realistic `[DP D [NP A N]]` Russian DP geometry (eq. (62)
  p. 54) — §6 theorems use the schematic `D + N` direct-merge.
- The complementation-requirements gate (eq. (76a)). The current
  recursion treats every Merge as FA-firing; modeling the gate
  requires either a Bool-tagged `Step` extension or filtering the
  derivation history.

## Connections

- `Syntax/Minimalist/Basic.lean` — the substrate. `Cat`,
  `SyntacticObject`, `LIToken`, `merge` all consumed here. The
  derivation-step infrastructure in
  `Syntax/Minimalist/Derivation.lean` is the natural next
  layer once FA gating is modeled.
- `Morphology/DM/Categorizer.lean` ([harley-2014]) —
  the structural bridge `primevalN_via_dm_categorizer` connects
  `POSCat.N` to DM `Categorizer.n` via `Cat.N`.
- `Case` (Blake) gives the cross-linguistic case inventory; we
  bridge `POSCat → Finset Case` (`POSCat.cases`) so Pesetsky's
  primitives plug into the existing typology.
- `Syntax.Case.Order` provides Caha's `containmentRank`; the
  `pesetsky_caha_compatible_prefix` theorem records the cross-
  framework agreement (Pesetsky's on-Caha-hierarchy image equals
  Caha's full hierarchy).
- `Fragments/Slavic/Russian/Case.lean` lists the Russian 6-case
  inventory.
- *vrač* and Pesetsky's feminizing Ж analysis (Ch 5) are noted; the
  morphological-declension claim itself is owned by
  `Studies/Kramer2020.lean::vrač_morph_masculine`.

    Implementation note: this is an inductive type rather than a
    `Subtype` of `Cat` because pattern matching on a subtype requires
    totality branches for the unreachable Cat constructors — `Cat` has
    25+ constructors of which only 4 are POSCat-relevant. The
    inductive form with `toCat` injection carries the same content
    (the four-way restriction is provable, not just intended) without
    polluting every match with a `_ => unreachable`. -/

    N-stratum case feature.

    This is a categorizing-head property in the spirit of
    [marantz-1997]'s root + categorizer architecture — the
    structural bridge to DM's `Categorizer.n` is recorded in
    `primevalN_via_dm_categorizer` below. In this file, **Primeval
    Genitive is automatic from the recursion**: a leaf with
    `outerCat = .N` returns `[POSCat.N]` from `caseStackAt`'s base
    case without any explicit initialization step.

-- § 5: Russian Numerals — Structural Roles, Not Case Assigners
-- ============================================================================

/-- Three numeral classes in Russian ([pesetsky-2013] Ch 4–6).
    The classes differ in *where they merge* and *whether they raise
    to D*, not in case-assignment behavior — none of them is itself an
    FA case assigner in Pesetsky's framework:

    - **paucal** (`dva`, `tri`, `četyre`): an instance of NBR,
      base-merged directly with a numberless N inside NP (eq. (61),
      p. 54). The GEN morphology on the head noun is the *primeval*
      NGEN, not an assignment from the paucal.
    - **higher** (`pjat'`, `šest'`, …): an instance of QUANT,
      base-merged higher within NP and pied-piping NBR to D.
    - **quant** (`mnogo`, `nemnogo`, `skol'ko`): also QUANT, with the
      raising option absent for the indefinite-quantity exponents.

    Across all three the noun's surface case is GEN, but for a
    *structural* reason: the derivation blocks D from probing the noun
    (Quant-to-D with NBR pied-piping), so the primeval N stratum is
    the only one One-Suffix has to project. The full Quant-to-D

    POS-as-case image, restricted to the cases that have a
    `containmentRank` in Caha's hierarchy
    (NOM⊂ACC⊂GEN⊂DAT⊂LOC⊂...), coincides with the standard
    five-case core. Pesetsky additionally puts INST in `pesetskyCore`
    (via `.P`) — this is the case Caha's hierarchy doesn't rank
    (compare `Syntax/Case/Order.lean`'s docstring listing
    "ERG, ABS, INST, COM" as off-hierarchy).

    A non-trivial *agreement* — not refutation. The two frameworks
    identify the same five-case core, with Pesetsky adding INST
    outside the Caha hierarchy. -/
