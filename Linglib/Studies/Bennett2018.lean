# Bennett 2018: recursive prosodic words in Kaqchikel

This file formalizes Bennett's argument that the prosodic word recurses in Kaqchikel.
Prefixes fall into two prosodic classes: low-attaching prefixes are parsed into their stem's
prosodic word, `[ω Pref Stem]`, and high-attaching prefixes outside it, `[ω Pref [ω Stem]]`.
Two diagnostics converge on the split — an onsetless syllable at the left edge of an ω
receives epenthetic [ʔ], so a vowel-initial stem keeps its glottal stop after a high prefix
but loses it after a low one, and the OCP that fuses adjacent identical consonants is inert
across an ω boundary, so degemination applies across a low-prefix juncture but not a high
one. Stacked high prefixes each receive their own glottal stop, which a non-recursive
prosodic hierarchy could only reproduce by positing one new prosodic category per prefix.
The recursion follows from a lexical subcategorization frame on the high prefixes, ranked
above the constraint that every prosodic word correspond to a morphological word.

## Main definitions

* `flat`, `nested`: the two parses of a prefix sequence over a stem.
* `omegaInitial`, `OmegaSeparates`: the structural side of the two diagnostics — the
  ω-initial leaves, and whether an ω boundary separates two leaves.
* `matchWord`, `matchOmega`, `subCat`: `Match (X⁰, ω)`, `Match (ω, X⁰)`, and the
  subcategorization frame, as constraints on prosodic trees.

## Main results

* `omegaInitial_nested`, `omegaInitial_flat`: every stacked high prefix is ω-initial in the
  recursive parse; only the first prefix is in the flat parse.
* `high_prefix_recursive`, `low_prefix_flat`: under `SubCat ≫ Match (ω, X⁰)` a
  high-attaching prefix is parsed recursively and a low-attaching one flat.

/-! ### Parses -/

/-- The flat parse `[ω Pref₁ … Prefₙ Stem]`, the structure of low-attaching prefixes (4a). -/
def flat (prefs : List Constituent) (stem : Constituent) : Tree :=
  .om ((prefs ++ [stem]).map RoseTree.leaf)

/-- The recursive parse `[ω Pref₁ [ω … [ω Prefₙ [ω Stem]]]]`, one ω per high-attaching
prefix ((19a), (23)). -/
def nested : List Constituent → Constituent → Tree
  | [], stem => .om [.leaf stem]
  | p :: ps, stem => .om [.leaf p, nested ps stem]

/-- A light prefix syllable. -/
def pref : Constituent := .syl 1

/-- A heavy stem syllable. -/
def stem : Constituent := .syl 2

/-- Each high-attaching prefix as an independent ω under a higher category (25a), the
carrier's φ standing in for a Clitic Group. -/
def phrasal : Tree := .ph [.om [.leaf pref], .om [.leaf stem]]

/-! ### Diagnostics -/

/-- The leftmost leaf of a tree. -/
def leftmost (t : Tree) : Constituent := t.leafList.head t.leafList_ne_nil

/-- The ω-initial leaves, one per ω node: the left edge of an ω is where an onsetless
syllable receives epenthetic [ʔ], the ω being the domain of syllabification. -/
def omegaInitial (t : Tree) : List Constituent :=
  (t.subtrees.filter (·.value.isOm)).map leftmost

/-- Some ω dominates the leaf `b` but not the leaf `a`: an ω boundary between them, across
which `OCP(X)ω` (18) is inert. -/
def OmegaSeparates (a b : Constituent) (t : Tree) : Prop :=
  ∃ s ∈ t.subtrees, s.value.isOm = true ∧ b ∈ s.leafList ∧ a ∉ s.leafList

instance (a b : Constituent) (t : Tree) : Decidable (OmegaSeparates a b t) :=
  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (∃ _ ∈ _, _))

/-- In the recursive parse every stacked prefix and the stem is ω-initial: `n` high prefixes
over a vowel-initial stem give `n + 1` loci of [ʔ]-insertion ((21)–(23)). -/
theorem omegaInitial_nested {ps : List Constituent} {s : Constituent}
    (hps : ∀ p ∈ ps, p.isOm = false) (hs : s.isOm = false) :
    omegaInitial (nested ps s) = ps ++ [s] := by
  have hom (h : Bool) : (Constituent.om h).isOm = true := rfl

-- (22)–(23): three high prefixes and a vowel-initial root, four glottal stops.
example : omegaInitial (nested [pref, pref, pref] stem) = [pref, pref, pref, stem] := by decide

-- (15) vs (16)–(17): no ω boundary separates a low prefix from its stem, so `OCP(X)ω`
-- degeminates across the juncture; an ω boundary separates a high prefix from its stem.
example : ¬ OmegaSeparates pref stem (flat [pref] stem) := by decide
example : OmegaSeparates pref stem (nested [pref] stem) := by decide

/-! ### Constraints and the ranking -/

/-- `Match (X⁰, ω)` (13) for a single morphological word: a violation unless one ω dominates
all of its segments, i.e. unless the root is an ω. Undominated in Kaqchikel. -/
def matchWord : Constraint Tree := fun t => if t.value.isOm then 0 else 1

/-- `Match (ω, X⁰)` for a single morphological word: every ω other than a root ω fails to
correspond to a morphological word. -/
def matchOmega : Constraint Tree := fun t =>
  t.values.countP (·.isOm) - if t.value.isOm then 1 else 0

/-- Whether the leaf `p` is the left sister of an ω inside an ω: the subcategorization frame
`[ω p [ω ]]` (30) is realised. -/
def hasFrame (p : Constituent) (t : Tree) : Bool :=
  t.subtrees.any fun s ↦ s.value.isOm && match s.children with
    | [.node q [], .node b _] => q == p && b.isOm
    | _ => false

/-- `SubCat`: one violation per high-attaching prefix whose frame (30) is not realised. -/
def subCat (prefs : List Constituent) : Constraint Tree := fun t =>
  (prefs.filter fun p => !hasFrame p t).length

/-- A high-attaching prefix is parsed recursively: under `SubCat ≫ Match (ω, X⁰)`, with
`Match (X⁰, ω)` undominated, the recursive parse is the unique optimum. -/
theorem high_prefix_recursive :
    (Tableau.ofRanking [nested [pref] stem, flat [pref] stem, phrasal]
      [matchWord, subCat [pref], matchOmega]).optimal = {nested [pref] stem} := by
  decide

/-- A low-attaching prefix, carrying no frame, is parsed flat: `Match (ω, X⁰)` alone rules
out the extra ω. -/
theorem low_prefix_flat :
    (Tableau.ofRanking [nested [pref] stem, flat [pref] stem, phrasal]
      [matchWord, matchOmega]).optimal = {flat [pref] stem} := by
  decide

-- The recursive optimum is a well-formed prosodic word: ω over ω is admitted by
-- Layeredness; only the violable `Match (ω, X⁰)` penalises it.
example : IsWord (nested [pref] stem) := by decide
