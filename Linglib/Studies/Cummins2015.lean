# Constraints on numerical expressions

Cummins models the choice of a numerically quantified expression as classical Optimality
Theory. Six violable constraints, informativeness, granularity, quantifier simplicity,
numeral salience, numeral priming and quantifier priming, evaluate the candidate expressions
against the speaker's knowledge and the preceding context, and a speaker's total ranking
selects one, so that apparent variation is variation across rankings and contexts. Round
numerals are salient by Jansen and Pollmann's k-ness, a candidate incurring a subset of a
rival's violations is preferred under every ranking, and a hearer who presumes the utterance
optimal infers that an alternative bounding it in this way was not available to the speaker:
*more than n* implicates *not more than m* for any greater *m* at least as salient and at the
same granularity level, unless *n* was primed.

We derive the constraints' violations from the numeral and the context, reproduce the book's
toy and correction tableaux from them and its approximation tableaux from their printed
marks, and prove the bounding implicature and the exact condition for its attenuation under
priming for arbitrary numerals.

## Implementation notes

* Numeral salience uses the book's k-ness with a zero exponent admitted, under which 20 and
  100 are entirely round. The book prints 50 as satisfying salience, though by its
  definition 50 lacks 2-ness, which changes no comparison in its tableaux.
* Quantifier simplicity follows the book's simplifying assumption that a comparative incurs
  no violation and a superlative one; *exactly* and *about* incur one, as its tableaux print.
* Informativeness reads a comparative or superlative against its own bound, the book's bound
  under discussion, and the other forms at their numeral. The informativeness marks of the
  approximation tableaux, which the book says do not follow from its definition, are entered
  as printed, a parenthesized star counting as one, with entire roundness as the criterion
  for the ambiguity mark that fits them.
* The book assigns no numeric granularity levels to cardinals; `granularityLevel` counts
  trailing zeros, and an unset level is met by every numeral, as the book allows.
