# Thomas and Deo (2020): The Interaction of *just* with Modified Scalar Predicates

Thomas and Deo analyse the approximative use of *just* with equatives and comparatives, *just as
tall as* and *just older than*. A degree is interpreted at a level of precision, the open interval
whose radius is the grain; an equative places the subject's degree above the infimum of the
standard's level and a comparative above its supremum. Equatives make stronger claims at finer
grains and comparatives at coarser ones. *Just* asserts the prejacent at the finest grain and
denies it at every coarser grain where it would be stronger, so it adds nothing to an equative
and gives a comparative an upper bound that cannot be cancelled.

## Main definitions

* `ThomasDeo2020.level`: the level of radius `ε` around a degree, (42)–(43).
* `ThomasDeo2020.equative`, `ThomasDeo2020.comparative`: the constructions at a grain, (45) and
  (49).
* `ThomasDeo2020.just`: approximative *just*, (44).

## Main results

* `ThomasDeo2020.isGranularity_level`, `ThomasDeo2020.not_isPartition_range_level`: a level is a
  granularity function, (40), that does not partition the scale.
* `ThomasDeo2020.level_eq_iUnion_cell`: a level is the union of the cells around its degree over
  all alignments of the grain, footnote 9.
* `ThomasDeo2020.equative_mono`, `ThomasDeo2020.comparative_anti`: (47) and (51).
* `ThomasDeo2020.just_equative`: with an equative *just* adds nothing, (48).
* `ThomasDeo2020.just_comparative_iff`, `ThomasDeo2020.just.not_comparative`: *just older than*
  holds at the finest grain and at no coarser one, (24).
* `ThomasDeo2020.just_equative_of_comparative`: *just as tall as, if not taller*, (16).
* `ThomasDeo2020.not_just_comparative_iff`: the two ways of denying *just older*, (31).
* `ThomasDeo2020.just_comparative_Ici_iff`: the negative component is exhaustification over the
  chain of grains, section 5.
* `ThomasDeo2020.not_equative_of_comparative`: the contradiction of (30).

## Implementation notes

Degrees form a linearly ordered additive group. A construction relates the grain, the standard
and the subject's maximal degree, which stands in for the existential over degrees of (45) and
(49); the infimum and supremum of the level are computed as in (46b) and (50b), `isGLB_level` and
`isLUB_level`. The endpoint clauses of (43) are not formalized: they leave the endpoint out of its
own level, against (40a), which the paper says levels satisfy. The finest grain of (44) and the
contextual grains are parameters; how magnitude, permitted error and roundness fix the finest
grain (section 4) and the role of expectations (section 3.4) are not formalized. The examples are
the rows of `Data.Examples.ThomasDeo2020`.
