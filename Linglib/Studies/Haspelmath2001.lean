# Haspelmath (2001): The European linguistic area: Standard Average European

This file formalizes the argument of [haspelmath-2001] that the core European languages form a
linguistic area: a structural feature is a Europeanism when the great majority of the core
languages have it while the geographically adjacent languages, the eastern Indo-European
languages and the majority of the world's languages lack it, §1, and twelve such features are
mapped in §2. `Language` is the sample of Maps 107.1–107.13 and `isogloss` the languages each
map places inside the feature's line, the two gradient features being derived from the figures
the maps print: Bossong's inversion ratios (`experiencerRatio`, Map 107.4) and the percentages
of anticausative pairs (`anticausativePercent`, Map 107.6). `IsEuropeanism` states criteria
(i)–(iii) over the map sample and `WorldMinority` criterion (iv) over the world-wide surveys
the chapter cites.

`clusterScore` is the cluster map of §4, the number of the nine selected features a language
has: `nucleus_eq` derives the Charlemagne nucleus, French and German with all nine;
`eight_eq` and `seven_eq` the next two layers; and `area_eq` the area of at least five
features that stands out from the remaining languages. The criteria hold on the map data with
two exceptions the chapter itself flags, `majorityOfCore_iff`: negative indefinites without
verbal negation and strict subject agreement are not majority features of the core, and
Armenian carries the relative-pronoun strategy on Map 107.2, `easternIELack_iff`.

## Implementation notes

The feature values are read from the maps of the scanned chapter, and the readings are checked
against the layer counts §4 states: the cluster map's isopleths reproduce exactly. "The great
majority" of criterion (i) is read as a majority, and "lack" in (ii) as fewer than half,
relative to the languages a feature's map covers. Map 107.5 places Hungarian inside the
participial-passive line although §2.5 says Hungarian has no passive; the map is followed, as
the cluster count of five for Hungarian requires. Maps 107.4, 107.6 and 107.9 cover different
samples (Bossong's, the 1993 verb-pair survey's and Stassen's), so criteria are evaluated
per map.

## TODO

* §4 says the languages outside the area have at most two of the nine features; on the maps
  Maltese has four and Basque, Finnish and Estonian three, `outside_le_four`.
