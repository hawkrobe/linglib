# Donnellan (1966): Reference and Definite Descriptions

This file formalizes the two uses of a definite description in [donnellan-1966]. Used
attributively, *the φ* denotes at each world whoever uniquely satisfies φ there, the Russellian
iota taken pointwise (`attributive`, `attributive_eq_some_iff`), and as a nominal denotation
its only presupposition is that the iota is defined (`attributiveNominal`,
`attributiveNominal_assertion`). Used referentially, it denotes the individual the speaker has
in mind whatever the world: the constant character (`Character.const`), whose content is rigid.
The two uses come apart in Donnellan's scene of the man with the martini: when the intended
referent fails the description at a world where someone else uniquely satisfies it, the
attributive use denotes that other individual and the referential use the intended one
(`attributive_ne_const_of_misfit`).

## Implementation notes

Whether the referential use is semantic or pragmatic, the dispute with [kripke-1977], is not
decided here: the file gives Donnellan's truth conditions for each use.
