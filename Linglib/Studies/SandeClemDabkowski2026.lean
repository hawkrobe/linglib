# Sande, Clem and Dąbkowski (2026): Discontinuous vowel harmony in Guébie: Cyclic interleaving of syntax and phonology

This file formalizes the account of discontinuous harmony in [sande-clem-dabkowski-2026]. In
Guébie verb focus the particle of a particle verb fronts, yet it agrees in [ATR] with the
clause-final verb across the subject, the auxiliary and the object. The paper derives this from
local harmony followed by movement. The vP is spelled out when C merges, and it then holds the
particle and, exactly when an auxiliary keeps the verb from raising to T, the verb; harmony applies
there, and the particle keeps its value when the remnant VP that contains it fronts, as in
Koopman's analysis of predicate clefts.

Both Spell-outs are computed from the two parameters of the analysis, whether T holds an
auxiliary and whether the remnant VP fronts, and each clause's Minimalist derivation spells out
the same two snapshots. Harmony then coincides with the verb's position in v, and under Fox and
Pesetsky's cyclic linearization, which the paper adopts, nothing that ends up between the fronted
particle and the verb shares in it. The Wolof relative clauses described by Sy and by Martinović
show the same profile, the trigger moving instead of the target.

## Main statements

* `SandeClemDabkowski2026.Clause.harmony_iff_hasAux`: harmony applies exactly when an auxiliary
  keeps the verb in v (44).
* `SandeClemDabkowski2026.Clause.notMem_vP_of_between`: what stands between the particle and the
  verb on the surface was not spelled out with them (41).
* `SandeClemDabkowski2026.Clause.spellouts_eq_phases`: the derivations spell out the vP and CP
  snapshots.
* `SandeClemDabkowski2026.Clause.vPTableau_optimal`: the vP tableau gives the particle the value
  harmony assigns.

## Implementation notes

* The vP Spell-out is the vP's head and complement, the stage before the subject merges; the
  object shifts to the edge of the whole vP, standing for the VP-external position of footnote 7.
  The rows omit the tone numerals.
* The tableau ranks Sande's two constraints, ATRHARM being Agreement by Projection in Hansson's
  sense, and holds the root fixed as root control requires; with the root free the two constraints
  alone would change the root (`optimal_rootFree`).
* The verb adjoins to the head-final v by Internal Merge on the right, which merges it with the
  whole vP rather than forming a complex head.

## TODO

* The verb-doubling orders of plain verb focus, the island and successive-cyclicity diagnostics of
  §3, and the Atchan nasal harmony the paper leaves open.
