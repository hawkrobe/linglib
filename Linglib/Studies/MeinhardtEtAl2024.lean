# Meinhardt, Mai, Baković and McCollum (2024): Weak Determinism and ATR Harmony

This file formalizes the Maasai case of Meinhardt, Mai, Baković and McCollum, who tighten
the weakly deterministic function class of Heinz and Lai by an explicit interaction
condition. Bidirectional iterative ATR harmony in Maasai is attested and weakly
deterministic, an unbounded semiambient pattern in which every target depends on one side
at a time, so its two contradirectional subsequential passes do not interact; Turkana,
identical but for exceptionally dominant retracted suffix vowels, is attested and
non-deterministic, an unbounded circumambient pattern in which some targets depend on both
sides at once. Dominance is an underlying specification of the spreading value on vowels,
carried by roots and suffixes alike. The rightward spreading pass is output-strictly-local
after Chandlee, Eyraud and Heinz, the bidirectional dominant–recessive map is weakly
deterministic through a non-interacting bimachine (`maasai_isNonInteractingBimachineComputable`)
with two-sided unbounded dependence (`maasai_twoSidedUnboundedDependence`) but without
requiring both sides at once (`maasai_not_requiresBothSides`), the boundary the paper draws.
Tutrugbu's conditional blocking, the paper's (3), and unbounded tonal plateauing, its (2), lie on
the other side: each requires both sides, so neither is semiambient (`tutrugbu_not_semiambient`)
or computed by a non-interacting bimachine. Plateauing is nonetheless weakly deterministic in
Heinz and Lai's sense, by the phonotactic code of §5.2, so their class is not contained in the
paper's (`exists_isWeaklyDeterministic_not_isNonInteractingBimachineComputable`).

## Implementation notes

The alphabet has four symbols carrying the dominant–recessive distinction; the bidirectional
map is modelled directly, raising a recessive vowel when a dominant one occurs anywhere,
rather than as a two-pass composition, and the opaque low vowel, the re-paired low vowel,
glide effects, and the Turkana half of the paper are not represented.

Weak determinism is rendered by the change-based reading of Def. 5: a non-interacting bimachine
licenses every change by one side alone (`IsNonInteractingBimachineComputable`). Def. 6 read
literally asks the same of unchanged cells, and the Maasai bimachine of Fig. 8 fails it: at a
recessive vowel with `q1` on both sides the output is the vowel itself, and moving either state
alone to `q2` changes it.

/-- A minimal alphabet captures the dominance-vs-recessive distinction that drives Maasai ATR
harmony (p. 1203). Four symbols stand in for the relevant phonological contrasts.

* `recL` — a recessive [-ATR] vowel (e.g., /ɪ/, /ʊ/), surfacing as
  [-ATR] absent harmony and raising to [+ATR] under spread.
* `recH` — a recessive vowel surfacing [+ATR] (e.g., /i/, /u/), the
  raised form of `recL`, and transparent to further spread.
* `dom` — a dominant vowel, underlyingly specified [+ATR] and the trigger
  of spreading (the paper's load-bearing distinction).
* `a` — the opaque /a/. Blocks spread.

Consonants are omitted as they are transparent to the harmony. -/

/-- **OSL rule encoding rightward [+ATR] spreading from a dominant root.**

With k = 2 the output decision at each position depends on the
**single immediately preceding output symbol**, as in the canonical OSL fragment of
phonological maps of Chandlee, Eyraud and Heinz. The rule emits as follows.

* Current input is `dom` → emit `recH` (dominant always surfaces as
  [+ATR]).
* Current input is `a` → emit `a` (opaque, blocks spread; the next
  position's output context will be `a`, not a +ATR vowel).
* Current input is `recH` → emit `recH` (already +ATR, passes through).
* Current input is `recL` and previous output was `recH` → emit `recH`
  (spread continues).
* Current input is `recL` otherwise → emit `recL` (no spread to here).

Single-direction iterative spreading patterns are OSL but not ISL, after Chandlee, Eyraud and
Heinz, because the output decision depends on the
*output* history (how far spread has propagated) rather than the *input*
history alone (`rightwardATR_osl_not_isLeftInputStrictlyLocal`). -/

/-! ### Bidirectional Maasai harmony — weakly deterministic (faithful)

Maasai dominant-recessive ATR harmony spreads [+ATR] from a dominant root to recessive
vowels on *both* sides. Modelled here in its non-opaque core: a recessive `recL` raises
to `recH` iff the word contains a dominant vowel anywhere (`maasai`). This is a *union*
of two independent spreading passes, so it is **weakly deterministic**
(the paper's unbounded *semiambient*): the bimachine `maasaiBM`
tracks a dominant seen on each side and its output is literally a `unite` of one-sided
rules. A recessive's surface ATR still co-varies with information unboundedly far on
either side, so `maasai` satisfies `TwoSidedUnboundedDependence` — as does Tutrugbu. The
contrast is exactly the WD/ND boundary the paper draws: only Tutrugbu is *circumambient*,
needing both sides at once (`RequiresBothSides`), which Maasai never does. -/
