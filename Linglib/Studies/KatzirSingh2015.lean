# Katzir and Singh (2015): Economy of Structure and Information

Katzir and Singh account for the oddness of assertions such as *Some Italians come from a warm
country* and *John has one wife* with two felicity conditions. The question condition (8) asks
that an assertion address a question the participants are known to want settled; the answer
condition (15) asks that it be a true, relevant answer not needlessly worse than another true
relevant one, an alternative being better (16) when it is at most as complex, in Katzir's
structural sense, and at least as strong. A `Scenario` collects the meanings and complexities of
the alternatives, the context and the question, and `Felicitous` conjoins the two conditions.

## Main results

* `Scenario.better_trans`: being better is a strict order.
* `Scenario.not_goodAnswer_of_stronger`: a true relevant alternative of no greater complexity
  that is strictly stronger makes an answer needlessly weak, behind the *some*/*all* cases (17)
  and (18) and Heim's Maximize Presupposition (21).
* `Scenario.not_goodAnswer_disj`, `Scenario.not_goodAnswer_conj`: disjoining a stronger or
  conjoining a weaker constituent makes an answer needlessly complex, Hurford's constraint (22).
* `some_all_odd_of_settled`, `all_felicitous_some_odd`, `some_felicitous_all_odd`: the
  one-answer question of (1) makes *some* and *all* alike odd, the open question of (17) leaves
  *all* good and *some* odd where all holds, and the downward-entailing (18) reverses the verdict.

## Implementation notes

A question is a family of answers, the alternatives of the assertion when no question is
explicit, and it is settled in a context when its live answers there coincide, the use the
paper makes of the good question of (7); an assertion is relevant when it does not split a cell
of the partition the answers induce (the paper's footnote 8). Complexity enters as a rank, the
structural order not being rebuilt on trees. Meanings are sets of worlds, with presupposition
folded into truth for (21). The embedded cases of Section 4, which the paper leaves open, are
not represented.
