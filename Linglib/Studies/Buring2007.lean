# Büring 2007: cross-polar nomalies

Comparatives pairing a positive adjective with a negative one are anomalous — *John is shorter than
Mary is tall* — and yet *the ladder was shorter than the house was high* is perfectly acceptable.
This file formalizes the account of the contrast. A negative adjective is the degree negation of
its positive counterpart, and a comparative whose degree phrase carries that negation inverts both
intervals it compares, so *shorter than … high* can be read as *less long than … high*. Read that
way it compares two positive extents; read literally it compares a positive extent with a negative
one, which no scale makes true, while the reinterpretation is a subcomparative.

The reinterpretation needs the negation and the comparative morpheme in one clause, and it is
preempted where the than-clause adjective is the matrix one modulo the negation, since comparative
deletion then supplies a synonymous competitor. Those two conditions cut the cross-polar space into
the paper's three cases, and they block for different reasons: the anomaly has the reinterpretation
available and loses to its competitor, the inverse nomaly has no competitor and still fails.

A modal in the than-clause separates this account from the variant that puts the degree negation
with the than-clause adjective. The negation outside the modal and the negation inside it turn the
same comparison into the box and the diamond of one proposition, so the first is the stronger
reading under a universal modal and the weaker one under an existential; they coincide only when
the accessible worlds agree on the standard's degree.

## Main definitions

* `compareWith` — the comparative morpheme, relative to the modifier in its degree phrase
* `Comparative`, `Comparative.Acceptable` — a cross-polar comparative and the conditions on it
* `negationOutside`, `negationInside` — the two analyses of a modal than-clause

## Main results

* `compareWith_little` — the degree negation inverts both intervals compared
* `not_crossPolar`, `not_crossPolar'` — neither order of a literal cross-polar comparison is true
* `metamorphosis_iff_subcomparative` — the reinterpretation is a subcomparative
* `nomaly_acceptable`, `blocked_for_different_reasons` — the three-way pattern and its two sources
* `reading_of_deletion` — the deletion competitor is synonymous exactly on one dimension
* `negationOutside_box`, `negationInside_box` — the two analyses as box and diamond
* `outside_entails_inside_box`, `inside_not_entails_outside` — the entailment is strict
* `analyses_agree_of_uniform` — a degree-uniform modal base hides the difference

positive extents, and the comparison is the subcomparative of [schwarzschild-wilkinson-2002] — the
ladder's length against the house's height. -/
