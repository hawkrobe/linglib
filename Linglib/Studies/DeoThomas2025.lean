# Deo and Thomas (2025): Addressing the widest answerable question

Deo and Thomas analyse English *just* as a domain-widening strategy. Besides the uses it shares
with *only*, *just* has emphatic, precisifying, minimal-sufficiency, unexplanatory, unelaboratory
and counterexpectational uses, in some of which its prejacent answers no standard construal of the
current question. The account replaces the current question by an underspecified question, the
set of a question's construals at a context, and compares construals by width, which is weaker
than question entailment. *Just* presupposes that the current question is the widest construal
that the speaker can answer truthfully and relevantly, and asserts its prejacent.

## Main definitions

* `DeoThomas2025.WiderThan`: the width order on construals, (32).
* `DeoThomas2025.Context.IsOptimal`: the widest answerable construal, (35).
* `DeoThomas2025.just`: the lexical entry, (36).

## Main results

* `DeoThomas2025.Context.IsOptimal.widest_or_quality_or_relevance`: the three kinds of context in
  which a construal is optimal, (37).
* `DeoThomas2025.Context.isOptimal_ofSet_iff`: the unexplanatory and unelaboratory uses, §4.4
  and §4.5.
* `DeoThomas2025.widerThan_fromSetoid`: a finer partition is a wider construal, §4.2 and §4.7.
* `DeoThomas2025.widerThan_grain`, `DeoThomas2025.figure1`: a finer grain is wider without
  refining the coarser one, so width is not entailment, Figure 1 and fn. 20.
* `DeoThomas2025.widerThan_zone`: extreme adjectives, Figure 2 of §4.8.
* `DeoThomas2025.widerThan_mentionAll`: mention-all is wider than mention-some, §4.1.

## Implementation notes

A construal is a `Question`, whose alternatives `Question.alt` are the maximal resolving
states, so (30a) holds by construction and (30b) is `Question.info`. The context of (31)
carries the common ground, the construals, and the speaker's Quality and Relevance verdicts
as primitives, with the paper's requirements that every construal cover the common ground
and that any two construals be comparable by width, which is what makes the optimal construal
unique. Partition construals are `Question.fromSetoid`, so refinement is the order on
`Setoid`. Grains are `Degree.grain`, whose cells are centred on the multiples of
the width, so that a measure phrase denotes the cell it lies at the centre of, (24); Figure 1's
year and half-year grains are `grain 1` and `grain (1 / 2)` on `ℝ`. Worlds for the constituent
question of §4.1 are the extensions of its predicate. The exhaustive interpretation of the
prejacent is a mandatory implicature that the paper leaves to Gricean reasoning, §4.1 and §4.9,
and is not formalized; neither are the interpretation of the prejacent relative to the
granularity of the current question in (36), the minimal-sufficiency construal of §4.3, whose
alternatives are fixed by a causal structure, nor the Focus Principle, (21).
