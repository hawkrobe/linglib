# Angelopoulos 2026: on clausal complementation, once more

Greek *oti*- and *pu*-clauses are in near-complementary distribution after verbs, are internal
arguments and derived subjects but never external arguments, and a *pu*-complement forces a
stative matrix verb where adverbial and relative *pu* does not. The analysis reverses selection:
*oti* and *pu* carry an [n]-feature checked by a light noun in their specifier, which must
incorporate into a lexical verbal head — possible from the complement position but not from
Spec,vP, whose nearest host is T, nor after P. The complementizers sort their clauses as content
(*oti*) and situation (*pu*), and the incorporating noun must match, so a verb's sort fixes its
complementizer; situations anchor to the evaluation world, whence *pu*'s factivity. The stativity
restriction is the selectional feature of the aspectual heads introducing internal arguments:
vState takes otiP or puP, vEvent only otiP, and adjunct *pu*, which selects its host rather than
being selected, escapes it. Bare *oti*-clauses are true complements that compose as modifiers,
against the transparent syntax–semantics mapping.

## Main definitions

* `clauseSort`: the sort a complementizer imposes; `selectsClause` the aspectual heads'
  selection (§4.1).
* `Predicted`: a verb–complementizer pairing derived from the verb's sort and Vendler class,
  with the sample verbs' sorts in `lexicon`.
* `licensedIn`: incorporation licensing by clause position (§3.1).
