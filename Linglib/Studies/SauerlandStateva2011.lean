# Sauerland & Stateva (2011): Two Types of Vagueness

Sauerland and Stateva argue from the distribution of approximators that vagueness comes in two
kinds. Scalar vagueness belongs to terms that denote a point on a scale, such as numerals: a
contextual granularity maps the point to an interval around it, after Krifka, and scalar
approximators such as *exactly* and *approximately* reset the granularity to the finest or the
coarsest available one. Epistemic vagueness belongs to terms like *heap*, whose extension varies
across indistinguishable worlds, and epistemic approximators quantify over those worlds. Within
the scalar class, *absolutely*, *completely* and *more or less* take only scale endpoints and
block *exactly* and *approximately* there.

## Main results

* `SauerlandStateva2011.classification_predicts_distribution`: the two-type classification
  reproduces every cited judgment.
* `SauerlandStateva2011.exactly_narrowest`, `SauerlandStateva2011.approximately_widest`: at a
  degree that is a scale point of every available granularity, *exactly* yields the narrowest
  reading and *approximately* the widest, (19).
* `SauerlandStateva2011.second_reset_vacuous`: a second scalar approximator is vacuous, §6.3.5.

## Implementation notes

Granularities are the grains of `Degree.Granularity`, identified by their widths, and the
interval a term denotes is the cell of its degree. Cells are half-open so that they partition
the scale; the chapter writes them closed, (12)–(13). The examples at the end check the
intervals of (13) and the oddity of (20).
