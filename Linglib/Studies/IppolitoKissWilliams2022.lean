# Ippolito, Kiss and Williams (2022): The Discourse Function of Adversative Conjunction

This file formalizes [ippolito-kiss-williams-2022], the account of Italian *ma* and English
*but* introducing a single declarative or interrogative clause. A context (`Context`) fixes the
question under discussion, the speaker's doxastic state, the propositions made salient by
previous moves, and the evidence relation of [buring-gunlogson-2000] and [gunlogson-2008] that
the paper leaves informal. A salient proposition supports an answer to the question under
discussion when it provides evidence for it, (15) (`Context.Supports`); a question uttered by
the speaker supports an answer when some answer to it that the speaker believes provides
evidence for it, (21) (`Context.QSupports`). Two moves agree when they support a common answer
and disagree when each supports an answer but no common one, (16), (17), (22) and (23).
Discourse *ma* requires a salient relevant proposition that does not agree with its argument,
(18) and (24) (`Context.Ma`), and *but* one that disagrees with it, (29) and (34)
(`Context.But`). The table of question types follows: with nothing salient neither particle is
licensed; a question none of whose answers the speaker believes, on the ignorance reading or
with the negative bias, supports nothing, so *ma* is licensed by any salient relevant
proposition and *but* by none; and a negative polar question whose believed answer supports the
opposite answer from the salient proposition disagrees with it and licenses both.

## Implementation notes

* Relevance to the question under discussion, which the paper does not define, is the
  substrate's `Question.IsRelevantTo` to the question under discussion together with the
  subquestions of its strategy, as the sequel [ippolito-kiss-williams-2025] assumes.
* A declarative argument of *ma* or *but* is asserted, so its support is that of the singleton
  question: belief plus evidence (Section 3.2.3).
* The amended notion of support (45), on which the interrogative speech act itself provides
  evidence, is not formalized.
