# Ippolito, Kiss & Williams 2022: Discourse Function of Adversative Conjunction
[ippolito-kiss-williams-2022]

The Sinn und Bedeutung 26 paper that introduces the doxastic-evidential
notions of **SUPPORT**, **AGREEMENT**, and **DISAGREEMENT** which the
follow-up paper [ippolito-kiss-williams-2025] reuses for discourse
*only*. The 2022 paper itself targets adversative *but*; the SUPPORT /
AGREE / DISAGREE apparatus is the part of that account both papers share.

This file currently formalizes only the shared apparatus — the *but*
analysis itself is not yet formalized. The recap below follows the
conceptual statement that [ippolito-kiss-williams-2025] §4 (p. 225)
gives explicitly: *"Following Ippolito et al. (2022) we define the
notion of AGREEMENT (and DISAGREEMENT) and the notion of SUPPORT, on
which the former notion is based."*

## SUPPORT

A sentence `S` supports a proposition `r` (in context `c`) iff some
alternative `q ∈ ⟦S⟧` is doxastically grounded for the speaker
(`dox_sp ⊆ q`) and provides evidence for `r`. The doxastic anchor
is what derives the [ippolito-kiss-williams-2025] §5.2
interrogative-left-argument restriction: a speaker who doesn't believe
any alternative cannot use the sentence to support anything.

**Project-canonical refinement.** The original 2022 statement leaves
"q provides evidence for r" deliberately informal. We formalize it as
`IsPositiveEvidence q r μ` (Bayesian conditional-probability shift,
see `Semantics/Questions/Probabilistic.lean`). This is a
strengthening; the §5.2 architectural derivations carry over but rest
on the strengthened relation. A flavor-agnostic version parameterized
by an abstract evidence relation could be added if a sibling theory
needs it.

## AGREEMENT / DISAGREEMENT

Two sentences agree on a QUD if they support a common alternative; they
disagree if each supports some alternative but no shared one witnesses
agreement. Both relations are symmetric in their `S`/`S'` arguments.
