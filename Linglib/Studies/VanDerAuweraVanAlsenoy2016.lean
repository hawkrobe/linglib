# van der Auwera and Van Alsenoy (2016): On the Typology of Negative Concord

This file formalizes [van-der-auwera-van-alsenoy-2016], a typology of negative concord, a
semantically single negation expressed both by a clausal negator and by a negative indefinite,
(1), over a variety sample of 179 languages. A negative indefinite is an indefinite whose dominant
use is negation, as against a negatively polar or a neutral indefinite, `Indefinite`, and a
language's way of negating with an indefinite is one of Kahrel's five strategies,
`Strategy`. The paper's first claim is that negative concord is not frequent: the impression that
it is rests on [haspelmath-1997]'s deliberately wide notion of negative indefinite, so that the
co-occurrence value of WALS 115A, [haspelmath-2013], covers the neutral and polar strategies as
well as concord, `toWALS`, `toWALS_eq_predicateNegationAlsoPresent_iff`. The second claim is that
strict concord is far more frequent than non-strict, and that non-strict concord is not one
pattern but many. A concord system records, for a negative indefinite before and after the finite
verb, whether the clausal negator is absent, optional or obligatory, or the position unavailable,
`Marking` and `System`, the paper's formulas (19), (26), (28), (30), (32), (36), (38), (39): strict
concord is obligatory marking in both positions, `IsStrict`, and non-strict concord is concord
that is not strict, `IsNonStrict`. [jespersen-1917]'s Negative Early principle, that the clausal
negator appears first where the negative indefinite comes late, orders the two positions,
`NegativeEarly`, and the four subtypes of Table 9 are exactly the non-strict systems with both
positions available that respect it, `nonStrict_negativeEarly_iff`. The diachrony of Table 6 from
Latin to modern Slavic is a chain on the strictness scale, `stages_isChain`, each stage respecting
Negative Early, `negativeEarly_of_mem_stages`, whereas Catalan moves from strict to the Spanish
subtype, the other way along the scale, `informalCatalan_lt_formalCatalan`.

## Implementation notes

The strictness scale orders the markings absent, optional, obligatory, and a system is a pair of
optional markings, the asterisk of the paper's formulas being `none`; Georgian's immediate
precedence, (36), Welsh's compound verbs, (43), and Yiddish's emphatic omission, (45), are
recorded as rows, since they parametrize concord by something other than the position relative
to the finite verb. The frequencies of Tables 1 to 3, the areal distribution, and the
morpho-syntactic composition of Table 4 are reported in the paper and not formalized. The
examples are the rows of `Data.Examples.VanDerAuweraVanAlsenoy2016`.

/-- The indefinite used in a negative clause, by its dominant use: neutral, at home in positive
and negative contexts alike, negatively polar, licensed by negation among other contexts, or
negative, used predominantly for negation. -/
inductive Indefinite where
  | neutral
  | negativelyPolar
  | negative
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- [kahrel-1996]'s strategies for a single negation with an indefinite, Table 1: a verbal negator
with a neutral or a negatively polar indefinite, a negative indefinite alone, negative concord,
and another construction such as a negative existential. -/

/-- The WALS 115A value a strategy falls under: [haspelmath-2013]'s co-occurrence of predicate

frequency of the WALS value does not measure the frequency of concord. -/
