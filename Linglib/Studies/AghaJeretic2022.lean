# Agha and Jeretič (2022): Weak Necessity Modals as Homogeneous Pluralities of Worlds

Weak necessity modals take obligatory apparent wide scope over negation: *you shouldn't go* cannot
be continued by *but you are allowed to go*, where *you don't have to go* can. Agha and Jeretič
propose that *should* is to *must* what *the* is to *all*: strong necessity quantifies universally
over the best worlds, while weak necessity predicates the prejacent of their plurality, which is
neither true nor false when some best worlds satisfy it and some do not. Weak necessity is derived
from strong necessity by an operator picking out the unique minimal set of a quantifier, which
possibility lacks.

## Main results

* `should_eq_indet_iff`, `should_not`: the gap arises exactly in mixed domains, and negation is
  symmetric and hence scopeless.
* `not_exists_of_should_not`, `must_false_of_indet`: a true negated *should* contradicts the
  existential continuation, where a negated *must* does not.
* `must_eq_metaAssert_should`, `necessarily_removes_gap`: *necessarily* removes the gap as *all*
  does.
* `exception_tolerance`, `two_doors`: Križ's usability gives the exception tolerance of the
  perfect-grade scenario and the indeterminacy of the two-doors scenario.
* `x_must`, `possibility_witnesses`: the derivation of weak necessity applies to necessity only.
* `should_matches_grid`, `domainRestriction_fails_exactly_gap`: over the paper's grid of
  judgments the plural semantics fits every cell, and domain restriction fails exactly the gaps.

## Implementation notes

`should D p` is Križ's plural predication with the best worlds `D w` as atoms. The grid reads each
example row as a cell (`Cell.ofDatum`): its polarity, its scenario, and the value judged, the
classical value the polarity fixes where all or no best worlds satisfy the prejacent, and the gap
or the recorded classical value in the mixed scenario. The proportional and degree-based rivals,
and the conditionals, generics and habituals of the closing section, are not formalized.

/-! ### Deriving weak from strong necessity

The quantifiers are families of sets of worlds, and the operator deriving weak necessity picks
out a minimal set in the family. For the universal quantifier `(D ⊆ ·)` that is mathlib's
`minimal_ge_iff`; the existential quantifier needs the lemma below. -/
