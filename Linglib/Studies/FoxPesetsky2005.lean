# Fox and Pesetsky (2005): Cyclic Linearization of Syntactic Structure

This file formalizes [fox-pesetsky-2005]'s account of successive cyclicity and Holmberg's
Generalization under cyclic linearization (`Minimalist.Linearization.Consistent`). The
derivational scenarios (13)–(15) are theorems over arbitrary terminals: movement from the left
edge of a domain converges, movement from a non-edge position crashes on the pair it reorders,
and moving the edge material along restores the order. Swedish Object Shift is these scenarios
with the verb, the object and an intervener as the terminals. The derivations the paper sketches
for its sentences spell out the snapshots it draws (`Sketch.spellouts_eq_phases`), and whether
they linearize predicts the sentences' judgments (`rows_predicted`).

/-- In Scenario 1 (13) leftward movement from the left edge of a domain converges. -/

    Consistent [[X, Y, Z], [X, a, Y, Z]] :=
  consistent_of_forall_sublist (by simp) hnd

/-- In Scenario 2 (14) leftward movement from a non-edge position reorders the moved element and
the edge, and the derivation crashes whatever else it contains. -/
theorem scenario2 : ¬ Consistent [[X, Y, Z], [Y, a, X, Z]] :=
  not_consistent_of_pair X Y ⟨[X, Y, Z], by simp, by simp⟩ ⟨[Y, a, X, Z], by simp, by simp⟩

/-- In Scenario 3 (15) moving the edge material along with the non-edge element preserves their
order, so the derivation converges. -/
theorem scenario3 [DecidableEq α] (hnd : [X, Y, a, Z].Nodup) :
    Consistent [[X, Y, Z], [X, Y, a, Z]] :=
  consistent_of_forall_sublist (by simp) hnd

/-- An ordering cycle through several Spell-outs crashes as well: the crash condition is the
acyclicity of the accumulated order, not a directly contradicted pair. -/
