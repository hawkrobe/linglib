# Itzhaki (2021): Qualitative versus Quantitative Representation: A Non-Standard Analysis of the Sorites Paradox

Itzhaki traces the Sorites paradox to the conflation of two maps from individuals to degrees. A
quantitative map sends a pile to its number of grains and a person to their height, in an
Archimedean scale; a qualitative map sends piles and changes into the hyperreals. A heap gets an
infinite qualitative size, so that adding or removing a grain never crosses between heaps and
non-heaps, and a change of one millimetre gets an infinitesimal qualitative magnitude, so that the
standard part of a height ignores it. The premises of each Sorites are then jointly satisfiable
under the qualitative map and inconsistent under the quantitative one, and the conclusion of the
argument follows from its premises only when the inverse of the size map is total.

A soritical argument is one schema, `Sorites`: a base case, tolerance along a step relation, and
a counterexample. The classic and the reverse paradox of the heap are its instances along steps of
one grain, read through either size map.

## Main statements

* `Itzhaki2021.Sorites.conclusion`, `Itzhaki2021.Sorites.false_of_total`: the conclusion of a
  Sorites follows from its premises when the inverse of the size map is total, and the premises are
  then inconsistent.
* `Itzhaki2021.sorites_not_heap`, `Itzhaki2021.sorites_heap`: under the qualitative size, the
  classic and the reverse paradox of the heap hold for any heap predicate with a heap and a
  non-heap, while under the quantitative size of the model they are inconsistent
  (`Itzhaki2021.Model55.not_sorites_size`).
* `Itzhaki2021.induction_premise`, `Itzhaki2021.conclusion_tall`,
  `Itzhaki2021.not_forall_sub_natCast_ge`: with an infinitesimal unit of change the premises of the
  tall paradox hold, and with the quantitative unit its conclusion fails.
* `Itzhaki2021.instIsTransInfinitelyLess`, `Itzhaki2021.merged_iff`,
  `Itzhaki2021.not_merged_qualSize`: being infinitely less is transitive, and the merged paradox
  of the small heap is satisfiable exactly when the qualitative sizes of its two heaps are
  infinitely apart, which the qualitative size of the heap paradox never makes them.

## Implementation notes

* The finite and the infinitesimal hyperreals are mathlib's subgroups of archimedean classes at
  least and above that of `1`, and the standard part is mathlib's `stdPart`.
* Whether the size of a heap is known is a parameter of the qualitative size; no result depends on
  it.
* The pluralities of the heap model are their sizes, as the paper reduces them (fn. 23), and the
  individuals of the tall model their heights in millimetres.
* As printed, (9d) claims that an infinite number times a nonzero finite one is infinite, which
  `ω * ε = 1` refutes (`not_forall_mk_mul_neg`), and (80) is unsatisfiable under the qualitative
  size (36) (`not_merged_qualSize`).
