# Stojković (2026): Same Form, Different Grammars: The Slavic [ov]~[u] Alternation

This file formalizes Stojković's account of the Slavic verbalizer, the suffix of verbs derived
from nouns and adjectives. The suffix is [u] before the theme /-je-/ and a vowel followed by

@[expose] public section
[v] before the theme /-a-/, where the languages fall into three groups: [ov] throughout, [ov]
alternating with [ev] after a palatal, and [uv] throughout.

Stojković gives the suffix one underlying form in every language, a defective diphthong whose
first base node has no features and whose second is high and back but neither vowel nor
consonant. A candidate leaves that form as it is, deletes the empty node and makes the second a
vowel, or fills the empty node and makes the second [v]. A candidate here is its string of
segments with its correspondence to the input, and every constraint is computed from the two.
One ranking per group then gives [u] before /-je-/ and the group's vowel before /-a-/
(`optimal_eq`), and for every variety of the paper's Tables 1 and 2 exactly one of the three
rankings generates all of its forms (`existsUnique_generates`), the Bulgarian and Macedonian
present in [uv] included, since its theme is /-a-/.

## Main results

* `optimal_eq`: the winner of each group's ranking in each context.
* `image_pattern`: the factorial typology of the variable constraints, the paper's (31).
* `existsUnique_generates`: each variety's forms single out its group.
* `uv_bounds_ov`: over the paper's own constraints [uv] harmonically bounds [ov].

## Implementation notes

The paper states MAX and DEP over the morphemic and phonetic structures of Containment Theory.
They are rendered as the correspondence constraints that count input nodes without a
correspondent and corresponding pairs whose output has a feature value its input lacks. The
candidates are the paper's; a deleted node with [v], which it sets aside, is not among them. A
front vowel shares the [−back] of a palatal and so is a candidate only after one.

## TODO

The paper's tableaux never penalize the epenthesis of [+high], so that over its constraints
[uv] does at least as well as [ov] everywhere and better on DEP[−high] (`uv_bounds_ov`), and
its typology (31) cannot be derived from them (`image_pattern_of_paperFamilies`). The paper
attributes the [o] of the first two groups to the markedness of [+high]; that preference is
made a constraint here, DEP[+high], ranked where each group needs it. The paper's tableau (28)
also marks [iv] for DEP[+back], which its representation of [iv] with a shared [−back] does not
support and which changes no outcome.
