# Keine (2020): Probes and Their Horizons

This file formalizes the horizons theory of [keine-2020] as it parameterizes probes across
languages. A probe's search terminates at its horizon category ((33)); labels are bilateral within
an extended projection, so a clause is opaque to a probe exactly when its label contains the
horizon, and Upward Entailment holds for every probe, transparency being antitone in the
extension order of clause sizes (`sizes_le`). Hindi's four clause
sizes ((168)) follow from the probes of (219), with NmlzP and CP incomparable, the one transparent
to wh-licensing and the other to Ā-movement (`hindi_table`, `nmlzP_cP_incomparable`), and the
A-Movement–Agreement Generalization ((231)) from the two probes on T⁰ sharing a horizon. English
((241)) and German ((367)), with ForceP above CP, follow the same way (`english_table`,
`german_table`), and the Itelmen ((269)) and Tsez ((271)) probes mismatch movement and
agreement in both directions (`mismatches`). Vacuity ((274)–(278)) yields the Height–Locality
Theorem ((279)), which the attested probes obey, and the default horizon ((307)) is the strictest
nonvacuous one (`hlt_location_to_horizon`, `default_horizon_strictest`). Variation is a horizon
parameter: the A-movement settings of (300) form an entailment chain (`a_movement_chain`), and
the Ban on Improper Movement (Section 6.2) with the smuggling and remnant-movement restrictions
(Section 3.4.3) is the opacity of a CP to the A-probes whose horizon it inherits
(`improper_movement`).

## Implementation notes

Labels are the bilateral labels of the substrate's `ClauseSpine`s, with the Hindi NmlzP, the
German ForceP and the Tsez TopP and ForceP defined here, and so are the probes of (219), (241),
(300) and (367); the Itelmen and Tsez probes are parameterized by their head, which (269) and
(271) leave open. Chapters 4 and 5, on CP and vP phases, are not formalized beyond the opacity
facts the tables record.
