# Kalin et al. (2026): The Morphology/Syntax Interface

This file formalizes [kalin-bjorkman-etal-2026], the Element's map of the morphology/syntax
interface. Section 2 sets out the dimensions along which theories vary: whether the morphology
is a component separate from the syntax, lexicalism; the timing of the two computations, an
architecture that is parallel or pre-syntactic exactly in the lexicalist theories and syntactic
or post-syntactic in the non-lexicalist ones, (4); whether complex forms arise from pieces or
from processes, which implicates lexicalism; and whether exponents are independent of the
features they realize, realizational, or built up with them, incremental. Table 2 places seven
theories in the space of lexicalism, mapping and exponence, and its two empty cells are exactly
the non-lexicalist process-based ones (`unattested_iff`), the four representative theories'
architectures agreeing with their lexicalism (`architecture_lexicalism`). Section 3 separates
the morphosyntactic word, diagnosed by cohesiveness, fixed order, selectivity and domainhood,
from the phonological word, and crosses the two kinds of boundness into Table 3's cells
(`WordhoodProfile.classify`, `rows_cells`); [zwicky-pullum-1983]'s diagnostics place the English
plural affix in the canonical-affix cell and the auxiliary clitic in the simple-clitic cell
(`plural_s_canonicalAffix`). Section 4 distinguishes seven form-meaning mappings and Table 4
records how each representative theory treats each; the theories that treat some non-one-to-one
mapping as genuine are exactly the realizational ones (`handlesNatively_iff_realizational`), the
purely syntactic Morphology as Syntax reanalyses every one (`mas_reanalyses`), and no theory
treats morphological gaps natively (`no_theory_handles_gaps`).

## Implementation notes

* Table 4 is the Element's own classification of the theories, carried as data; the theorems
  over it are the Element's readings of the table, and the cross-table theorem relates it to
  Table 2.
* The p-boundness of an element is not derived; the wordhood rows carry both boundnesses and
  the cell, and only the morphosyntactic side of the English affix and clitic is read off
  [zwicky-pullum-1983]'s profiles.
