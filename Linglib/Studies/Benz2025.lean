# Benz (2025): Structure and interpretation across categories

Three case studies on the syntax–LF interface in German run on the contextual-allosemy
substrate of `DistributedMorphology.Allosemy` ([benz-2025]). One nominalization structure
yields the event, referential and content readings of *Beobachtung*, the variation lying in
the allosemes of v and n (Ch. 3, after [wood-2023]). The co-occurrence restrictions among
inseparable prefixes, separable particles and resultative secondary predicates follow from a
phrase-structural factor, that the inner element be a head, together with an event-structural
one, [tenny-1994]'s Single Delimiting Constraint (Ch. 4), and the particle "structure
problem" of [luedeling-2001] is solved differently by the three nominalization types, whose
distribution of preverbal elements follows from their solutions, while *-ung* further demands
the complex change-of-state structure of [rossdeutscher-kamp-2010] (Ch. 5).

## Implementation notes

Alloseme selection is the substrate's own engine: allosemes are Vocabulary Items over
neighborhoods, applicability is the Subset Principle, and the canonical choice is Elsewhere
competition. The readings are derived from typed denotations, and the co-occurrence and
nominalization paradigms are predicted cell by cell against the example rows, the Table 3
combinations, the resultative data of [creemers-2020] and the *-ung* and *Ge-…-e* forms of
Ch. 5, with the base verbs read from the German fragment.

/-! ### Typed alloseme denotations (Ch. 3)

The denotations of the deverbal allosemes, after [wood-2023] as taken over
in Ch. 3: nominalization semantics runs over a domain in which eventualities
are entities, and each n alloseme builds an entity predicate from what v
hands it. The reading typology is then derived, not tabulated: readings exist
exactly where the composition is defined
(`readingFromAllosemes_isSome_iff_denote`), and the analytical options for
the result and content readings compose to identical entity predicates
(`result_options_pred_agree`, `content_options_agree`). -/

variable {E S : Type*}

/-- A model for nominalization denotations: eventualities embed into the
entity domain (a nominal can describe an event as an entity), split into
stative and dynamic, with `result` relating an entity to the eventuality
that produced it and `hasContent` picking out the entities with
propositional content. -/
structure NominalizationModel (E S : Type*) where
  /-- Eventualities as entities. -/
  ev : S → E
  ev_injective : Function.Injective ev
  /-- Stative eventualities. -/
  stative : S → Prop
  /-- The entity is the result of the eventuality. -/
  result : E → S → Prop
  /-- The entity has propositional content (*rumor*, *idea*, *claim*). -/
  hasContent : E → Prop

/-- A root's contribution to nominalization semantics: what it says of
entities and of eventualities, and its Theme relation — which entity an
eventuality of the root's kind is predicated of. -/
structure RootMeaning (E S : Type*) where
  onEntities : E → Prop
  onEvents : S → Prop
  theme : E → S → Prop

/-- What v hands to n: under the eventive alloseme, verbal event content
together with the Theme position v introduces (§2.2); under the zero
alloseme, the untouched root — and no argument position, since none is
introduced by v (§3.5). -/
inductive VerbalDenotation (E S : Type*) where
  | eventive (p : S → Prop) (theme : E → S → Prop)
  | zero (ρ : RootMeaning E S)

/-- The v alloseme applied to the root. -/
def denoteV (ρ : RootMeaning E S) : Verbalizer.Alloseme → VerbalDenotation E S
  | .eventive => .eventive ρ.onEvents ρ.theme
  | .zero     => .zero ρ

/-- A nominal denotation: the entity predicate, together with the
internal-argument relation when the nominal retains one. The relation is
present exactly when v introduced the Theme position — no such position
is part of the denotation unless v contributes it (§2.2, §3.5). -/

/-- The n alloseme applied to v's output, `none` where the combination
is uninterpretable. The CEN describes the events the verb describes and
retains the Theme position v introduced; the SEN predicates the root's
entity content of an event-entity; the result alloseme picks out what an
event of the root's kind produced ([wood-2023]'s denotation); the content
alloseme ignores the verbal layer entirely. The non-deverbal allosemes
have their semantics in `Semantics/Possession/Relationalizer.lean`. -/

/-- The event and result readings are mirror images at the
entity-predicate level: the two analytical options for the result

option the result nominal retains the internal-argument position v
introduced, on the v-vacuous option it has none. Since result nominals
