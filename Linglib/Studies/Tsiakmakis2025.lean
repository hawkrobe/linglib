# Tsiakmakis (2025): On the Non-Homogeneity of Expletive Negation in Greek and Beyond

This file formalizes the two kinds of expletive negation of [tsiakmakis-2025]. Greek has two
sentential negators in complementary distribution by mood: indicative *dhen*, standard
negation, (7), `neg1`, and non-veridical *min*, (13), a modal negation, `neg2`, true when the
negated proposition holds throughout the best worlds of a [kratzer-1981] ordering source.
Both have non-negative uses, (20): *dhen* in negative exclamatives, rhetorical questions and
preposed negation questions, *min* in fear complements, conditionals and polar questions.
Expletive *dhen* is *dhen*, (37): its negation is masked by rhetoricity or by the speaker's
bias at the level of the utterance. Expletive *min* keeps the modal component and drops the
negation, (58): a biased epistemic modal, `neg2Expl`. The diagnostics follow from the
semantics. Canonical *dhen* under expletive *min* yields negative *min*, (39), (47), (53),
`neg2Expl_neg1`, whereas *dhen* under *dhen* cancels, `neg1_neg1`; expletive *min* conveys
positive bias, every best world being a p-world, so it excludes the ignorance of a *min*-free
question, in which both alternatives are possible, (55), `not_ignorant_of_mem_neg2Expl`, and
it is consistent with negative *min* only when no world is best,
`bestWorlds_eq_empty_of_mem_neg2Expl_of_mem_neg2`. The survey of section 5 sorts the host
inventory into apparent hosts, featuring NEG₁ under a masking factor, `ApparentHost` and
`ApparentHost.masking`, and hosts proper, featuring NEG₂ as the spell-out of an epistemic or
deontic ordering source, `ProperHost`, the revised inventory (95), `Host`.

## Implementation notes

Propositions are sets of worlds and NEG₂ is the substrate's `Modality.Kratzer.necessity`, the
best worlds of a modal base and an ordering source; the two negators of the Greek fragment are
the markers, their semantics being the paper's. The flavour of the ordering source varies by
host and language, epistemic for Greek *min*, deontic for French fear-predicate *ne*, and is
not fixed here. The NCI-licensing and left-periphery diagnostics, (40) and (44), are syntactic
and recorded by the rows, as are the arguments that negative exclamatives are rhetorical
questions, (23)–(24), that preposed and non-preposed negation questions collapse, (32)–(35),
and that conditionals and free relatives are tentative hosts. The examples are the rows of
`Data.Examples.Tsiakmakis2025`.
