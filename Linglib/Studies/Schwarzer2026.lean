# Schwarzer 2026: the law and order of selection-violating coordination

Schwarzer tests three analyses of a clause coordinated with a noun phrase where only the noun
phrase is selected on German, where complements follow the verb in a root clause and precede it in
an embedded one. The bottom-up analyses (Sag, Gazdar, Wasow and Weisler; Munn) make the first
conjunct prominent, so they check `List.take 1`; the linear closeness analysis (Bruening and Al
Khalaf; Bruening) and the temporal one (Kim and Lu) check the conjunct next to the verb,
`checkedOnce`. They part company before the verb, where only the bottom-up analyses admit the noun
phrase first. Experiment 1 shows that German allows the construction, and in Experiment 2 the noun
phrase first is preferred before the verb as much as after it, against both closeness analyses.

## Main results

* `exp1_predictions`, `exp1_rows`: the grammar admits every condition of Experiment 1 but a bare
  clause after a verb whose fragment entry takes none, and decides the paper's samples.
* `accounts_diverge_embedded`: the analyses differ before the verb and agree after it.
* `choices_refute_closeness`, `choices_match_structural`: the order preferred before the verb is
  one the closeness analyses exclude and the bottom-up ones admit.

## Implementation notes

* The verbs' c-selection is read off their entries in `Fragments/German/Verbs`. The results are
  `Data/Experiments/Schwarzer2026`; the mixed model and the logistic regression are not
  formalized, and the preferred order is the one chosen more often.
* The bottom-up analyses are given the noun-phrase shell over the clause of the 2020 study; their
  variant that licenses only the first conjunct makes the same predictions here.

configuration of (16). -/

entry, which has a noun phrase if a frame takes one and a clause if a frame takes a
*dass*-clause. -/

selecting one (p. 7). -/

clause or a coordination with the noun phrase first. -/

/-- The grammar admits every condition of Experiment 1, after the verb, except a bare clause after
a verb that does not select one, where the coordination is admitted through the null N. All the
analyses agree, since the verb precedes. Coordinations are accordingly rated above bare clauses
after those verbs, and lose less from the absence of selection (table (14), p. 9). -/

theorem preferred_eq (p : Position) : preferred p = .dpFirst := by

preferred before the verb is one they exclude. -/
