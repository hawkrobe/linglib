# Landau (2013): Control in Generative Grammar: A Research Companion

This file formalizes the signature of obligatory control of [landau-2013]: the controller must
be a co-dependent of the clause, and the controlled element, or part of it, is interpreted as a
bound variable. The familiar criteria follow from the two clauses: co-dependence excludes
arbitrary, long-distance, and non-c-commanding control and forces the sloppy reading under
ellipsis, and variable binding excludes the strict reading under *only*. The `Control.Excludes`
instance records this derivation, so that the library's `Control.admits` returns the book's
characterizations: a profile satisfying both clauses admits no criterial configuration and one
satisfying neither admits them all. `ofNoncoreferential` reads such a profile off whether a
clause type licenses a noncoreferential subject — a free reading of the controlled position,
refuting co-dependence — which the studies of overt controlled subjects consume.

## Implementation notes

The signature is the book's (74), in the section on the obligatory-control signature of the
first chapter, and the derivation of the criteria from it runs through (75)–(79). Obligatory
*de se* is not
criterial for obligatory control, being a property of the attitude tier, and the lexical-subject
diagnostic is a criterion of obligatory nullness rather than of obligatory control, the
separation the overt-subject studies turn on; the positive human-reference clause of the
non-obligatory signature is not modelled.
