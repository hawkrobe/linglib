# Zwicky and Pullum (1983): Cliticization vs. Inflection: English n't

This file formalizes [zwicky-pullum-1983]'s six criteria for telling clitics from
inflectional affixes and their application to the English contracted negator *-n't*. Clitics
show a low degree of selection with respect to their hosts, no arbitrary gaps, no
morphophonological or semantic idiosyncrasies, are not affected by syntactic rules, and can
attach to material already containing clitics; affixes show the opposite on each count
(criteria A–F). A morpheme's profile on the six criteria (`CliticAffixProfile`) determines its
status (`CliticAffixProfile.classify`): the English contracted auxiliaries *'s*, *'ve* and *'d*
are clitic-like on every criterion and classify as simple clitics, the affixes *-ed*, *-s* and
*-est* are affix-like on every criterion, and *-n't*, taken almost without exception to be a
clitic, is affix-like on every criterion and classifies as an inflectional affix (`nt_is_affix`).
Two of the criteria are checked against the fragment of English auxiliaries: the paradigm gaps
*mayn't* and *amn't* of criterion B (`may_gap`, `am_gap`) and the irregular forms *won't*,
*can't*, *shan't*, *don't* and *mustn't* of criterion C (`irregularNegatives`). The semantic
idiosyncrasy of criterion D, that *can't* means `NOT(CAN(P))` while *mustn't* means
`MUST(NOT(P))`, is recorded as opposite scope patterns (`scope_idiosyncrasy`), and the two
scopings are separated on a Kripke model (`neg_over_poss_ne_poss_over_neg`,
`neg_over_nec_ne_nec_over_neg`).

## Implementation notes

* The classification takes the paper's two unanimous poles as decisive: six affix-like answers
  make an inflectional affix, six clitic-like answers a simple clitic. The paper defines special
  clitics distributionally, not as an intermediate score; the middle branch is a default.
* The criteria of a profile are Boolean data read off the paper's discussion; only the two
  fragment-checked criteria are derived.
