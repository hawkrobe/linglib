formalized as a diagnostic profile. The classification (clitic vs. affix)
is *derived* from the profile, not stipulated. ZP's surprising result:
English *-n't* scores affix-like on all six.

# [zwicky-pullum-1983]: Cliticization vs. Inflection
[zwicky-pullum-1983]

Empirical data and classification theorems for the argument that
English contracted negator *-n't* is an inflectional affix, not a
simple clitic.

## Core argument

Six diagnostics (A–F) separate clitics from inflectional affixes.
English simple clitics (*'s*, *'ve*, *'d*) score clitic-like on all six.
English inflectional affixes (*-ed*, *-s*, *-est*) score affix-like on all six.
The contracted negator *-n't* scores **affix-like on all six** — a surprising
result given the near-universal prior assumption that it is a clitic.

## Semantic scope bridge (criterion D)

The scope irregularity of negation with modals provides a bridge to
`Semantics.Modality`: *can't* means NOT(CAN(P)) but *mustn't*
means MUST(NOT(P)). This non-compositional scope behavior is characteristic
of inflectional affixes, not clitics.

- E. SAI applies to *-n't* forms: *Isn't he?*, *Can't you?*, *Haven't
     they?*. Contracted negator moves with auxiliary under T-to-C.

-- ============================================================================
-- §5: Semantic Scope Bridge (Criterion D)
-- ============================================================================

/-! ### Scope of negation with contracted modals

Z&P observe that *can't* and *mustn't* show opposite scope relations:

- *You can't go home* = NOT(CAN(P)): negation scopes over possibility
- *You mustn't go home* = MUST(NOT(P)): necessity scopes over negation

This is an irregularity in the connection between the contracted form
and its uncontracted paraphrase. For *can*, *You cannot go home* = *You
can not go home* = NOT(CAN(P)). But for *must*, *You must not go home* is
ambiguous — it can mean MUST(NOT(P)) (the reading that *mustn't*
unambiguously selects).

This scope irregularity is predicted by the inflectional-affix analysis:
if *-n't* is an affix, it forms a lexical unit with the auxiliary, and
lexical items can have idiosyncratic scope properties. If *-n't* were
a clitic (a reduced form of *not*), its scope should always match *not*.

We formalize this using `box`/`diamond` from
`Intensional`: a Kripke countermodel exhibits
an accessibility relation under which the two scope readings diverge. -/
