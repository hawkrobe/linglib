# Nadathur and Lauer (2020)

Nadathur and Lauer analyse periphrastic *make* as asserting causal sufficiency and *cause* as
asserting causal necessity, both relative to a background situation in a structural-equation
dynamics. The two relations come apart: restoring power is necessary but not sufficient for a
fire whose other condition is unknown, so *cause* is felicitous and *make* is not, while Ava's
training is sufficient but not necessary for Lia's taking the bus. A temporal constraint on
backgrounds blocks *make* for the earlier of two necessary causes, and a constraint on volitional
action, presupposed by *make*, separates it from *let*.

## Main definitions

* `NadathurLauer2020.Make`, `NadathurLauer2020.Cause`: the lexical entries (25)
* `NadathurLauer2020.denotation`: the entry the paper gives a causative class
* `NadathurLauer2020.TemporalLocationConstraint`: the constraint (28) on backgrounds
* `NadathurLauer2020.VolitionalActionConstraint`: the constraint on volitional action (43)

## Main results

* `NadathurLauer2020.Make.solve_eq`: *make* entails that the effect occurs (footnote 20)
* `NadathurLauer2020.not_forall_causallySufficient_imp_causallyNecessary`,
  `NadathurLauer2020.not_forall_causallyNecessary_imp_causallySufficient`: neither relation
  implies the other
* the judgments on the circuit (26), fire (31), bus (33), lighthouse (35) and dancing (40)–(44)
  scenarios

## Implementation notes

A dynamics is a `CausalModel` whose exogenous variables read the context, a situation is a
partial assignment, and the evaluation world of an entry is the actual world of a context.
Necessity is (24) over every supersituation, `CausalModel.CausallyNecessary (· ≤ ·)`; a
supersituation settling a variable between cause and effect can then reach the effect without the
cause, as in the persuasion chain, but each of the paper's necessity claims concerns a parent of
the effect. Adding a fact (22a) is `Function.update`, which overrides a value the situation already
fixes, as (43) needs when the background fixes the intention. The subtraction `s ∖ (C = 1)` of
(25) clears the cause whether or not `s` fixes it, and the requirement `s ⊆ w_e` is a hypothesis
where it is used. In (43) a background determines the intention when its strict development
settles it. The paper sets preemption aside, and so does the formalization.
