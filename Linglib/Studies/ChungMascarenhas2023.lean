# Chung and Mascarenhas (2023): Modality, expected utility, and hypothesis testing

This file formalizes the semantics of necessity modals as expected value that Chung and
Mascarenhas propose, together with its applications to the miners puzzle and to two reasoning
fallacies, and the derivations the paper runs against the rival accounts.

Necessity modals share one semantics over a family `R` of relevant propositions: `expectedValue`
is the conditional expectation of the number `countTrue R` of relevant propositions true at a
world ((5) and (7)), equal to the sum of the likelihoods of the evidence (12), and `must φ` holds
when `φ`'s expected value alone clears a threshold `θ` (6). Read deontically the expectation is
`φ`'s expected utility, read epistemically its explanatory value; `ought φ` asks instead that `φ`
be strictly best among the good-enough (17) and follows from `must φ` (`ought_of_must`); `might`
is `must`'s dual with the polar alternative (59); and the §5 plausibility patch `mustPlausible`
adds a reasonably high prior for the prejacent. A prejacent entailing all its evidence has
maximal explanatory value (`expectedValue_eq_card_of_subset`), the §7 question-begging
`P(φ ∣ φ)` and the §5 problem of success, and the deontic reading is Lassiter's expected-value
scale (`toReal_expectedValue`), the paper's "reproduction of Lassiter's analysis". The Korean
conditional evaluative *cip-ey iss-eya toy-n-ta* composes the evaluative predicate, the
conditional, Lassiter's threshold (46) and the *-(e)ya* exhaustifier into exactly (6) (§4, (48)).

In the miners puzzle of Kolodny and MacFarlane (§3.1), stated over any measure satisfying the
paper's assumptions (equiprobable locations independent of the action, with `uniformOn` as
witness) and the ideals (18) of Cariani, Kaufmann and Kaufmann, blocking neither shaft is the
only good-enough option for a threshold between 5 and 9 (26a), the conditional *must* needs one
between 9 and 10 (25b), and no single threshold serves both (`must_thresholds_incompatible`);
`kratzer_miners_unsatisfiable` is the paper's proof sketch (16) that no ordering source lets the
classical account verify all of (15a)–(15c), and `expectedValue_inA_lt_inA_blockNeither` is
footnote 17's observation that blocking neither stays above the expected utility of
indifference. The modal conjunction fallacy (34) and modal base-rate neglect (41) are theorems
about `must` over every measure realizing the paper's printed conditional probabilities, each
with a finite witness model; the Kratzer row of Table 2 is `Modality.necessity_and_left`,
conjunction elimination, which the expected-value `must` escapes.

## Implementation notes

* The paper world-indexes the probability function `Pr_w` (its fn 9); the formalization fixes a
  single measure, as no formalized claim varies the evaluation world.
* Alternative sets are explicit `Set (Set W)` arguments (the paper's fn 8 leaves their source to
  the question under discussion); `might` hard-codes the polar alternative, following §6.
* Printed probabilities enter as hypotheses on conditional measures, decimals as
  `ENNReal.ofReal` values and the miners' utilities as exact numerals; no parallel rational
  arithmetic.
* The alternative log-likelihood formulation ((13)–(14)) and its `might` variant are not
  formalized: the paper sets them aside after noting (6) suffices.
