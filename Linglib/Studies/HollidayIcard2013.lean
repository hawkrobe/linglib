# Holliday and Icard (2013): Measure semantics and qualitative semantics for epistemic modals

Holliday and Icard compare semantics for the comparative epistemic modal *at least as likely
as* against the inference patterns of their Figure 1: Yalcin's V1–V7, V11, V12 and I1–I3, and
V13, which Lassiter suggested. Kratzer's world-ordering semantics, which lifts a preorder on
worlds to propositions by Lewis's l-lifting, validates the invalid patterns and misses V11 and
V13; Kratzer's later k-lifting does no better for disjoint propositions. Finitely additive
measures validate exactly the intended patterns, but so do the paper's two qualitative
alternatives, qualitatively additive measures and the m-lifting. What separates the two kinds
of additivity is Kraft, Pratt and Seidenberg's ordering on five worlds, the paper's World Cup
comparisons (3)–(6), which the paper doubts speakers find inconsistent.

## Main results

* `lLift_validities`, `disjunction_problem`, `lLift_refutes_V11_V13`: Fact 1. The l-lifting's
  V12, which Yalcin counts among the account's failures, follows from its I2.
* `measure_validities`, `qualAddMeasure_validities` and the refutations of I1–I3: Facts 2, 3.
* `mLift_validities`, `mLift_refutes_I_patterns`: Fact 5. By `measure_le_of_matchingLift` the
  m-lifting is sound for any measure that agrees with the world ordering on singletons.
* `worldCup_not_finitelyAdditive`, `fa_representable_iff_card_lt_five`: Theorem 8.

## Implementation notes

* The paper's finitely additive measures are mathlib's probability measures on a discrete
  measurable space; on the paper's finite spaces the two coincide.
* `□` and `◇` are the paper's quantifiers over the epistemic space, `A = Set.univ` and
  `A ≠ ∅`, with every world accessible, so V6 comes from non-triviality and V7 from
  monotonicity. The order-internal `◇A := ¬ ∅ ⩾ A` agrees with this for the liftings but, over
  the measures, only for regular ones.
* V8–V10, which Fact 1 names but Figure 1 leaves out, are not formalized.
* The refutations use the uniform measure on three worlds and the indiscriminate world order on
  two or three worlds. Theorems 2, 6 and 8 are represented by the model-theoretic results they
  rest on; Theorems 3–5 and 7 and Fact 4 concern the logics themselves.
* Figure 7's chain of four worlds shows the two liftings apart: only the l-lifting makes `{a}`
  more likely than `{b, c}`, and the m-lifting leaves `{a, d}` and `{b, c}` incomparable.

## TODO

* The FA-consistency of (3)–(6) is witnessed by the Kraft–Pratt–Seidenberg order of the
  substrate under a different labelling of the worlds; state it for the World Cup labelling.
