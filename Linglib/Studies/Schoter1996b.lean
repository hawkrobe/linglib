# Schöter (1996b): Evidential Bilattice Logic and Lexical Inference

This file formalizes the value space of the paper's Evidential Bilattice Logic. Natural
reasoning is partial, paraconsistent, relevant and defeasible, and the paper captures the four
properties by climbing a progression of lattices (Fig. 1): the classical two values, Kleene's
three, Belnap's `FOUR`, and the evidential bilattice `PRESUP` over the chain `0 < ½ < 1`, whose
values are pairs of degrees of evidence for and against a proposition (`PRESUP`, the
substrate's `Bilattice.Evidential (Fin 3)`), so that presumptions, confusion and defeated
defaults join the gap and the glut. `FOUR` embeds in it preserving both orders (`embed_le`,
`embed_kLE`). The evidential space is partitioned into Fitting's classical and consistent
values and the paper's designated and semi-designated ones, with the paper's order-theoretic
characterizations of the latter two (`designated_iff_top_kLE`, `semiDesignated_iff`). The
semi-designation function, the `presumably` operator of the evaluation clauses and the
evidential weighting that keeps only the dominant evidence are value-level connectives
(`semiDesignation`, `presumably`, `weight`), the last mapping `PRESUP` onto the constants of
[ginsberg-1988]'s default bilattice without being a homomorphism.

## Implementation notes

* The paper writes a value as `⟨against, for⟩`, reversing Fitting's coordinate order to fit its
  diagrams; this file keeps the substrate's `(for, against)` order, so the paper's `⟨a, b⟩` is
  `.mk b a` here.
* The paper's epistemic states, evidential links, its assertion, evaluation and closure
  semantics, and the §4 analyses of entailment, implicature and presupposition that run on
  them are not formalized; only the value level is.

The recursive evaluation clauses of Definition 14 are value-functional except for the
inference-link connective: clause 1 is `Product.neg`, clauses 3 and 4 are `⊓` and `⊔`, clause 5
is Fitting's guard, and clause 2, the `presumably` operator, is built from the guard and the
semi-designation function. -/
