# Blok (2015): The semantics and pragmatics of directional numeral modifiers

This file formalizes the paper's account of directional numeral modifiers, the prepositions of
direction used to modify a numeral, such as *up to*. They differ from the other modifiers that
set an upper bound, such as *at most*: their lower bound cannot be cancelled and their upper
bound can, they are odd with the lowest number of a scale, and they do not license negative
polarity items. The paper derives the differences from two claims. A directional modifier
asserts a lower bound and only implicates its upper bound, and every Class B modifier needs a
range of values to quantify over.

The implementation follows the paper's, in unrestricted inquisitive semantics. A sentence
denotes a set of possibilities. *Up to n* raises the possibilities that at least `m` hold, for
`m` from the bottom `s` of the scale to `n`, so its informational content is that at least `s`
hold (`sUnion_upTo`), with no upper bound. Exhaustifying each possibility against the question
of how many leaves the possibilities of exactly `m`, and the upper bound `n` is an implicature
(`sUnion_exh_upTo`). *At most n*, on Coppock and Brochhagen's analysis, raises the
possibilities between `m` and `n`, so its content is the upper bound and is compatible with
zero (`sUnion_atMost`). The range requirement is that the sentence raise more than one
possibility, which fails for *up to* at the bottom of the scale and for *at most 0*
(`nontrivial_upTo`, `nontrivial_atMost`). The paper's judgments on the two kinds of modifier
are checked against these predictions (`judgment_rows`).

## Implementation notes

Worlds are counts, as in the paper's simplified model with one world for each number. A
proposition is a `Set (Set ℕ)` and not the library's `Question`, which is downward closed and
identifies a proposition with its maximal possibilities, while the possibilities of *up to*
are nested. The denotation of *at most* is the set of possibilities the paper computes from
Coppock and Brochhagen's entry, not that entry, whose choice functions and ordered states are
not modelled. The bottom of the scale is `1` in the rows, the whole numbers.

/-! ### The two denotations -/

/-- (45): *up to `n`* on a scale with bottom `s` raises the possibilities that at least `m`
hold, for each `m` from `s` to `n`. -/
def upTo (s n : ℕ) : Set (Set ℕ) := Ici '' Icc s n

/-- (43c): *at most `n`* raises the possibilities that between `m` and `n` hold, for each `m`
up to `n`. -/
def atMost (n : ℕ) : Set (Set ℕ) := (Icc · n) '' Iic n

/-- The informational content of *up to `n`* is its lower bound. At least the bottom of the
scale hold, and nothing bounds the count from above. -/

  exact ⟨fun ⟨m, _, hk⟩ ↦ hk.2, fun hk ↦ ⟨0, Nat.zero_le n, Nat.zero_le k, hk⟩⟩

/-! ### The implicated upper bound -/

/-- (50): exhaustification removes from each possibility the worlds of the possibilities of the
question under discussion that it does not entail. -/

/-- (51): exhaustification turns the possibilities of *up to `n`* into those of exactly `m`, for
`m` from the bottom of the scale to `n`. -/

/-! ### The range requirement -/

/-- *Up to `n`* raises more than one possibility just in case `n` is above the bottom of the
scale, which is the bottom-of-the-scale effect. -/

/-! ### Monotonicity

The asserted content of *up to* is closed upward and that of *at most* downward, so only
*at most* is downward monotone and licenses negative polarity items. -/

/-! ### The judgments -/

/-- The diagnostics of the paper's examples are a continuation *if any*, a contrast with
*no-one*, a continuation that cancels or reinforces the upper bound, a bare sentence testing
the range requirement, and a negative polarity item. -/

  | ifAny | butNone | upperBound | range | npi

  | "evenMore" | "noMore" => some .upperBound
  | "range" => some .range

by whether the modifier is directional. -/
def proposition (directional : Bool) (n : ℕ) : Set (Set ℕ) :=
  if directional then upTo 1 n else atMost n

/-- What the account predicts acceptable. *If any* needs content compatible with zero and the
contrast with *no-one* content that excludes it. Cancelling or reinforcing the upper bound needs
a bound that is not asserted. A bare sentence needs more than one possibility, and a negative
polarity item downward monotone content. -/
