# Harris and Potts (2009): Perspective-shifting with appositives and expressives

This file formalizes [harris-potts-2009]'s account of whose commitments an appositive or
expressive expresses. The two-dimensional meaning of [potts-2005] is kept, but the
conventional-implicature content carries a free orientation variable, resolved in discourse to
the speaker or to another participant (`CIItem.resolve`). Orientation is public commitment: an
utterance commits the speaker to the at-issue content and whoever the item is oriented to to the
implicature (`CIItem.utter`), so under a non-speaker-oriented reading the speaker's commitment
set narrows by the at-issue content alone (`contextSet_utter_speaker_other`). Against the
configurational hypothesis, on which non-speaker orientation is semantic binding by an attitude
predicate (their (10a)), the paper sets the contextual one (their (10b)): speaker orientation is
a default that pragmatic factors override in any syntactic position. The attested readings and
the items of the two experiments are the rows of `Data/Examples/HarrisPotts2009.json`, and
`not_configurational` is the paper's refutation: their (11) and (12) are epithets in matrix
clauses read from another's perspective. Experiment 1 extends this to appositives, read as the
attitude subject's in 68% of unembedded and 86% of embedded trials, so that embedding
facilitates the shift without being required for it; Experiment 2 finds a negative context
raising subject-oriented readings of a matrix epithet from 7% to 17%; and the corpus study
finds speaker orientation dominant, in 32 of the 34 embedded appositive relatives with agreed
textual evidence.

## Implementation notes

The commitment state is `Commitment.State` over `Orientation`, so the values of the orientation
variable are exactly the possible committers. The `Both` response of the experiments, which the
paper reads as pragmatic enrichment of one attribution, is recorded in the rows but not
modelled, and the regression models of their §3.3 and §4.3 stay in prose. The rows of the
experimental items carry their conditions, not the per-item response counts, which the paper
reports only in aggregate.
