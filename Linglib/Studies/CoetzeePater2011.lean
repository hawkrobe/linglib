# Coetzee and Pater (2011): The Place of Variation in Phonological Theory

Coetzee and Pater compare grammatical models of phonological variation on English word-final
t/d-deletion (*west* ~ *wes*). Their four constraints (11) protect t/d by MAX everywhere and by
MAX-PRE-V and MAX-FINAL before a vowel and phrase-finally, so every ranking that deletes anywhere
deletes before a consonant, as Labov's generalization over the dialects of (10) requires. In the
partially ordered constraints (POC) model of Kiparsky and Anttila a grammar draws one of its
linear extensions uniformly, and the probability of deletion is the share of them that delete.

Any distribution over rankings, POC's or stochastic OT's, therefore deletes most before a
consonant, and so does Noisy Harmonic Grammar with noisy weights clamped at zero; MaxEnt with
negative weights does not, and variable rules fit any rates. Harmonic Grammar also expresses the
cumulative devoicing of Japanese loanwords, which no distribution over rankings matches and Noisy
HG matches exactly.

## Implementation notes

Locators follow the ROA-946 draft of 6 October 2009, and the printed tables are read from
`Data/Experiments/CoetzeePater2011.json`. Constraint indices follow (11): 0 is \*CT, 1 MAX,
2 MAX-PRE-V and 3 MAX-FINAL, while (23) prints them in the order \*CT, MAX-PRE-V, MAX-FINAL,
MAX. The constraint values of stochastic OT in (14), (21) and (23) come from Praat simulations
and are read as data, not derived.

## TODO

* Rows (b)–(e) of (13) print counts that (9) does not give: counting the linear extensions of
  their grammars gives 0, 2, 4; 8, 6, 8; 2, 0, 4; and 6, 8, 8 of 12, and only the two zero cells
  agree (`deletionProb_eq_pocRates_iff`). Each printed cell is the rate of the two-stratum
  grammar that ranks the fixed faithfulness constraint in a stratum of its own, as if the other
  pairs stayed free. The published chapter has not been checked for a correction.
* §3.3 says that POC can derive only 0, .50 and 1 for pre-consonantal deletion; the grammar of
  row (b) derives 1/3 (`deletionProb_maxPreVOverStarCT_preC_not_mem`).
* p. 21 says that no ranking "yields deletion in only pre-consonantal position", which row (d) of
  (12) does; the argument needs deletion everywhere except pre-consonantally.
* (24) with the two-place weights of (25) gives 33/131, about .252, before a vowel in Tejano,
  where (25) prints 25.03: Goldvarb's expected rates use its unrounded weights.
