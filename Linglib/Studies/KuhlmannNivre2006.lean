# Kuhlmann & Nivre (2006): Mildly Non-Projective Dependency Structures

This file formalizes the paper's comparison of the constraints proposed for mildly
non-projective dependency structures: planarity, well-nestedness, gap degree, and the edge
degree of [nivre-2006]. The first three, with the dominance and projection they are stated
through, are the substrate of `Syntax/DependencyGrammar/`, whose definitions follow the paper;
edge degree, the number of constituents an edge spans without dominating, is `edgeDegree`, and
`edgeDegree_eq_zero_iff` proves for it the paper's observation that degree zero is
projectivity, as `Graph.isProjective_iff_gapDegree_eq_zero` proves it for gap degree. The
hierarchy projective ⊂ planar ⊂ well-nested is the substrate's; the paper's figures supply the
witnesses that keep the inclusions strict, that separate the two graded measures, and that
show well-nestedness independent of both.

The counts of Table 1 are the rows of `Data/Treebank/Coverage/KuhlmannNivre2006.json`, over
which the paper's percentages are recomputed: about 15% of the Danish and 23% of the Prague
trees are non-projective (`nonProjective_share`), a degree bound of one covers more than 98% of
both treebanks on either measure (`degreeLe1_coverage`), and among the non-projective trees
planarity covers fewer than a quarter while well-nestedness covers more than 99%
(`nonProjective_binary`).

## Implementation notes

Positions are zero-based, so node `i` of a figure is position `i - 1`. A connected component
of the subgraph an edge's span induces is identified by its root, the position of the span
whose head lies outside it or which is the root of the graph, so the degree of an edge counts
those positions its head does not dominate. The trees of the figures are read off the
drawings, and the paper's remarks about them, the projections of the nodes marked `i`, the
edges of degree one, and the interleaving subtrees, are proved of the reconstructions.
Percentages are recomputed from the rows as rounded hundredths of a percent, the precision the
paper prints, and the subtable over non-projective trees is the difference from the projective
row, since planarity and well-nestedness each contain projectivity.

## TODO

* The paper gives the coverage of edge degree at most one on DDT as 98.24%, the sum of the
  printed 84.95% and 13.29%; the rows give 98.25%.
