# Rubinstein (2014): On Necessity and Comparison

This file formalizes [rubinstein-2014]'s account of weak necessity as comparison. Following
[sloman-1970], the priorities of [kratzer-1981]'s ordering source are split by negotiability
((48)–(49)): the priorities every participant is committed to are promoted to the modal base and,
with the circumstances, delimit the favored worlds through [frank-1996]'s compatibility-restricted
union ((39)–(40)), while the negotiable priorities an opinionated assessor promotes remain an
ordering source. Strong necessity is simple necessity over the favored worlds (41), weak
necessity is human necessity over them under the negotiable ordering (42), and the ordering
source of a weak necessity presupposes negotiability (50). The tax-report dialogue is the shift
from *should* to *have to* as an ideal stops being negotiable ((46), (51)), and neg-raising
follows from the choice between a negotiable ideal and its negation (§3.4.2). Weak necessity
modals form a natural class with the evaluative comparatives *good*, *better*, *preferable* and
*worthwhile*, diagnosed by the strength tests of §2.1 and by neg-raising after [horn-1978], and
Hebrew reaches weak necessity through the comparatives alone.

## Main definitions

* `Backgrounds`, `extensions`, `favoredWorlds`: the circumstances, the promoted priorities and
  the negotiable ordering source; the maximal consistent sets of promoted priorities; and Frank's
  union over them.
* `strongNecessity`, `weakNecessity`: (41) and (42).
* `Negotiable`: (49), a list of ideals some participant is not committed to.

## Main results

* `favoredWorlds_eq_bestWorlds`: Frank's compatibility-restricted union is Kratzer's best worlds
  under the promoted priorities, a best world being one whose verified priorities form a maximal
  consistent set (`verified_mem_extensions`, `mem_bestWorlds_of_extension`), so the two
  necessities are [von-fintel-iatridou-2008]'s strong and weak necessity with the split ordering
  source (`strongNecessity_iff`, `weakNecessity_iff`); the analyses differ only in the
  negotiability presupposition.
* `tax_shift`: the negotiable ideal makes *should* true and *have to* false, and its endorsement
  leaves it non-negotiable and makes *have to* true.
* `weakNecessity_ideal`, `weakNecessity_neg_of_not`: a choice of ideal is a choice of weak
  necessities, from which the neg-raising inference for the ideal follows.
* `negRaising_iff_comparative`, `carix_negRaises`, `strength_tests`: over the paper's English,
  Hebrew and Spanish rows, neg-raising and the strength tests pick out the weak necessities, with
  *carix* the paper's apparent exception.

## Implementation notes

* Commitment (48) is data, a finite set of ideals per participant, and an ideal list is
  negotiable when some participant is not committed to one of its members. The presupposition
  (50) is stated through the negotiability conjuncts of `tax_shift` rather than as a partial
  operator. Backgrounds are relative to worlds, not to the paper's events.
* The neg-raising rows of [horn-1978] carry Horn's page numbers as their source labels. Narrog's
  survey (Table 1) and the tentative possibility semantics for *preferable* are not formalized.
