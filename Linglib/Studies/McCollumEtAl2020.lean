# McCollum, Baković, Mai and Meinhardt (2020): Unbounded circumambient patterns

ATR harmony in Tutrugbu spreads `[+ATR]` from the root leftward onto every prefix vowel unless
the initial vowel is `[+high]`, in which case a `[−high]` prefix vowel blocks it. McCollum,
Baković, Mai and Meinhardt show that this segmental pattern is unbounded circumambient in
Jardine's sense, their (13), like the tonal patterns Jardine took to be special: the surface
value of a medial `[−high]` vowel depends at once on the root to its right and on the initial
vowel to its left, however far away both are. No subsequential transducer computes the map in
either direction, (27), but a right-to-left pass that leaves some vowels undecided followed by
a left-to-right pass that decides them does, (28) and (29), so by Elgot and Mezei's
composition theorem the map is regular.

## Main definitions

* `Seg`: a prefix vowel with its height and ATR value, or a root with its ATR value
* `Harmonizes`: the paper's generalization, the context in which a prefix vowel harmonizes
* `tutrugbu`: the harmony as a docking process
* `markRight`, `resolveLeft`: the two passes of the mark-up analysis

## Main results

* `tutrugbu_map_forms`: the map takes every word of (1) to (8) and (27) to its surface form
* `tutrugbu_requiresBothSides`, `tutrugbu_twoSidedUnboundedDependence`: unbounded
  circumambience, (13)
* `tutrugbu_not_isSubsequential`: no subsequential analysis in either direction, (27)
* `tutrugbu_map_eq_resolve_mark`, `tutrugbu_isBimachineComputable`: the mark-up analysis, and
  the regularity it shows

## Implementation notes

* A word is its prefix vowels and its root, the consonants dropped as in the transducers of the
  paper's supplementary materials. Prefixes are underlyingly `[−ATR]` (§2.3.1), and docking
  raises a prefix vowel to `[+ATR]`.
* The words of `Data/Forms/McCollumEtAl2020.json` are transcribed from the page images, with
  the source's misprints recorded in their comments. The vowel of the negation prefix, printed
  much like ⟨í⟩, is a distinct glyph in the PDF and is read as ⟨ɪ́⟩, as the column headers of
  (3) and (5) and the tape (26) require.
* Not modelled: the conditionally transparent variant of §2.2, the suffixes and enclitics of
  (10), and phrasal harmony (11).
* The paper's conclusion that the map is not weakly deterministic uses Heinz and Lai's
  definition (17) informally, and its fn. 10 records that the definition admits mark-up-free
  loopholes, so the conclusion is not stated here.

The witness is a run of `[−high]` vowels between the initial vowel and the root. With a
`[−high]` initial and a `[+ATR]` root the whole run harmonizes, as in (8h); a `[+high]` initial
blocks it, as in (8g); a `[−ATR]` root triggers nothing, as in (5a) against (5d). -/

/-! ### The mark-up analysis

The right-to-left pass (28), Fig. 8 of the supplementary materials, decides each prefix vowel
it can: before a `[−ATR]` root a vowel stays `[−ATR]`, and a `[+high]` vowel before a `[+ATR]`
root with no `[−high]` vowel in between is `[+ATR]`. From the first `[−high]` vowel leftward it
leaves the value open, writing Ê for a `[+high]` vowel and Ψ for a `[−high]` one. The
left-to-right pass (29), Fig. 9, reads the height of the initial vowel: if it is `[+high]` the
blocking conditions hold and every open vowel stays `[−ATR]`, and otherwise every open vowel is
`[+ATR]`. -/

/-- A symbol of the intermediate alphabet is a decided segment, or a prefix vowel of known
height whose ATR value is left open, Ê when `[+high]` and Ψ when `[−high]`. -/
