# Possessor extraction and categorical subject in Tseltalan

Aissen and Polian argue that a Tseltalan possessor never Ā-subextracts: nominal opacity, a
Keine horizon at N⁰ for the wh-probe on C⁰, forces an extracted possessor to A-move first to
Spec,TP or Spec,ApplP, where Attract Closest over DPs decides whether it can — a specific
possessive's D layer, an agent, a specific subject or theme, or an occupied Spec,ApplP stops
it. Hence only non-specific possessums strand, and the possessor that reaches Spec,TP is the
ψ-subject of a categorical judgment.

Nominal opacity is the profile `nominalOpacity` read through `Invisible`, Attract Closest is
`isClosestGoalIn` over D-bearing leaves on the paper's structures, `judgment` reads the
judgment type off the same search, and the paper's examples are the rows, over which
`stranding_iff`, `piedPiping_specific` and `psi_no_piedPiping` hold.
