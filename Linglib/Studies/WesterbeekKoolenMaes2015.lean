# Westerbeek, Koolen & Maes (2015): Stored Object Knowledge and the Production of Referring Expressions

This file formalizes the computational claim of [westerbeek-koolen-maes-2015]. In two
production experiments, speakers referring to an object whose type alone distinguishes it from
the distractors mention its color more often the less typical that color is for the object,
and more so for objects whose shape is less diagnostic, which the paper attributes to a
contrast with the color stored with the object's category. The paper argues that models of
content determination without object knowledge cannot capture this: [dale-reiter-1995]'s
Incremental Algorithm, which considers attributes in a fixed preference order and keeps one
only when it rules out a remaining distractor, produces the bare head noun whenever the type
distinguishes the referent, whatever the colors in the scene
(`flat_makeReferringExpression_type`), so its output for a yellow and a red tomato is the same
(`makeReferringExpression_congr_type`) and its color-mention rate cannot vary with typicality
(`decision_rule_not_ia`).

## Implementation notes

The scenes are the flat domains of the Incremental Algorithm's user model, in which the user
knows a property exactly when the scene has it. The paper's decision rule, that the
probability of mentioning a property rises with its contrast to stored knowledge, is a
strictly decreasing rate in the typicality score; the experiments' rates and regression
coefficients are reported in the paper and not formalized.
