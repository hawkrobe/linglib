# Hafeez (2025): Agentivity and causation in Urdu

[hafeez-2025] asks which Urdu causal constructions speakers accept for which causal scenes. The
scenes are the 43 video clips of the Causality Across Languages project, and they vary along three
variables: the causer is an intentional human (IHCr), an accidental human (AHCr) or a natural
force (NFCr); the second participant of the chain is a controlling human causee (ContrHCEAF), a
physically or a psychologically impacted human (PhysImpHCEAF, PsychImpHCEAF) or an inanimate
affectee (InanCEAF); and a third participant does or does not mediate the chain (Mediation).

The acceptability study (chapter 5) had twelve raters judge a description of every clip in each of
seven response types, and fits one conditional inference tree per response type. Each leaf of a
tree is a conjunction of signed predictors such as [+IHCr, -Mediation, +InanCEAF], and the leaf
with the highest share of ceiling ratings is the response type's hypothesized semantic prototype
when that share exceeds 50% (Table 18). The response types are the lexical ergative LEX-ERG
(ergative causer, transitive verb), the lexical instrumental LEX-INST (instrumental causer,
intransitive verb), the lexical dative LEX-DAT (dative causee or affectee, infinitive and light
verb), the morphological causative verb MCV (the indirect causative *-va*; verbs with the direct
causative *-aa* count as lexical), the adverbial ADV (two clauses joined by *keyoonkeh*
'because'), the non-sentential cause adjunct NCA (a cause NP with *=par*, *wajhan=se* or *=se*)
and the non-sentential causer adjunct NCrA (a causer NP with *wajhan=se*). The printed tables are
`Data/Experiments/Hafeez2025`.

* **The coding.** A clip's scene is read off its name by the code of Appendix L
  (`Clip.scene`), and every clip is a scene the design can stage (`clips_stageable`). The
  predictor table as printed (Table 4) codes five clips otherwise (`table4_disagreements`), and
  it cannot be the coding the trees were fit on: three leaves hold more responses than twelve
  raters give their clips under it (`table4_exceeded`), while under the clip names no leaf does
  (`responses_le`) and all but three hold exactly that many (`responses_shortfall`).
* **The trees.** The trees reproduce Table 18's leaves with their node numbers (`tree_leaves`)
  and partition the scenes (`leaves_partition`, from `Tree.countP_leaves`). Table 18 prints the
  InanCEAF split of the ADV tree with reversed signs: section 5.3.5 puts the 90.8% peak on
  [-InanCEAF], and with the printed signs no ADV leaf holds its clips' responses
  (`adv_printed_misfit`). Every printed percentage is a count out of its responses except the
  0.08 of the LEX-INST tree (`attainablePercent_iff`).
* **The prototypes** are derived as the highest leaf above 50% (`prototype`); LEX-DAT has none
  (`prototype_eq_none_iff`). Table 19 prints the peaks of NCA and NCrA swapped
  (`summary_percent_swapped`). The printed prototypes of Tables 19 and 25 denote the derived
  ones (`summary_iff_prototype`), LEX-ERG's only on stageable scenes, since it drops the leaf's
  [-Mediation] (`lexErg_summary_not_prototype`), and ADV's is the complement of the derived one
  (`adv_summary_iff_not_prototype`).
* **Agentivity.** The agentivity reading of the prototypes in the chapter's conclusion
  (`lexErg_full`, `ncrA_nonagentive`, …) follows from the prototypes and the agentivity degrees of
  the participants.
* **Production.** The production study's preferences (chapter 6, Table 25) refine the
  prototypes, the dovetailing the abstract reports (`individual_le_prototype`). The combined
  model's NCA preference reaches the clip of a woman startled by thunder, outside the NCA
  prototype (`nca_combined_not_le_prototype`).
* **Comrie.** The LEX-ERG prototype is unmediated and the MCV prototype mediated
  (`lexErg_mcv_mediation`), the order [comrie-1989]'s compactness generalization demands of a
  lexical and a morphological causative (`lexErg_mcv_comrieMonotone`).

## Implementation notes

The second participant is one variable with four values, so a scene type such as
[-ContrHCEAF, +InanCEAF] and its shorter form [+InanCEAF] are equivalent, which is how Table 18's
LEX-INST leaf and the LEX-INST prototype of Tables 19 and 25 agree. The scene's mediation is the
substrate's `Causation.Morphological.Mediation`: [+Mediation] is a third participant between
causer and result, the narrow sense of directness the dissertation distinguishes from the broad
one.
