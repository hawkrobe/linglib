# Sutton & Filip (2021) — The Count/Mass Distinction for Granular Nouns
[sutton-filip-2021]

Formalizes the core of:

  Sutton, P. R. & Filip, H. (2021). The count/mass distinction for granular
  nouns. In H. Filip (ed.), *Countability in Natural Language*, 252–291.
  Cambridge University Press.

## The account

Lexical entries are tripartite (their (33)): a basic predicate (`baspred`,
number-neutral conceptual content), a counting base (`cbase`), and an
extension. Two mechanisms mediate between them: the **object identifying
function** 𝒪 (their (30)), which selects the perceptually/functionally
salient units if the concept specifies any, and **individuation schemas**
𝒮ᵢ, which select a maximally disjoint subset of those units; the **null
schema** 𝒮₀ (their (32)) instead unions *all* maximally disjoint subsets.
Grammatical counting requires a disjoint counting base, so:

* count = `[+O, +S]` (a specific schema over identified objects — *cat*,
  *lentil*, Finnish *huonekalut* 'items of furniture');
* mass = `[−S]` (null schema): either `[+O, −S]` (*furniture* — objects
  identified but overlapping, so cardinality comparison is available) or
  `[−O, −S]` (*rice*, Czech *čočka* 'lentil', *mud* — no object function
  in the counting base at all).

The **accessibility puzzle**: *rice* denotes stuff made of perceptually
salient, *disjoint* grains, yet `#three rices` cannot mean 'three grains of
rice' (only container/subkind readings). On this account the grains live in
`baspred` but are not passed to `cbase` — and an *implicit* unit-extracting
shift would be a generalized `[−O,−S] → [+O,+S]` operation, incompatible
with a lexicalized mass/count distinction (their §9.5.4; Yudja, which
lacks one, counts everything — cf. `Grimm2018.yudjaClassify`).

## Main declarations

* `OverlapPred`/`IsMaxDisjointIn`/`nullSchema` — the schema machinery over
  an arbitrary overlap relation. The disjoint-counting-base thesis and the
  multiple-perspectives ("variants") idea this packages originate with
  [landman-2011] and [landman-2016]; the chapter's own contribution is the
  null schema `𝒮₀` and the unified `𝒪`/`𝒮ᵢ` mechanism. The machinery is a
  graduation candidate when a Landman-anchored study lands.
* `overlapPred_union_of_maxDisjoint_ne` — the load-bearing generic fact:
  the union of two *distinct* maximal disjoint subsets overlaps. Hence
  `nullSchema`-saturated entries are mass whenever individuation is
  perspectival (`overlapPred_nullSchema`), and stable for prototypical
  objects (`nullSchema_eq_of_disjoint`).
* `Categorization` (`[±O, ±S]`) and Table 9.1 (`table91`) over the
  graduated individuation scale (`Features/Individuation.lean`), with the
  junction theorems: the count option *ascends* the scale
  (`count_option_monotone`) and the mass option *descends* it
  (`mass_option_antitone`). Ordering Table 9.1 by [grimm-2018]'s scale is
  this study's bridge, not the chapter's (it cites [grimm-2012] and Grimm &
  Levin 2017, not [grimm-2018]); the theorems show the two frameworks'
  landscapes coincide.
* A concrete furniture/rice model on nonempty `Finset`s: *furniture*'s
  identified units overlap (table vs. vanity), *rice*'s grains are disjoint
  in `baspred` yet its counting base overlaps — the accessibility puzzle's
  two halves (`furniture_units_overlap`, `rice_accessibility`).

## Connections

* Second consumer of the individuation scale — the graduation that moved
  `IndividuationType` to `Features/Individuation.lean` (with [grimm-2018]).
* `MassCount` records the *outcome* of categorization
  (`Categorization.massCount`); the `[±O, ±S]` features are its analysis.
* The cluster/MSSC content of granular `baspred` frames is [grimm-2012]'s
  mereotopology — `Core/Mereotopology.lean`.
* Their counting condition (cardinality only over disjoint bases, their
  (A1), after [landman-2011]'s overlap thesis) is the semantic ground for why
  countability classes, not `Number` values, carry the count/mass
  distinction (`Features/Number/Basic.lean`).

/-! ### Overlap, disjointness, and individuation schemas

Their (16)–(18): the schema machinery (`Mereology.OverlapPred`,
`Mereology.IsMaxDisjointIn`, `Mereology.nullSchema` for `𝒮₀`, their (32))
lives in `Core/Mereology.lean`, shared with [landman-2020]
(`Studies/Landman2020.lean`), whose disjointness thesis it packages.
A predicate is *overlapping* if two distinct members overlap (their (17)
omits the distinctness, under which any inhabited predicate self-overlaps
via `x ∘ x`; the substrate states the intended reading). -/

`[+S]`: it is interpreted under a specific schema `𝒮ᵢ` rather than `𝒮₀`.

/-! ### A concrete model: furniture and rice

Carrier: nonempty subsets of a small atom domain, overlap = nonempty
intersection. *Furniture* (their §9.4.2–9.4.3): a table `t`, a mirror `m`,
and the vanity `t ⊔ m` are all functional units, so `𝒪(furniture)`
overlaps — two individuation perspectives exist (count the vanity as one,
or the table and mirror as two). *Rice*: the basic predicate knows the
grains (disjoint!) and their aggregates, but the `[−O, −S]` counting base
is the null schema over the whole predicate — overlapping. The grains are
real and inaccessible: the accessibility puzzle. -/

    schema over the whole basic predicate) is overlapping, because grain
    and heap perspectives are both maximal. Grammatical counting is

/-! ### Cross-linguistic variation as a schema substitution

Finnish *huonekalut* 'items of furniture' is the count counterpart of
*furniture*: identical basic predicate, with the null schema replaced by a
contextually specified one — `⟦huonekalut⟧^𝒮ᵢ = ⟦furniture⟧^{𝒮₀ ↦ 𝒮ᵢ}`
(their p. 278). On the model: each *specific* perspective on the furniture
units is disjoint, hence countable. The same substitution relates Czech
*čočka* to English *lentil(s)* among granulars. -/

/-- Each specific individuation perspective on the furniture units is a
    disjoint counting base — `[+O, +S]` is count (*huonekalut*), even
    though the `[+O, −S]` null-schema base overlaps (*furniture*). -/
