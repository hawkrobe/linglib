# Elliott (2025): Determiners as predicates

Elliott proposes that a determiner denotes a predicate of groups of polarized individuals rather
than a relation between sets. Every individual `x` has a positive version `x⁺` and a negative
version `x⁻`, no group contains both, and a noun denotes its maximal groups: its extension divided
in every possible way into positive and negative individuals. *Exactly two* holds of the groups
with two positive individuals, and a sentence says that some group of the noun satisfies the
determiner while the scope holds of its positive and fails of its negative individuals. A group
records which members of the restrictor are outside the scope, so these truth conditions are
those of generalized quantifier theory, and the determiners expressible this way are exactly the
conservative ones.

## Main statements

* `classical_lessThan_iff_some`, `classical_zero_false`: on plain pluralities, *less than three
  boys sneezed* says only that some boy sneezed, and *zero boys sneezed* is false.
* `partsOrderIso`: groups ordered by parthood are the sets of polarized individuals that never
  contain both versions of one individual, ordered by inclusion.
* `setOf_noun`, `delta_iff_le`: the groups of a noun are its extension polarized in every possible
  way, and the ∆-operator for a predicate holds of the parts of the group polarized by it.
* `sentence_iff`: a sentence holds when the determiner holds of the noun's extension polarized by
  the scope.
* `lessThan_three_matches_judgments`: unlike the classical entry, *less than three* gets the
  judgments about upper bounds and existential entailment right.
* `toGQ_exactly`, `toGQ_lessThan`, `toGQ_all`, `toGQ_most`: the predicted truth conditions are
  those of the generalized quantifiers.
* `toGQ_ofGQ_eq_iff`, `conservative_toGQ`, `consGQOrderIso`: a generalized quantifier survives the
  round trip through predicates exactly when it is conservative, and the predicates are order
  isomorphic to the conservative quantifiers, whose atoms are the groups (`ofGQ_atom`).
* `card_predicates`, `eqOn_ofGQ_iff`: on `n` individuals there are `2 ^ (3 ^ n - 1)` predicates
  of nonempty groups, and they determine a conservative quantifier up to its value at the empty
  restrictor.
* `all_scopeless`, `exactly_two_not_individual`: existential raising of *all N* is a Montague
  individual and so scopeless, while that of *exactly two N* is not.
* `not_some_singular_collective`: *some boy gathered* is false of a collective predicate.
* `whichDeRe_eq_ker`, `relevant_of_conservative`: the answers to *which N did B?* correspond to
  the groups of the noun, so every conservative determiner is relevant to the question.

## Implementation notes

A group is a function into `Flat Bool`, the paper's trivalent presentation: `⊥` for an absent
individual and `↑true`, `↑false` for the two polarities. Parthood is the pointwise flat order, so
no group contains both versions of an individual. Nouns, like determiners, are predicates of
groups, and the paper's covert existential determiner is `GQ.some` at groups. The paper's domain
has no empty group; `PolarGroup α` has one, `⊥`, with which predicates match the conservative
quantifiers exactly and *all N* and *no N* are singletons even for an empty noun. Restricting to
`X ≠ ⊥` recovers the paper's count and its correspondence up to the empty restrictor. The classical
theory's pluralities are nonempty `Finset`s, and a collective predicate is one true of no atom.

## TODO

* The paper says that the ∆-operator of a collective predicate is true of no group of a singular
  noun, but it is true of the wholly negative group (`delta_collective_iff`); *some boy gathered*
  is false all the same, since *some* requires a positive atom.
* The plural numerals of the last section, which count the atoms inside a positive atom.
