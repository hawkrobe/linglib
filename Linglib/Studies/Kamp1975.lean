# Kamp (1975): Two theories about adjectives

Kamp's first theory treats an adjective as a function from properties to properties,
constrained by meaning postulates that make it predicative, privative or affirmative, with
*alleged* satisfying none; extensionality is a separate dimension. His second theory, for vague
adjectives, gives them partial extensions and, after van Fraassen, derives the comparative from
quantification over the admissible completions: one object is at least as A as another when
every completion that puts the second in the extension puts the first in. A rival definition,
which compares the measures of the completion sets, makes any two objects comparable, which Kamp
rejects for adjectives with several criteria such as *clever*; for one-dimensional adjectives the
two agree. Before this, Kamp argues that no many-valued logic handles borderline cases.

## Main statements

* `intersective_at_world`, `subsective_at_world`: fixing a world sends the intensional classes
  to the classes of single-world predicates.
* `kleene_dilemma`: no truth-functional conjunction is both idempotent at the borderline value
  and false on borderline contradictions.
* `kampMeasureLe_total`, `clever_incomparable`: the measured comparative is total, while the
  completion comparative leaves Smith and Jones incomparable in cleverness.
* `kampPreorder_le_iff_kampMeasureLe`: for one-dimensional adjectives the two comparatives agree.
* `gray_intersective`, `fake_privative`, `skillful_subsective`, `skillful_not_extensional`,
  `alleged_not_subsective`: each class has a member, and extensionality is independent of
  subsectivity.

## Implementation notes

* The measure of (13) is specialized to atomic `ℚ` weights over a finite set of completions;
  only the ordering matters, so the weights need not sum to one.
* The Smith and Jones witness is symmetric, one criterion each; the paper's scenario is
  asymmetric, and the witness shows the incomparability and the forced verdict, not the
  paper's specific outcome.

/-! ### Bridge to single-world predicates

The classification (`Modifier.IsIntersective`, `.IsSubsective`, …) is
one order-theoretic definition instantiated at two carriers: the
intensional `Property W E = W → E → Prop` and the single-world
`E → Prop`. The bridge theorems below show that fixing a world sends
the first instance to the second. -/

section Bridge

variable {W E : Type*}

/-- At a fixed world an intersective modifier of intensional properties is an intersective
modifier of predicates, `N ↦ adj (fun _ ↦ N) w`. -/
theorem intersective_at_world {adj : Modifier (Property W E)}
    (h : IsIntersective adj) (w : W) :
    IsIntersective (fun N : E → Prop ↦ adj (fun _ ↦ N) w) := by
  obtain ⟨Q, hQ⟩ := h
  exact ⟨Q w, fun N ↦ congrFun (hQ fun _ ↦ N) w⟩

/-- At a fixed world a subsective modifier of intensional properties is a subsective modifier
of predicates. -/
theorem subsective_at_world {adj : Modifier (Property W E)}
    (h : IsSubsective adj) (w : W) :
    IsSubsective (fun N : E → Prop ↦ adj (fun _ ↦ N) w) :=
  fun N ↦ h (fun _ ↦ N) w

end Bridge

/-! ### The many-valued dilemma -/

/-- No truth-functional conjunction is both idempotent at the borderline value and false on
borderline contradictions, since with `neg indet = indet` both demands constrain the same pair
of inputs. Kamp states the dilemma (pp. 130–131) for every linearly ordered n-valued logic, of
which `Trivalent` is the smallest. -/
theorem kleene_dilemma :
    ¬∃ (meet : Trivalent → Trivalent → Trivalent),
      meet .indet .indet = .indet ∧
      meet .indet (Trivalent.neg .indet) = .false := by
  rintro ⟨meet, hidem, hcontra⟩
  rw [Trivalent.neg_indet, hidem] at hcontra
  cases hcontra

/-- Strong Kleene conjunction, `⊓` on `Trivalent`, takes the idempotent horn of the dilemma, so
borderline contradictions are not false. -/
example : Trivalent.indet ⊓ Trivalent.indet = Trivalent.indet ∧
    Trivalent.indet ⊓ Trivalent.indetᶜ ≠ ⊥ :=
  ⟨inf_idem _, Trivalent.inf_compl_indet_ne_bot⟩

/-! ### The completion comparative

Definition (12) (paper § 4): u₁ is at least as A as u₂ iff every
admissible completion that puts u₂ in the extension also puts u₁ in it.
[klein-1980] § 5.3 states the strict comparative existentially over
comparison classes; the bridge is
`Klein1980.kleinPreorder_eq_kampPreorder`. -/

/-- Kamp's completion comparative, definition (12) of § 4, is the preorder in which `u₁ ≤ u₂`
when every completion in `S` that puts `u₂` in the extension also puts `u₁` in, so that `≤`
reads *at least as A as*. Kamp credits (12) to [lewis-1970], who attributes it to Kaplan. -/
@[reducible] def kampPreorder {E C : Type*} (ext : C → E → Prop) (S : Set C) :
    Preorder E where
  le u₁ u₂ := ∀ c ∈ S, ext c u₂ → ext c u₁
  le_refl _ := fun _ _ h ↦ h
  le_trans _ _ _ hab hbc := fun c hc h ↦ hab c hc (hbc c hc h)

/-- The completion comparative is antitone in the set of completions, since more completions
make `≤` harder to satisfy. -/
theorem kampPreorder_antitone {E C : Type*} (ext : C → E → Prop) (u₁ u₂ : E) :
    Antitone (fun S ↦ (kampPreorder ext S).le u₁ u₂) :=
  fun _ _ hle hall c hc ↦ hall c (hle hc)

/-! ### Completion and measured comparatives

Kamp's second candidate, definition (13) (paper § 4), compares the
*measures* of the completion sets rather than the sets themselves. His
§ 5 argues against (13) for multi-criteria adjectives: it makes any two
entities comparable, while (12) leaves Smith and Jones incomparable in
cleverness — for Kamp the right verdict. For one-dimensional adjectives
(*heavy*, *tall*, *hot*) the two provably coincide. -/

section MeasuredComparative

variable {E C : Type*} (ext : C → E → Prop) [∀ c e, Decidable (ext c e)]
  (S : Finset C) (p : C → ℚ)

/-- The measured comparative, definition (13) of § 4, holds of `u₁` and `u₂` when the
completions putting `u₂` in the extension weigh at most as much as those putting `u₁` in. -/
def kampMeasureLe (u₁ u₂ : E) : Prop :=
  ∑ c ∈ S with ext c u₂, p c ≤ ∑ c ∈ S with ext c u₁, p c

/-- The measured comparative makes any two objects comparable, Kamp's objection to it in § 5,
which the completion comparative escapes (`clever_incomparable`). -/
theorem kampMeasureLe_total (u₁ u₂ : E) :
    kampMeasureLe ext S p u₁ u₂ ∨ kampMeasureLe ext S p u₂ u₁ :=
  le_total _ _

/-- For nonnegative weights the completion comparative implies the measured one. -/
theorem kampMeasureLe_of_kampPreorder_le (hp : ∀ c ∈ S, 0 ≤ p c) {u₁ u₂ : E}
    (h : (kampPreorder ext (S : Set C)).le u₁ u₂) :
    kampMeasureLe ext S p u₁ u₂ := by

  rw [Finset.mem_filter] at hc ⊢
  exact ⟨hc.1, h c hc.1 hc.2⟩

/-! #### Smith and Jones

Two criteria for *clever* — problem-solving and quick-wittedness — as
two completions; Smith passes one, Jones the other. Under (12) the two
are incomparable, which Kamp argues is correct; (13) must issue a
verdict (`kampMeasureLe_total`). Kamp's own scenario is asymmetric
(Smith *much* better at problems, only slightly worse in wit, so (13)
wrongly makes Smith cleverer); this symmetric toy witnesses the
incomparability and the forced verdict, not that specific outcome. -/

/-- The two criteria of cleverness, problem solving and quick wit. -/
inductive Crit | problemSolving | quickWit deriving DecidableEq

/-- Smith and Jones. -/
inductive P2 | smith | jones deriving DecidableEq

/-- Smith is clever by the first criterion and Jones by the second. -/
def cleverExt : Crit → P2 → Prop
  | .problemSolving, .smith => True
  | .quickWit,       .jones => True
  | _,               _      => False

/-- By the completion comparative Smith and Jones are incomparable in cleverness, which Kamp
takes to capture the comparative correctly for adjectives with several criteria. -/
theorem clever_incomparable :
    ¬ (kampPreorder cleverExt Set.univ).le .smith .jones ∧
    ¬ (kampPreorder cleverExt Set.univ).le .jones .smith :=
  ⟨fun h ↦ h .quickWit trivial trivial,
   fun h ↦ h .problemSolving trivial trivial⟩

/-! #### One-dimensionality -/

/-- An adjective is one-dimensional, as *heavy*, *tall* and *hot* are in § 5, when the
completion sets of any two entities are comparable by inclusion. The condition is Kamp's (18),
stated in § 6. -/
def OneDimensional : Prop :=
  ∀ u₁ u₂ : E, (∀ c ∈ S, ext c u₁ → ext c u₂) ∨ (∀ c ∈ S, ext c u₂ → ext c u₁)

/-- For a one-dimensional adjective and strictly positive weights the two comparatives agree,
Kamp's observation in § 5 that "for this special case the two definitions are equivalent", strict
positivity rendering his proviso that the measure be correctly specified. -/
theorem kampPreorder_le_iff_kampMeasureLe (hp : ∀ c ∈ S, 0 < p c)
    (h18 : OneDimensional ext S) (u₁ u₂ : E) :
    (kampPreorder ext (S : Set C)).le u₁ u₂ ↔ kampMeasureLe ext S p u₁ u₂ := by

/-! ### A member of each class

Each class in the hierarchy is non-empty: explicit denotations that
provably satisfy each definition from `Classification.lean`, modeling
the classic examples from the literature — "gray" (intersective), "fake"
(privative), "skillful" (subsective but not extensional), "alleged"
(non-subsective/modal).

[partee-2010] argues that the privative class should be eliminated
in favor of subsective + noun coercion. The witness `fakeAdj` below
models the traditional analysis; see `Partee2010.lean` for the
coercion reanalysis. -/

is a surgeon, yet skill depends on the noun's intension and not just its current extension, as
in the case of cobblers and darts players that Kamp credits to Lewis. -/
