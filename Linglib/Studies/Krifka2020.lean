# Krifka (2020): Layers of Assertive Clauses: Propositions, Judgements, Commitments, Acts

This file formalizes [krifka-2020]'s decomposition of an assertive clause into a proposition
(TP), a private judgement of it (JP), a public commitment to that judgement (ComP), and the act
that updates the common ground (ActP). A judgement phrase abstracts over the judge of a
judge-relative proposition (`Judgement`); the commitment phrase turns it into the proposition
that the judge is publicly responsible for its truth (`comP`); the assertive act performs a
performative update, which does not restrict the common ground but moves each of its indices
to a successor at which the speaker's commitment holds (`performative`), in contrast to the
informative update of [stalnaker-1978] (`informative`). Commitment closure, the pragmatic
step licensed once every index records a trustworthy speaker's commitment, then adds the
judgement itself (`assertClosed`), and judgement closure adds the proposition judged. On this
account a subjective epistemic adverb like *sicherlich* commits the speaker only to their own
certainty, a proposition easier to defend than the one communicated (`commits_certainly`), and
a reportative like *laut Eva* commits the speaker to Eva's commitment. The layers are ordered,
and clause-embedding predicates select a layer: *abhängen* a proposition, *glauben* and
*wissen* a judgement, *sagen* a commitment, so which modifiers a complement clause admits
follows from the layer selected (`Licensed`).

## Implementation notes

* The branching successor relation `i ⊶ i′[φ]` is a primitive with its one axiom, that `φ`
  holds at the successor; a model supplies it together with the commitment and certainty
  relations. Judgements and commitments share the type of functions from judges to
  propositions, the paper's sortal distinction being carried by the operators that build them.
* The closures are informative updates under their conditions, the trustworthiness and the
  absence of objection being left to the discourse.
* Commitment strength (§3.2) is not modelled: the paper argues it has no discrete values on a
  single dimension. The report readings under which *wissen* and *glauben* embed commitment
  modifiers are noted, not modelled.
