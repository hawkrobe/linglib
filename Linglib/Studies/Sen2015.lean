# Sen (2015): Syllable and Segment in Latin

This file formalizes the second chapter's analysis of clear and dark /l/. The colouring of a
preceding vowel, read off the grammarians' statements and the internal history of Latin words
(§2.3), orders the contexts of /l/ by darkness (18): the syllable coda, then onset /l/ before
/a o u/, before /e/, before /ē/, and last onset /l/ before /i/ and geminate /ll/ (`Context`,
`darkness`; Figure 2.1, `colouring`). The distribution is categorical across three positions and
gradient within one: coda /l/ is dark, geminate /ll/ is clear, and onset /l/ darkens with the
backness of the following vowel. The equipollent analysis (23) states this as surface
specifications on the Fragment's single /l/, `[+high, +back]` in the coda, `[+high, −back]` in
the geminate and `[+high, Ø back]` in the onset (`spec`, `spec_ternary`). The specified variants
sit at the ends of the scale (`coda_darkest`, `geminate_clearest`), colouring follows the scale
(`colouring_monotone`), and the unspecified onset ranges over three degrees (`onset_gradient`):
the specification does not determine darkness, which is why the chapter rejects synchronic
feature spreading as the source of the colouring (§2.5) in favour of phonetic interpolation
through the underspecified segment, in the sense of [keating-1988].

## Implementation notes

* Sen takes /l/ to be underlyingly unspecified for [back], the coda and geminate values being
  filled once a string is syllabified (§2.4); `spec` is the surface specification by position,
  built from the Fragment's /l/ with `Segment.setFeature`.
* `colouring` is the regular outcome of Figure 2.1; its exceptions (after /w j/, after dorsals,
  forms with particular histories) are not encoded. The gradient phonetic implementation
  (Figure 2.3), the diachronic account of the split, and the parallel analysis of /r/ in the
  fourth chapter are out of scope.
