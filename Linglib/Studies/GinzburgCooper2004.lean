# Ginzburg and Cooper (2004): Clarification, Ellipsis, and the Nature of Contextual Updates in Dialogue

This file formalizes the account of clarification ellipsis of [ginzburg-cooper-2004], on which a
sign carries the contextual parameters its sub-utterances introduce
(`LocutionaryProposition.parameters`, `LocutionaryProposition.constituents`), grounding an
utterance is finding an assignment for all of them (`Grounds`, `grounds_iff`), and an addressee
who cannot updates the context instead by a coercion operation on the sign: parameter focussing
raises the question `?i.p`, the content with the problematic parameter abstracted
(`parameterFocussing`), parameter identification the question what the speaker meant by the
sub-utterance (`parameterIdentification`), both making that sub-utterance salient
(`focusEstablishing_parameterFocussing`), and contextual existential generalization quantifies the
parameter away so that the weaker content can be grounded (`existentialGeneralization`,
`grounds_existentialGeneralization`). Since the operations read the constituents of the sign,
utterances with the same content have different clarification potentials
(`potential_ne_of_constituents`): the Hybrid Content Hypothesis, against the purely semantic
updates of dynamic semantics.

The utterance-processing protocol integrates a pending utterance whose parameters the
participant's assignment resolves and otherwise clarifies it (`IS.ground`, `IS.clarify`); after
"Did Bo leave?" the speaker's and the addressee's information states differ in MAX-QUD and
SAL-UTT (`Ex32.differ`), and the speaker comprehends the addressee's fragment by applying the
coercion to her own latest move (`IS.backtrack`, `backtrack_eq_clarify`). A fragment resolves
against the clarification context when it matches the salient sub-utterance in category
(`DeclFrag`); the clausal reading identifies its index with the parameter and so presupposes that
the participants share the sub-utterance's content, the constituent reading does not
(`rows_clausal`, `rows_constituent`), and a fragment of the wrong category has neither
(`rows_parallelism`).

## Implementation notes

* Signs are the substrate's `LocutionaryProposition`, whose constituents' denotations name the
  parameter each contributes; contents are opaque, so existential generalization takes the binder
  as an argument, and parameter labels and contents are written as the paper's strings. A
  contextual parameter is its label: the restrictions of (28) are not represented, grounding asks
  only for a value, and the parameters an assignment leaves unresolved are those contextual
  instantiation of its labels leaves.
* A coercion operation takes the problematic sub-utterance itself, whose denotation is the
  parameter; the clarification context it yields is the substrate's `InformationStructure`, with
  MAX-QUD as its question and SAL-UTT, a set of at most one sign, as its focus-establishing
  constituents.
* The information state keeps the components that (82) displays: LATEST-MOVE as a sign with its
  assignment, PENDING, MAX-QUD and SAL-UTT; the FACTS update (81) and the grounding conditions
  (80) are not modelled.
* The constituent reading is licensed by categorial parallelism alone, the reformulation without
  utterance anaphora of footnote 55, so that the non-identical fragments of (8) get it; the
  categories of (10) are distinguished by the case or verb form the contrasts turn on.
