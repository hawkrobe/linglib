# Longobardi (2005): Toward a Unified Grammar of Reference

This file formalizes [longobardi-2005], which unifies the syntax of proper names and the
semantics of bare nouns under one mapping theory. Access to N-to-D raising, the derivational
route to object reference, is not bipolar but scalar: pronouns are always in D, proper names
raise whenever D holds no lexical determiner, the names of days and *casa* and the kinship terms
raise only under deixis or a genitive modifier, and ordinary common nouns never raise (25).
Three tests rank the four classes of table (28): object reference in D, use as a predicative
restriction outside D, and kind reference under the definite article, which no proper name has,
*la Maria* being as rigid as *Maria* while *il cane* names a kind (26). Individuals are denoted
in D and arguments denote individuals (52), (53), as constants, with one fixed referential value,
or as variables ranging over a set (54), so an argument is a constant exactly when D holds a
lexically referential expression, a raised noun, a pronoun, a demonstrative or an expletive
article chained to the noun, and is otherwise a variable (55), (56), bound by the operator in D
or unselectively when D is empty (59). A variable must range over a set and objects are not sets,
so only a kind-naming noun restricts one: common nouns need not raise (57a), and by Last Resort
(63) may not, while proper names, object-naming, must raise or take an expletive article, which
answers (57b) and (57c). The article of a name is then obligatorily an expletive, whence the
absence of a kind reading in (26b).

## Implementation notes

The scale of properness is the linear order of the four classes of (28), and each test is a
map into the three-valued scale of access, never, under marked conditions, or always, so that
the paper's "conditioned" cells are values rather than lost. N-to-D raising is the choice of
referential content for an empty D, and Last Resort licenses it exactly when the nominal would
otherwise fail to denote. The *solo* diagnostic of raising, the mass and plural morphology of
kind naming (62), and the type-shifting of names under restrictive modification are not
formalized.

/-- The four classes of nominal head of table (28), from the most prototypically proper-like:
pronouns; proper names, the names of persons and places; the special common nouns, the names of
days and *casa* and the kinship terms, which raise to D only under deixis or a genitive
modifier; and ordinary common nouns. -/
