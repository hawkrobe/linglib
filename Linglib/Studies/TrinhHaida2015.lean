# Trinh and Haida (2015): Constraining the Derivation of Alternatives

This file formalizes the Atomicity constraint of [trinh-haida-2015] and the argument from
symmetry that motivates it. Exhaustification `EXH(A)(S)` negates the innocently excludable
members of a domain `A` of alternatives, (1), the substrate's `exhIE`, and on [fox-katzir-2011]'s
theory `A` is the set of relevant members of the formal alternatives `F(S)`, which, relevance
being closed under negation and conjunction, amounts to the conditions (27): `A ⊆ F(S)`,
`S ∈ A`, and no member of `F(S)` outside `A` lies in the Boolean closure of `A`, `IsDomain`.
Two symmetric alternatives, partitioning the prejacent, are then kept or dropped together
whenever both are formal alternatives, `IsDomain.mem_of_isSymmetric`, so a domain holding one
without the other does not exist, `not_isDomain_pair_of_isSymmetric`, and no inference against
either arises. The puzzle, (20) against (21), is that *Bill went for a run and didn't smoke;
John only went for a run* does license the inference that John smoked, although *run and
smoked* is a formal alternative symmetric to the contextual *run and didn't smoke*, while
*Bill ate exactly three cookies; John only ate three* licenses no inference against *exactly
three*. Atomicity, (32), resolves it: expressions in the substitution source are syntactically
atomic, so once a contextual constituent has been substituted in, its parts cannot be
replaced, (33), and *run and smoked* is not derivable, `Subst` and `atoms_mem_source`. With it
gone, `{run, run ∧ ¬smoke}` satisfies (27) whenever running and smoking are independent among
non-runners, `run_smoke_isDomain`, and exhaustification yields *run and smoked*,
`exhIE_run_smoke`; with *four* derived by lexical replacement and equal to *three* without
*exactly three*, `{three, exactly three}` fails (27), the symmetric case.

## Implementation notes

Sentences are propositions `Set W` and the Boolean closure is mathlib's
`BooleanSubalgebra.closure`; membership in it respects any agreement between worlds on the
generators, `mem_iff_of_mem_closure`, which is how (27c) is refuted or established. The
derivation of alternatives is by substitution alone, as the paper takes [fox-katzir-2011]'s to
be, of a same-category source expression for a non-atomic constituent, and every substituted
expression enters marked atomic, so an alternative differs from the prejacent by whole source
expressions only; the substitution source, the sets `F(S)` of (35) and (42), and the
independence of the predicates are taken from the paper rather than computed from a lexicon.
The constraints (60b) and (60c) for the switching problem, bottom-up and non-weakening
replacement, and the indirect implicature of (54) are described by the rows. The examples are
the rows of `Data.Examples.TrinhHaida2015`.
