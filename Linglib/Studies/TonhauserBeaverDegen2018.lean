# Tonhauser, Beaver and Degen (2018): How Projective Is Projective Content? Gradience in Projectivity and At-Issueness

This file formalizes the Gradient Projection Principle of [tonhauser-beaver-degen-2018], (7):
content expressed by a constituent embedded under an entailment-cancelling operator projects
to the extent that it is not at-issue. Projectivity, the extent to which a listener takes the
speaker of the embedding utterance to be committed to the content, and at-issueness are
gradient properties measured on the unit interval, so the principle is the involution
`Set.Icc.symm`, `gppProjection`, and restricted to binary at-issueness it is the Projection
Principle of [simons-tonhauser-beaver-roberts-2010] and
[beaver-roberts-simons-tonhauser-2017], projects iff not at-issue, `gppProjection_eq_one_iff`.
The analyses of projection the paper reviews predict projection at the ceiling for every
presupposition not under a plug or a filter, [karttunen-1973], [gazdar-1979] and global
accommodation after [heim-1983] and [van-der-sandt-1992], as [potts-2005]'s two-dimensional
analysis does for conventional implicatures: `ceilingProjection`.

The two accounts are run against the observed by-expression means of
`Data.Experiments.TonhauserBeaverDegen2018`. The principle beats the ceiling exactly on
content observed below the midpoint between its not-at-issueness and the ceiling,
`gpp_closer_iff`; on the paper's own worked prediction the content of an NRRC is more
not-at-issue and more projective than the complement of *discover*,
`nrrc_more_projective_than_discover`; the principle is the closer account on every expression
and predicate except the pre-state of *stop*, observed well above its not-at-issueness, where
the ceiling wins, `gpp_closer_than_ceiling` and `ceiling_closer_on_stop`. The direction the
principle predicts for the regressions holds in all four experiments,
`atIssuenessEffect_beta_pos`, and the printed Tukey comparisons divide the contents into more
than two projectivity classes cutting across the hard/soft classification, `three_classes`,
`soft_not_a_class` and `hard_soft_indistinguishable`.

## Implementation notes

* Degrees are `Set.Icc (0 : ℚ) 1`: the observations are printed decimals, read through
  `Decimal.toRat`, and every comparison is exact ℚ arithmetic closed by `decide +kernel`.
* The paper's own test of the principle is the sign and size of the at-issueness effect in
  its regressions, kept as data in `atIssuenessEffect`; the error comparison against the
  ceiling is the paper's review of categorical analyses at the granularity this file can
  check. No theorem re-thresholds a printed p-value.
* `Distinguished` reads the paper's printed Tukey verdicts; what counts as distinguished is
  the paper's mark, not a recomputed test. The paper leaves open whether at-issueness causes
  projection.
