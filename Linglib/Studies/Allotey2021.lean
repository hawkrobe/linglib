# Allotey (2021): overt pronouns of infinitival predicates of Gã

This file formalizes [allotey-2021]. Obligatory control into Gã irrealis
`ni`-clauses requires an overt subject proclitic: null PRO is ungrammatical, a
lexical subject is ungrammatical, and the proclitic shows the whole OC signature
(Table 2). The controlled clause is non-finite and irrealis rather than
subjunctive — it bars tense and aspect, focus fronting and free reference,
licenses NPIs across its boundary, negates preverbally, and carries the irrealis
marker only as a high tone on its subject (Table 4). The pronoun is overt
because that tone needs a segmental host. The subject markers are pronouns,
not agreement: the verb is invariant across subjects (§4.4) and a marker
cannot double a lexical subject (§6.1), against the affixal analysis of
[campbell-2017] that [wals-2013]'s 101A coding of Gã follows; Gã is therefore a
non-pro-drop language (§2.1).

Everything is read off the paper's example rows and the Fragment. The control
profile of a clause type is [landau-2013]'s signature as the rows attest it
(`Control.ofAttested`): no row attests a criterial configuration of the
`ni`-clause, so it is obligatory control, while the finite `akɛ`-clause attests
free reference. Complementizer selection is `Verb.Takes` over the Fragment's
frames; every finiteness diagnostic is a row theorem conditioned on the
complementizer's finiteness alone, the paper's convergence argument; the
subjunctive of ex 105, which `ni` and `akɛ` both head, is the frame that fixes
`ni` as a reality-status typer rather than a coding typer; Table 4 is
the exponents the rows show in each irrealis context, and the tone-hosting
requirement then derives the overt pronoun from the minimal-pronoun inventory.

## Implementation notes

The paper's pro-drop status is its own reading of its 101A cell, obligatory
subject pronouns (§4.2), and is stated here rather than in the Fragment because
[wals-2013] codes the same markers as affixes; `wals_codes_affixes` records
the discrepancy and `no_agreement_rows` the paper's evidence against it. The
bound-variable row of Table 2 rests on the *de se* example (53); the paper
has no *only* test, so `Control.Diagnostic.strictUnderOnly` is never attested
and the bound-variable clause of the signature holds unrefuted rather than
tested. The paper tests reference only in the `ni`- and `akɛ`-clauses, so the
comparison with [landau-2004]'s scale is stated for those two.
