# Distributed Morphology and the pieces of inflection

[halle-marantz-1993]'s English verb inflection: the seven suffixes of their
(8) compete for the fused Tns–Agr node, and the principal parts of their (7)
fall out. Their account of the regular verb's identical finite past and past
participle is underspecification, not a participle rule — `-d` carries only
`[+past]`, and the only participle-specific past item is the stem-listed
`-n`.

## Main definitions

* `Feature`: the fused node's alphabet — binary `[±past]` and
  `[±participle]`, the `[3sg]` agreement complex, and the stem the node is
  inserted next to (the paper's contextual feature).
* `vocabulary`: the items of (8), in the paper's order.
* `tnsAgrFusion`, `tnsAgrSpellout`: Agr, added at MS to `[−participle]` Tns
  nodes, fuses with Tns before insertion.

## Main results

* `principal_parts`: every cell of (7) receives the suffix the paper segments.
* `participle_eq_past_of_not_strong`: the participle/finite-past syncretism of
  every stem outside the `-n` list, by underspecification.
* `zero_morphemes_distinct`: the stem-conditioned past `∅` and the Elsewhere
  `∅` are different Vocabulary Items.
* `agr_only_on_finite`: Fusion refuses a `[+participle]` Tns node.

## Implementation notes

The paper says the ordering among the past block, `[3sg]` `-z`, and
`[+participle]` `-ing` "is not determined by complexity" and "must be
stipulated"; the Subset Principle's count ties at those points, and the
list order of `vocabulary` carries the stipulation
(`past_precedes_agreement`). Stem readjustment (*dwel-t*, *brough-t*) is the
paper's separate rule system and is outside this file.

`[±participle]`, its `[3sg]` person–number complex, and the adjacent stem. -/

  | participle (b : Bool)

disjunctive list in a contextual feature. -/

participle and the finite past receive the same suffix, because every past

`vocabulary` decides — *play-ed*, not *play-s*. -/

/-! ### Fusion in the spell-out pipeline -/

/-- Fusion of adjacent Tns and Agr, then insertion by the Subset Principle. -/

`-z`. -/

carried by the fusion module. -/
