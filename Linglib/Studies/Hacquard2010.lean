# Hacquard (2010): On the Event Relativity of Modal Auxiliaries

This file formalizes [hacquard-2010]'s event-relative semantics for modal auxiliaries. A modal's
modal base is a function of an event rather than a world (29), `must` and `can`, and its event
variable is bound by the closest binder (37), (38): the speech event for a high modal in a matrix
clause, the attitude event for a high modal in a complement, and the VP event for a low modal
(48), the binders of `Modality.ModalPosition`. Speech and attitude events carry propositional
content and embed a proposition under universal quantification over it (41), (44), `attitude`;
the epistemic modal base is the content of the event the modal is anchored to (51),
`Modality.contentNecessity` and `Modality.contentPossibility`, so it is undefined where a low
modal is anchored to a contentless VP event (49e), (59),
`Modality.not_contentPossibility_of_eq_none`, and defined again when the complement is itself an
attitude (60). Anchored to the event that embeds it, an epistemic modal quantifies over the same
worlds as that event, so the outer layer of quantification is vacuous, (53) to (57),
`attitude_can_iff` and `attitude_must_iff`, the possibility case once the information state is
consistent; and Yalcin's supposition (58) is incoherent because the modal quantifies over the
supposition's own content, `not_attitude_suppose`. Cinque's puzzle (section 3) is that
[cinque-1999]'s hierarchy fixes the epistemic head above tense and the root head below aspect,
`CinqueHead`, where a single flavor-neutral entry should suffice; the paper derives the same
matrix correlation from the content of the binding event, `epistemic_high_iff`. The paper's
examples are the rows of `Data.Examples.Hacquard2010`.

## Implementation notes

The content of an event is its set of compatible worlds, `⋂CON(e)`, an `Option` undefined for
contentless events; the descriptive part of an attitude or asserting event, `Exp(e, x)` and
`belief'(e, w)` or `Assert'(e₀, w)`, is an abstract predicate. Ordering sources are omitted, as
in the paper's derivations, and the circumstantial modal base (61), whose event dependence the
paper leaves open, is not defined. The individual and time a modal is keyed to (section 4) enter
only through the binding event; the Italian restructuring evidence belongs to [hacquard-2006].

def flavor : CinqueHead → Option ModalFlavor

/-- The same matrix correlation follows from one flavor-neutral entry (section 6.3). A modal
above tense is bound by the speech event, which has content, and a modal below aspect by the VP
event, which in (59) has none, so an epistemic modal base is available exactly in the high
position. -/
