# Cao, White and Lassiter (2025)

Cao, White and Lassiter treat English *cause*, *make* and *force* as graded causatives. Where
Nadathur and Lauer give *make* a categorical truth condition, causal sufficiency, they measure
three quantities in a structural causal model of tic-tac-toe: Pearl's probability of sufficiency
(`suf`), a simplified version of Halpern and Kleiman-Weiner's degree of intention, and the number
of alternative actions open to the causee. No one quantity determines which verb speakers accept;
each verb has its own set of reliable interactions. As in the model of Cao, Geiger, Kreiss, Icard
and Gerstenberg, the models are time-indexed (`TimeIndex`) and their agents play a
soft-optimality policy.

The paper's in-text judgments, its examples (3)–(11), are rows in
`Data/Examples/CaoWhiteLassiter2025.json`; the regression estimates stay in prose.

## Main definitions

* `softOptimalPolicy`: the move distribution of a player of skill `ρ`
* `altCount`, `intentionDegree`, `modelIntention`: the ALT and INT measures
* `suf`: the SUF measure, Pearl's probability of sufficiency over a causal model
* `TimeIndex`: the paper's time-indexed causal models (definition 1)

## Main results

* `softOptimalPolicy_zero`, `softOptimalPolicy_one`: the infant and the professional
* `intentionDegree_eq_one_of_altCount_eq_zero`: an action with no alternative comes out maximally
  intentional, so the simplified INT drops Frankfurt's alternative-possibilities condition and
  ALT carries it instead
* `suf_dirac`: with a certain context SUF is the {0,1} indicator of the counterfactual outcome
* `suf_eq_one_of_make`: where Nadathur and Lauer's *make* holds, SUF is 1 under every
  distribution over contexts
* `judgment_differs_make_force`: the paper's (8) separates *make* from *force*
* `ProbabilisticExample.suf_eq`: with an uncertain background, SUF is the background's
  probability rather than 0 or 1

/-! ### Soft-optimality policy

The paper's mechanism for agent moves (§2.1.1). The highest-utility move — minimax over the game
tree, with terminal utility `Winner × (EmptySpace + 1)` — is taken with probability `ρ + (1−ρ)/n`
and every other available move with `(1−ρ)/n`, for `n` the number of empty spaces. The skill
parameter interpolates between a uniformly random player ("assume that the players are infants"),
under which the paper's worked SUF contrast between two board states collapses, and a
deterministic professional. -/

/-! ### The ALT measure

ALT (§2.2) counts the alternative actions available to the causee, excluding the one actually
taken — `ALT(Y₁) = 5` at the paper's fig. 2a board state. `ALT = 0` is the Frankfurt-style
could-not-have-done-otherwise configuration. -/

/-! ### The INT measure

The paper's §2.3 displayed equation, a simplified [halpern-kleiman-weiner-2018] degree of
intention:

`INT(a) = Pr(A = a ∧ G) · u′(a) / Σ_{a′} Pr(A = a′ ∧ G) · u′(a′)`

"the probability that an action performed in a state will result in the desired outcome,
normalized by the probability of all alternative actions that would have resulted in the same
outcome", each term weighted by exponentiated utility `u′ = eᵘ`, the exponential serving only to
make the weights strictly positive. Here `pr a′` is the joint probability that the agent takes
`a′` and the goal results, and the weight is abstracted to any `w : A → ℝ≥0`; `modelIntention`
instantiates `pr` over a `SEM`.

The simplification costs the principle it is motivated by: [halpern-kleiman-weiner-2018] hold,
after [frankfurt-1969], that an action an agent could not have avoided is never intentional,
while under this measure such an action is maximally intentional, its sole goal-conducive
alternative being itself. It is ALT rather than INT that registers the paper's *made*/*forced*
contrast in (8). -/

/-! ### Deterministic limit

With a certain context SUF collapses to a {0,1} indicator, and wherever Nadathur and Lauer's
categorical *make* holds of the empty background, SUF is 1 whatever the distribution over
contexts. The converse fails: a single context can make the intervention yield the effect without
the effect being settled by the strict development, so the categorical *make* semantics is
strictly stronger than maximal graded SUF. -/

/-! ### A probabilistic model

SUF is a probability when the background is uncertain. In a model whose `effect` holds when the
`cause` and a background `noise` both do, and whose noise is true with probability `p`, setting
the cause makes the effect true with probability `p`, strictly between the 0 and 1 of the
categorical semantics. -/
