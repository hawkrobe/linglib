# Fedzechkina, Chu and Jaeger (2018): Human information processing shapes language change

Fedzechkina, Chu and Jaeger taught English speakers two miniature languages with free order of
subject and object, one verb-final and one verb-initial, from input in which both orders were
equally frequent and the two arguments always equally long. Describing scenes with one long
argument, verb-final learners put it first and verb-initial learners put it last, the orders
that shorten the verb's dependencies, although English prefers short before long (Arnold,
Wasow, Losongco and Ginstrom); their productions had shorter dependencies than the input.

The paper measures the verb's dependency length as the summed distance in words from the verb to
the closest boundary of each argument: on its sentences, the yield distance of dependency graphs
(`Graph.yieldDist`), and on arrangements of subject, object and verb, the boundary distance of
constituents of given lengths (`Arrangement.boundaryDist`), which agree on Fig. 1 as the
substrate's bridge theorem predicts. The measure is invariant under mirroring, and with the verb
at an edge it is two plus the length of the argument next to the verb. A learner's productions are a probability measure on pairs of the
scene's long argument and the order used. Their mean dependency length is affine in the
probability of the symmetric difference of "the subject is long" and "the subject comes first",
which places every learner in the diamond of Fig. 5 and ties Fig. 5 to the order proportions of
Fig. 4.

## Main statements

* `verbDependencyLength_eq`: the measure on a clause with the verb at an edge.
* `integral_dependencyLength_eq_cond`: the mean dependency length of a verb-final learner is an
  affine function of the difference of the subject-first proportions on the two kinds of scene.
* `abs_integral_dependencyLength_sub_le`: the diamond of Fig. 5.
* `integral_dependencyLength_eq_lower_iff`: who reaches its lower lines.

## Implementation notes

* A short argument is a bare noun, a long one a noun with an adpositional phrase of `L - 1`
  words; `L = 4` in Figs. 1 and 2 and in every number of Fig. 5.
* The measure of Fig. 5 is over the test productions with one long argument, the long subject
  and the long object equally often (`P.fst = uniformOn {.subject, .object}`); the short-short
  baseline is excluded, as in the paper.
* Verb-final learners also used object-first order more often overall, which the paper ascribes
  to the bias to place the case-marked argument first seen in the authors' earlier experiments;
  the overall frequency is a free parameter here.
