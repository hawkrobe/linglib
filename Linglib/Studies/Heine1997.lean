# Heine (1997): Possession

This file formalizes the second chapter of [heine-1997], on the sources of predicative
possession. Possessive constructions derive by grammaticalization from eight event schemas,
propositional templates for everyday situations: *X takes Y*, *Y is located at X*, *X is with
Y*, *X's Y exists*, *Y exists for X*, *Y exists from X*, *as for X, Y exists*, and *Y is X's*.
Each schema is a `Formula` giving its predicate nucleus, which participant it makes the subject,
and how the other participant enters, and the contrastive properties the chapter tabulates
follow from the formulas: only the Action Schema has a lexical nucleus, only Action and
Location are basic rather than extended by an adjunct or modifier, and only Action and
Companion encode the possessor as the subject, the others marking it by an oblique case
(`Schema.possessorCase`). Grammaticalization follows the Overlap Model: a construction carries
the source meaning alone, then both meanings, then the target meaning alone, and
`overlap_of_gradual` derives the middle stage for any development that changes one meaning at
a time and is never meaningless. The rows carry the chapter's examples, the Russian locative
construction at each of the three stages (`russian_stages`), the Telugu division of labour
between the Location Schema for physical possession and the Goal Schema for the permanent and
inalienable notions of `Possession.Notion` (`telugu_notions`), and the Ewe and English cases.

The chapter's survey of source schemas in a hundred languages, the correlations between
schemas and *have* or *belong* constructions, and the probabilistic generalizations about
which notions each schema tends to express stay in prose: Location and Goal are the most
frequent sources and Action a minority one, Location gives *have* constructions and Equation
*belong* constructions, and the Existence schemas are seldom recruited for physical
possession.

## Implementation notes

* The formulas are the chapter's; the classification of nuclei as lexical or schematic and of
  the second participant's entry as core or grafted on are the chapter's criteria, applied
  once to each formula.
* The Source Schema, absent from the chapter's tables, is treated as an Existence schema with
  an ablative possessor.
