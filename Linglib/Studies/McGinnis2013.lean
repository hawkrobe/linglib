# McGinnis (2013): Agree and Fission in Georgian Plurals

McGinnis derives the number suffixes of the Georgian verb from one fused tense–aspect–mood node,
which agrees in number with at most one argument and fissions during Vocabulary Insertion. T's
number probe looks for [Group] first on the subject and then on a first- or second-person object
clitic, and Impoverishment removes the [Group] of a dative first-person plural, whose plurality
then shows only through [Multispeaker] in the prefix *gv-*. Each suffix discharges the features
it spells out, so the third-person plural screeve suffix leaves no [Group] for *-t*, and *-t*
leaves no [#] for the default *-s*.

## Main results

* `rows_realized`: a form of the pool is grammatical iff its prefix and suffixes are those the
  analysis inserts.
* `one_exponent_per_feature`: in every clause the suffixes realize disjoint parts of T's node, so
  there is no double plural marking, which Fission alone would not exclude
  (`fission_alone_allows_double_plural`).
* `setB_realize`, `setA_realize`: the analysis yields the agreement affixes of the Fragment's two
  sets, *gv-* without *-t* included.

## Implementation notes

* An item's contextual features are read off the fused node as it stands before insertion, so
  they are never discharged.
* Only the aorist and optative screeves are modelled, and the null second-person prefix without
  its *x-* allomorph.
* [DAT] is the feature the Set B prefixes spell out, borne by the argument that the Fragment's
  second-series pattern marks by Set B, though that pattern makes the direct object nominative.
