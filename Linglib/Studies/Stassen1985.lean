# Stassen (1985): Comparison and Universal Grammar

This file formalizes Stassen's typology of comparative constructions and his explanation of it
by temporal chaining. A comparative assigns its standard noun phrase derived case, the case of
the comparee, or a fixed case, and a fixed-case standard is the direct object of a verb of
exceeding or an adverbial in a separative, allative or locative case, which gives six types. A
temporal chain is consecutive or simultaneous and is balanced, both predicates keeping their
rank, or deranked, one predicate reduced, either only under identity of subjects or absolutely,
and an absolutely deranked consecutive chain reduces its anterior or its posterior predicate,
which gives the seven syntactic types of chaining. The book's thesis is that a language models
its comparative on one of its chains, and its chaining-based universals follow from the
modelling. Over the fragments, Japanese, Korean, Turkish and Hindi-Urdu have the separative
comparative the book lists them under, Mandarin and Swahili the exceed one, Swahili also a
secondary conjoined one and English the particle one, and the converbs of Korean and Turkish
derank their chains as a separative comparative requires.

## Main definitions

* `Stassen1985.Type1985`, `Stassen1985.type1985`: the six comparative types and the type of a
  construction, read off its anatomy
* `Stassen1985.ChainType`: the seven syntactic types of temporal chaining, with their
  `temporality`, `strategy`, `conditionality` and `direction`
* `Stassen1985.Models`: the chains a comparative type is modelled on
* `Stassen1985.strategy`: the strategy a medial verb form shows

## Main results

* `Stassen1985.toWALS_type1985`, `caseAssignment_type1985`, `spatialCase_type1985`: the type
  agrees with the construction's anatomy and collapses to the type of the atlas
* `Stassen1985.universal1A` to `Stassen1985.universal4`: the chaining-based universals
* `Stassen1985.separative_fragments`, `mandarin_exceed`, `english_particle`,
  `swahili_double_option`: the fragments' constructions under the typology
* `Stassen1985.korean_consistent`, `Stassen1985.turkish_consistent`: the chains a separative
  comparative is modelled on have the strategy the converbs show

## Implementation notes

* The universals are stated over the modelling relation, as the book states them of a
  language that has a comparative of the type, so each says that a chain the type is modelled
  on has the property. The chaining data of the sample that Part Two of the book tests the
  universals against are not transcribed, and the language types of §4.7 under the Principle
  of Parallel Chaining and the procedure-based universals of chapter 15 are not formalized.
* A clause-chaining fragment records the form of a medial verb but neither the conditionality
  of its deranking nor the direction of the reduced predicate, so it yields a strategy and not
  a chain type.
* The mixed comparatives of §2.5, the conjoined exceed comparatives of Fulani, Acholi, Motu,
  Tamazight and Temne, have no type here, and neither has an adverbial standard in no spatial
  case, such as the Finnish partitive or the Swahili *kuliko* the book calls indeterminate.
