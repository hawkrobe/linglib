# Kiparsky (2002): Event Structure and the Perfect

This file formalizes [kiparsky-2002]'s account of the polysemy of the English perfect. The
readings of [1], with the recent past a special case of the resultative, are the possible
assignments of a verbal predicate's event structure to the temporal parameters E, R and P of the
[reichenbach-1947] schema of [2], in which the perfect's E precedes R, [4]: the existential
reading places the event in E, the universal reading makes it coextensive with E, the resultative
reading places the activity of a telic predicate in E and its change of state between E and R
with the result state holding through R, and the present state reading places R in the result
state and leaves the change of state implicit (`PerfectReading.mapping`). Event structure is the
substrate's `TemporalDecomposition`, so the two result-state readings need the complex
decomposition of a telic predicate (`isComplex_of_presentState`).

The three arguments for the polysemy rest on one structural contrast: under the existential and
universal readings the event precedes R (`precedes_of_existential`), under the resultative and
present state readings the result state, and with it the event, extends through R
(`le_runtime_of_presentState`), so no configuration is of both kinds. A subordinate perspective
time anchored to the main-clause event, [16], therefore precedes the main perspective time in the
first case and includes it in the second, which is why [declerck-1991]'s sequence of tense
contrast, [25], separates the existential and universal perfects from the resultative
(`sequenceOfTense_of_existential`, `no_sequenceOfTense_of_resultative`). Adverbs specify R, and
the present perfect's R includes P, so [klein-1992]'s puzzle dissolves: no adverb anterior to P
is possible, while the past perfect's two readings with such an adverb, [33], are the two sides
of the contrast (`present_perfect_puzzle`). And the resultative reading is the only one that
assigns the activity and the result state to different parameters, which is what lets the
activity be presupposed and the change of state asserted, the source of the Wh-puzzle of [39]
(`resultative_distinguishes`).

## Implementation notes

* E, R and P are intervals, [2], and precedence is the strict `NonemptyInterval.precedes`, so
  the event of the universal reading ends before R; the inclusive boundaries remarked on for
  [10] are not represented.
* The anchoring rule [16a] is read at its tightest, the subordinate perspective time being the
  main-clause event's trace.

/-! ### The sequence of tense puzzle, §2 -/

/-- Under the existential and universal readings the main-clause event lies in E, which
precedes R, so a subordinate perspective time anchored to it, [16a], precedes the main one in
the present and past perfects: sequence of tense, [16c], applies, [27]. -/

/-- Under the resultative reading the result state holds through R, which includes P in the
present perfect, so the subordinate perspective time includes the main one and [16c] is
inapplicable, [26]. -/

/-! ### The present perfect puzzle, §3 -/

/-- Adverbs specify R, so an adverb denoting a time anterior to P makes R precede P, which the
present perfect's inclusion of P in R excludes, [12b] and [32a]; the past perfect admits it, and
its two readings with such an adverb, [33], are the existential configuration, the event before
R, and the resultative one, the result state through R. -/

/-- The resultative reading alone assigns the activity and the result state to different
parameters, the activity to E and the result state, holding through R, outside E: the activity
can be presupposed and the change of state asserted, and questioning the activity is questioning
a presupposition, [39]. -/
