# von Fintel (2001): Conditional Strengthening

This file formalizes [von-fintel-2001]'s account of the strengthening of conditionals beyond
their truth conditions. A conditional *if p, q* is a restricted universal over the relevant
situations (5), `Conditional.strictImp`, and the conditional perfection of [geis-zwicky-1971],
*if not p, not q*, is not entailed. The paper argues with [lilje-1972] that perfection does not
arise routinely, but a weaker strengthening does: by the quantity reasoning [gamut-1991]
formalizes as correct use (12), `CorrectUse`, the assertion of *if p, q* competes with the
stronger *q no matter what* (14), universal quantification over antecedents that reduces to
*q* throughout the relevant situations, so the speaker is taken not to believe that *q* holds
unconditionally, an implicature which, against [horn-2000], falls short of perfection. True
perfection arises by the presumption of exhaustivity of [cornulier-1983], the exclusion of
*if p or r, q* for the alternative antecedents `r`: over all alternatives not entailing `p` this
is perfection, over a narrower set only the relativized perfection of (18). What makes the
exclusion required is the exhaustive interpretation of answers of [groenendijk-stokhof-1984]:
a conditional asserted as the answer to *under which conditions does q hold?* is exhaustified
against the answers naming the alternative antecedents (`exhaustifiedAnswer`), which yields a
typology of cases without perfection, among them the yes/no conditional question, whose
answer has no alternative to exclude.

## Implementation notes

Situations are worlds and the relevant situations are given by an accessibility function.
Belief and relevance are predicates on propositions, so an implicature is what every correct
use of the sentence carries, and the step from not believing a proposition to believing its
negation is an explicit opinionatedness hypothesis. The exclusion of the alternative answers
is the innocent-exclusion operator `exhIE`, over alternatives indexed by their antecedents. The
monotonicity condition on scales of [matsumoto-1995] and the semantic exhaustivity of
Groenendijk and Stokhof are not formalized.
