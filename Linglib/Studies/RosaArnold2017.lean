# Rosa and Arnold (2017): Predictability affects production

This file formalizes [rosa-arnold-2017]'s test of whether the predictability of a referent
affects the speaker's choice of a pronoun. Transfer verbs separate thematic role from
grammatical role, since *get* and *take* put the goal in subject position while *give* and
*hand* put it in a nonsubject position, so the design crosses the role of the continued
character with its grammatical role and with the gender contrast of the character pair, and a
rating study finds the goal expected as the next mention well above the source while subjects
are not expected above nonsubjects. The expectancy hypothesis of [arnold-2001] predicts more
pronouns for goals; the topicality account of [kehler-rohde-2013] and
[fukumura-van-gompel-2010] predicts that thematic role leaves the production probability
untouched once grammatical role is fixed. The production probability is a logistic model over
the design, the paper's regression with its two main effects: `topical_iff` states the
topicality account as the vanishing of the thematic effect, and `source_subject_gt_goal_iff`
shows that a subject source pronominalized above a nonsubject goal, the earlier finding taken as
evidence against predictability, is consistent with a positive thematic effect whenever the
subject effect exceeds it. The pronoun rates of the three experiments and the rating study are
`Data/Experiments/RosaArnold2017`; `topical_not_fits` reads the Experiment 1 contrast at fixed
grammatical role and `goal_expected` the rating study. The effect sizes, the marginal
amplification of the goal effect under Occasion and Result continuations in Experiment 2, and
the shorter latencies for goal continuations stay in prose.

## Implementation notes

* A model fits a table of rates when its log-odds order the cells as the rates do, which the
  logistic link guarantees for population rates.
* The gender contrast of an item is derived from the characters' φ-features: a pronoun is
  ambiguous exactly when the two characters agree.
