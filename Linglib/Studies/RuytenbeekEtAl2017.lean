# Ruytenbeek et al. (2017): Indirect request processing, sentence types and illocutionary forces

This file formalizes the paper's test of speech-act literalism, on which a sentence type
encodes an illocutionary force, so that a directive reading of a non-imperative sentence is
secondary, mediated by the encoded force, unless the construction is a conventionalised
indirect request. Non-literalism instead makes a directive reading primary whenever the
sentence shares the semantic features that make imperatives suited to directives: the deontic
necessity of [kaufmann-2012]'s imperative, the questioning of the addressee's ability that is
[clark-1979]'s convention of means, or the enablement the possibility modals encode. The
two accounts are predicates on the constructions of the paper's two French experiments
(`Literalist.DirectivePrimary`, `NonLiteralist.DirectivePrimary`), with conventionalisation
read off the paper's corpus counts and the modal semantics off the French fragment. In both
experiments directive interpretations came with no fixations on the answer buttons and with
response times matching the imperative, and they came for exactly the constructions
non-literalism predicts (`nonLiteralist_predicts`); the non-conventionalised *Est-il possible
de VP?* and the deontic *Vous devez VP* received them although literalism makes those
readings secondary (`literalist_refuted`).

## Implementation notes

The corpus counts, the response-time estimates and the paper's findings on each construction's
interpretations are `Data/Experiments/RuytenbeekEtAl2017`; the stimulus sentences are
`Data/Examples/RuytenbeekEtAl2017.json`. A construction is directive when it received directive
interpretations at all, and unactivated when the paper reports no fixations on the answer buttons
and response times equal to the imperative's for those interpretations; the regression
coefficients stay in prose.
The paper's ranking of directive rates, *Vous devez* above *Vous pouvez* above *Il est
possible*, which it attributes to the permission reading of *pouvoir*, is not derived.

directive force or the construction is a conventionalised indirect request; any other
directive reading is secondary and activates the encoded force. -/

/-- Literalism is refuted on both of the paper's predictions. The non-conventionalised

question, which the paper reads as interference from its entrenched directive use. -/
