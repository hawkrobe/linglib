# Heim (1994): Interrogative Semantics and Karttunen's Semantics for *know*

This file formalizes [heim-1994]. A [karttunen-1977] intension assigns each world a set of
true answers; `IsKarttunen` is the property that every member of the answer set at `w` holds
at `w`, true of the substrate's Karttunen denotation (`isKarttunen_trueAnswers`). Karttunen's
simplified entry for *know* (4) has the agent believe the answer in Heim's first sense (15),
the intersection of the true answers; his actual entry (5) adds that an empty answer set be
believed empty; and the generalized entry (9) has the agent believe that the answer set is
what it is, which makes the first clause redundant
(`Karttunen.simplifiedKnow_of_generalizedKnow`). Believing the answer set to be what it is is
believing the cell of the kernel of the intension (`generalizedKnow_iff_know_ker`), so the
generalized analysis is [groenendijk-stokhof-1982]'s entry (14) on the kernel question; for
*whether*-questions all four entries coincide (`knows_whether_tfae`).

The comparison for constituent questions rests on one observation: the which-intension (3)
is the image of the extension of *student who called* under the propositional concept `C`,
while Groenendijk and Stokhof's (13) is the kernel of the extension map, so the two agree
exactly when `C` is injective — the paper's premise that no two individuals call in exactly
the same possible worlds (`ker_which`). The two divergences of §7 are the two ways
injectivity fails: identity with oneself (21) is constant, reducing the generalized analysis
to knowing whether there are students (`Karttunen.ker_which_identicalWithSelf`), and living
with one's actual spouse (24) identifies Bill with Sue (`Spouses`). Structured propositions
(27) restore the agreement for every predicate, since tagging each individual with the
property is injective outright (`ker_whichStructured`), while the unstructured answers stay
recoverable (`Karttunen.which_eq_image_whichStructured`) though not conversely
(`Spouses.whichStructured_ne`). The answer in the second sense (16) entails the answer in
the first (`ans₂_subset_ans₁`), and on a Hamblin set it is the substrate's strongly
exhaustive answer (`ans₂_trueAnswers`).

## Implementation notes

Belief is `w ∈ (Dox x).core p` over doxastic alternatives `Dox : E → SetRel W W`, with no
frame conditions, as the paper assumes none. Groenendijk and Stokhof's entries (13) and (14) are
`GroenendijkStokhof1984.whichDeDicto` and `GroenendijkStokhof1984.Knows`, their 1982 paper
being chapter II of the dissertation. Predicates are topical properties `E → Set W`,
the substrate's `trueAnswers_range` shape, so the restrictorless *who called* (6) is the
Karttunen denotation of `Set.range C` (`Karttunen.which_univ`) and the superset argument of
§3 is `Karttunen.which_mono`. `E` ranges over individuals, not the groups of the paper's
footnote on plurals. `identicalWithSelf` is the universally necessary property, which every
individual has in every world. The scenarios are the paper's own two-world models: in
`Spouses` the worlds record whether Sue is a student and whether the couples live together,
and John holds the single false belief that Sue is not a student (§7). The ambiguity of
*answer* in (17)–(20) is a row. The Feynman sentence of §4's footnote is not modelled; the
general negation case is `George2011`.

## TODO

* §6 identifies the proposition of (9) with the answer in the second sense (16), but in
  general only `Setoid.ker q ≤ Setoid.ker (ans₁ q)` holds (`ker_le_ker_ans₁`): on identity
  with oneself, `ans₂` is trivial while the kernel of the intension asks whether there are
  students.
