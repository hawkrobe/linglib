# Rappaport Hovav and Levin (2024): Variable agentivity: polysemy or underspecification?

This file formalizes the paper's account of the English verb *sweep*, whose subject may or may
not be an agent. The verb has two senses. In the basic sense its event structure says only
that an entity moves across a surface while imparting a force to it through contact; either
predicate may determine argument realization, general principles then yield the simple
transitive, transitive+PP and unaccusative+PP frames, and agentivity is left to pragmatic
inference. In the broom sense the moving entity is lexically saturated by a broom, an
instrument: since only an agent manipulates an instrument the sense is obligatorily agentive,
since the saturated variable cannot head a small clause the motion predicate cannot determine
argument realization, and since sweeping with a broom is a routine activity the surface may go
unexpressed.

Participants are classified by the source of their energy, `EnergySource`: a moving entity
that draws its energy from a user needs an expressed agent, which excludes *the brush swept
through her hair* while admitting *fire swept through their home*. `Licensed` derives from
the realization principles the surface frames an event admits, and
`acceptable_iff_licensed` checks the paper's judgments, those for *rub* and *scrape* included,
against it. A non-agentive subject in the simple transitive frame comes with no small clause,
against the resultative restriction.

## Implementation notes

The cause of the causativized event structure and the agent whose instrument or body part sits
in a *with* phrase are one participant, the causer. Interpretive properties the paper derives
from the conceptual content of *broom* (a floor-like surface, the removal of unwanted material,
the *with* phrase naming a broom), the resultatives, the *again* readings and the relaxation
under which a contextually recoverable agent goes unexpressed are outside the model, and their
rows are omitted. The causativized event structure has no result state, so it is not the
accomplishment of `ArgumentStructure.EventStructure.Template`.

moving entity and whose predicate is the path, the surface being the object of the path's
preposition if expressed; a saturated moving entity is unavailable for syntactic expression,
so the motion predicate cannot determine realization. A force recipient is an internal
argument, omissible only for a routine activity. A self-energetic force bearer is an effector
and hence external; one that draws its energy from the causer sits in a *with* phrase,
optionally when the sense lexicalizes it. -/
