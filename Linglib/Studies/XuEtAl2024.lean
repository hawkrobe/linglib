# Xu, Kemp, Frermann & Xu (2024): Word Reuse and Combination Support Efficient Communication

This file formalizes the efficient-communication account of lexicalization in [xu-etal-2024].
A novel concept enters the lexicon by reusing an existing form or by combining existing forms
into a compound, and both strategies are shaped by a tradeoff between speaker effort, the
expected length of the form, and information loss, the expected surprisal of the intended
concept under the listener's distribution (`costs`). The speaker produces from the expanded
lexicon while the listener, who has not yet acquired the new pairs, interprets each form as
the label of a category with a prototype, assigning concepts probability by a similarity
choice rule (`listener`), the softmax of the negative distances to the prototype
(`real_listener`), so that under a form a concept closer to the prototype is less surprising
and incurs less information loss (`surprisal_listener_le`).
The combined objective weights the two costs by a tradeoff parameter and, with need held
fixed, decomposes into an item-level objective, so an encoding that is optimal concept by
concept is optimal overall (`weightedCost_costs`, `weightedCost_le_of_forall`). Along the
frontier the optimal encodings trade length for informativeness as the parameter grows
(`Pragmatics.Efficiency.frontier_antitone`), and a compound is longer than the constituent it
reuses (`length_compound`), the length half of the tradeoff the paper reports between the two
strategies. An item is literal when the intended concept is a hyponym of an existing sense of
the reused form or of the compound's head (`Literal`).

## Implementation notes

The speaker's distribution is a point mass on the intended concept, so the expected
Kullback–Leibler divergence of the paper is the expected surprisal. Need probabilities and
the production policy enter through one weight per concept over a deterministic encoding, the
case under which the paper computes its frontier. The corpus results, the fitted sensitivity
parameter, the sentence-encoder prototypes, and the baseline encodings are not restated; the
attested items of the paper's first table and the near-synonyms of its second are recorded
as examples. Surprisal is measured in nats; bits differ by the factor `log 2`, which rescales
the tradeoff parameter.
