# Chierchia 2004: parallel recursive strengthening

[chierchia-2004] ("Scalar Implicatures, Polarity Phenomena, and the
Syntax/Pragmatics Interface", §3) computes two meanings for every expression in
tandem: a plain value `‖α‖` and a strengthened value `‖α‖^S` that folds scalar
implicatures in as soon as their triggers appear. Direct implicatures enter at
scope sites by a variant of [krifka-1995a]'s rule (75); the Strength Condition
(§3.1) requires `‖α‖^S` to entail `‖α‖` at every step; and Strong Application
(84) dispatches on entailment behaviour: non-DE functions pass strengthened
values through, DE functions strip the argument's implicatures and add indirect
implicatures at the matrix level. Implicature suspension in exactly the
*any*-licensing environments — the Generalization on SIs (53) — is `Antitone`
reversal of the Strength Condition, and intervention (§4.3) follows from NPIs
competing with strong rather than plain meanings (127).

## Implementation notes

Numbered items follow the circulated manuscript (the "Bicocca, May 2001"
version); the published chapter may renumber. The paper's scalar assertion `σ`
is a definite description — *the* weakest alternative asymmetrically entailing
the target, ⊥ if none — well-defined only when the stronger alternatives have a
greatest element, as on the paper's linearly ordered scales. `Meaning.strengthen`
and `strongApplyDE` instead negate *all* strictly stronger alternatives, a total
operation that coincides with negating `σ` exactly where `σ` is defined
(`strengthen_strong_eq_of_isGreatest`, `strongApplyDE_strong_eq_of_isGreatest`;
the `σ = ⊥` case is the empty intersection). The
appendix's `‖α‖^S` is a *set* of admissible strong meanings (implicature
addition at a scope site is optional); `Meaning.strong` tracks the maximal
admissible strengthening, the path the paper's own computations follow.
