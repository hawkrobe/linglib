# Qing et al. (2025): When Can Non-Veridical Preferential Attitude Predicates Take Questions?

Qing, Özyıldız, Roelofsen, Romero and Uegaki classify non-veridical preferential predicates by
clausal distributivity and evaluative valence. Uegaki and Sudo derive the anti-rogativity of
*hope* from two assumptions, that the predicate is clausally distributive and that it presupposes
Threshold Significance. Neither holds in general: *worry* and Mandarin *qidai* relate the agent
to the question rather than to an answer, and negative predicates such as *fear* lack the
presupposition. Composition with a question is therefore trivial, and the predicate
anti-rogative, exactly for the distributive positive class. Apparent uses of *hope* with a polar
question are non-canonical, and the asymmetry between hoping for the radical and for its negation
follows from the goals of a hopeful wondering.

## Main statements

* `relational_not_isDistributive`: a predicate related to a question but to none of its answers
  is not clausally distributive.
* `trivial_iff_class`: composition with a question is trivial exactly for the distributive
  positive class.
* `responsive_rows`, `anti_rogative_rows`, `tsp_rows`, `nondistributive_rows`: the paper's
  judgments in five languages.
* `hopes_radical`, `hopes_negation`: hoping for the radical licenses the wondering and hoping for
  its negation does not.

## Implementation notes

Triviality quantifies over the degree function and threshold, the non-logical constants of
Gajewski's analyticity, with the question as its own comparison class, and the concrete models
measure preference in the reals. A relational predicate is a parameter relating the agent to the
question, since the paper characterizes the class only as a relation to the question not reducible
to one to any answer. The class of a predicate is read off the valence and distributivity its
lexical entry records. The paper contrasts positive with negative predicates; a neutral one is taken
to lack threshold significance, as a negative one does. The pragmatic derivation compares coming to
believe the radical or not by Kratzer's ordering with the event's goals as ordering source; the
event summation of the adjunction analysis is not formalized. The Spanish predicates without a
Fragment entry, *temer* and *preocupar*, are classified here. Rows carry the paper's truth values
where it gives them and its felicity judgments otherwise; the attested *hope whether* examples are
recorded as marginal, and *temer* with a polar question and *haipa* with a constituent question are
recorded but not predicted.

/-- Composition of a predicate family with a question is trivial under a presupposition when in
