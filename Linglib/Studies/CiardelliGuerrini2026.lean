# Ciardelli and Guerrini (2026): Against wide scope free choice

This file formalizes the reductionist thesis of [ciardelli-guerrini-2026]: the free-choice
reading of *you may A or you may B* arises from the narrow-scope LF ◇(A ∨ B), the reading of
the wide-scope ◇A ∨ ◇B being the ignorance one ([fusco-2019]). Possibility distributes over
disjunction, so the two LFs coincide in truth conditions there, and the ambiguity shows where
they differ: *you must A or you must B* has a reading as one disjunctive obligation □(A ∨ B),
strictly weaker than □A ∨ □B, and *you may A and you may B* one as a conjunctive permission
◇(A ∧ B), strictly stronger than ◇A ∧ ◇B. The narrow LF arises by modal concord
([zeijlstra-2007]): a modal auxiliary carries an uninterpretable modal feature, and one silent
interpretable operator above the coordination checks both auxiliaries' features when they fall
in one concord class. Non-auxiliary modals carry interpretable features and cannot be checked,
which is why *it's ok for John to sing or it's ok for John to dance* has no free choice
([meyer-sauerland-2017]), while *may* and *can* share their feature and mix
([alonso-ovalle-2006]). Across negation concord needs dual forces ([grosz-2010],
[anand-brasoveanu-2010]), negation flipping the force of the feature it scopes over, so *I need
not cook and I need not clean* conveys a permission to do neither and not an obligation. The
modal features come from the English auxiliary Fragment, and the paper's coordination and
concord examples are rows.

## Implementation notes

The argument against across-the-board movement from *everyone sang or everyone danced*
([simons-2005]) has no movement substrate here, and the cases the paper leaves open, *it is
possible that A or it is possible that B* and conjoined *be allowed*, are not rows.

/-! ### Modal features ([zeijlstra-2007]) -/

/-- A modal feature is interpretable, contributing a modal operator, or uninterpretable,
checked by an interpretable feature that c-commands it. -/

/-- A modal feature pairs a force with its interpretability: the four features `[i∀-MOD]`,
`[u∀-MOD]`, `[i∃-MOD]` and `[u∃-MOD]`. -/

def ModalFeature.negated (f : ModalFeature) : ModalFeature := ⟨f.force.dual, f.interp⟩

/-- Concord across negation succeeds exactly between the two classes: an interpretable feature
checks a negated uninterpretable one iff their forces fall in different classes. -/

/-! ### Modal concord (§3) -/

/-- Two modal features stand in concord when both are uninterpretable and fall in one concord
class: one silent interpretable operator above the coordination then checks both, (15), so the
modal outscopes the coordinator. -/
def Concord (f₁ f₂ : ModalFeature) : Prop :=

/-! ### Concord across negation (§4.2) -/

/-- (28), *I need not cook and I need not clean*: the negated feature of *need* is checked by a
silent possibility operator, (29a), and not by a necessity one, (29c), so the sentence conveys
a permission to do neither and not an obligation to do neither. -/
