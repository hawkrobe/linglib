# Haslinger, Hien, Rosina, Schmitt and Wurm (2025): A unified semantics for universal quantifiers

This file formalizes the single universal quantifier of Haslinger, Hien, Rosina, Schmitt and
Wurm and the two presuppositional heads it combines with. The quantifier `Q∀` applies its scope
to every element of its restrictor that contains each restrictor element it overlaps. Whether the
result distributes falls out of the restrictor's part structure. A restrictor of pairwise
non-overlapping elements, such as the denotation of a singular count noun, makes `Q∀` the
ordinary universal quantifier, and a sum-closed plural restrictor with a largest element makes it
a claim about that largest sum. This is the authors' Distributivity–Number Generalization, which
strengthens the implicational universal of Gil. In two-form languages such as English and German
a head ONE below the quantifier presupposes that the restrictor has more than one element and
either is pairwise non-overlapping (English *every*) or consists of atoms (*each*, German
*jeder*), following Fassi Fehri. The heads are partial identities on restrictors, so a
presupposition failure is undefinedness rather than falsity.

## Main definitions

* `MaxNonOverlap`, `QForall`: the quantifier's domain condition and the quantifier `Q∀`.
* `oneEmpty`, `oneAt`: the heads ONE_∅ and ONE_AT as partial functions on restrictors.
* `over`, `every`, `each`, `jeder`: the quantifier over a head, and the English and German
  structures as partial propositions.

## Main results

* `qForall_iff_of_disjoint`, `qForall_iff_of_supClosed`: the two halves of the generalization.
* `each_le_every`: *each* is defined on fewer restrictors than *every* and agrees where both are.
* `dng`, `qForall_twoStudents`: the generalization on one algebra of students, and the vacuity
  of `Q∀` over *two students* when three students are salient.
* `every_tenMinutes_dom`, `each_tenMinutes_undefined`: consecutive ten-minute intervals meet the
  presupposition of *every* and fail that of *each*.
* `one_iff_singular`: the English forms carrying a ONE head are the ones the fragment records as
  selecting the singular.
* `judgment_rows`: the paper's *ten minutes* judgments are the definedness predictions.

## Implementation notes

The null individual is `IsBot`, the overlap relation `Mereology.Overlap`, and non-overlap of a
restrictor `Mereology.DisjointPred`. The heads are `PFun.res` of the identity on the
restrictors meeting their presupposition, and a structure applied to a restrictor and a scope is
a `Part Prop`, defined when the head is. Time is measured in minutes, so *ten minutes* denotes the
consecutive half-open intervals of `ℕ`. The survey of universal quantifiers in the paper's first
two tables is not formalized here, since a survey of lexemes has no data format in the library.
