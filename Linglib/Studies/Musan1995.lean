# Musan (1995): On the Temporal Interpretation of Noun Phrases

Musan's dissertation accounts pragmatically for life-time effects in its second chapter. Out
of the blue, *Gregory was from America* suggests that Gregory is dead
while *Gregory was silent* does not. Tenses quantify existentially over times, every
predicate carries a life-time presupposition that its argument exists at the predication
time (`holdsAt`), and an individual-level predicate holds of an individual at every time of
its life if at any (`IndividualLevel`). The present-tense sentence is then more informative
than the past-tense one, entailing it without being entailed by it (`present_entails_past`,
`past_not_entails_present`), so a speaker choosing the past tense implicates that the
property is over, and for an individual-level predicate that is to implicate that the
individual no longer exists (`lifetime_effect`); a stage-level predicate supports the first
implicature but not the second (`no_lifetime_effect_of_stage_level`).

## Implementation notes

Times are the points of a linear order, the past tense is the quantificational past of
`Semantics/Tense/Quantificational.lean`, and the present tense is evaluation at the utterance
time, where the dissertation quantifies over intervals surrounding it. The neutralization of
life-time effects in temporally specific contexts, the existence-independent predicates, and
the third chapter's account of the predication times of noun phrases are not represented.
