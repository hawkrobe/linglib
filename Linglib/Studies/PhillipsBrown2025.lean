# Phillips-Brown (2025): Some-Things-Considered Desire

Phillips-Brown gives a question-based semantics for desire ascriptions. Conflicting ascriptions,
*you want to take a nap* and *you don't want to take a nap* both true, falsify the belief-based
semantics of Heim and von Fintel, which evaluate the agent's preferences over her whole belief set
with no context sensitivity, and a context-sensitive preference relation that values whole worlds
overgenerates, predicting *you want to fail the exam* wherever *Nap* is true. The proposal
evaluates an ascription against a contextual question, a partition of the worlds: the answers
compatible with the beliefs are ranked by the desires they entail, *S wants p* holds when every
best answer entails *p* (`Want`), and the ascription is defined only if the question decides *p*,
is diverse, does not stack the deck, and the beliefs are sensitive to it (`Defined`).

## Main results

* `vonFintel_no_conflict`, `heim_no_conflict`: the belief-based semantics cannot make *Nap* and
  *Not-nap* both true.
* `closure_under_doxastic_equivalence`, `cpr_overgenerates`: on a belief-based semantics wanting
  the act is wanting its believed cost, Villalta's closure under doxastic equivalence.
* `act_true`, `not_act_true`, `cost_undefined`: *Nap* and *Not-nap* are each true in their own
  context, and *Fail* is undefined in the first.
* `not_rain_deckstacked`, `deckstacked_excluded`: the deck-stacked question of Lu's case is
  excluded by the anti-deckstacking constraint, which the level playing field satisfies.
* `undefined_of_insensitive`, `toPartialProp_strawsonEntails`: an agent whose beliefs are
  insensitive to every question deciding *p* has *S wants p* undefined, which leaves the semantics
  Strawson upward monotone.
* `want_bot_iff`: on the finest question the semantics is the best-worlds one,
  `Desire.BestWorlds.Want`.

## Implementation notes

* A question is a `Setoid`, its answers the cells; the question raised by a list of issues is
  their `Setoid.ofProps`, and *p* is considered relative to a question when the question
  decides it. Answers are ordered by the desires they entail, [kratzer-1981]'s ordering with
  entailment as satisfaction (`entailed`), and the best answers are the `MaximalFor` elements
  of that valuation.
* The act, its benefit and its cost are the three issues of the nap and lobster cases (nap,
  feeling rested, failing the exam; eating the lobster, the gustatory experience, dying), the
  beliefs tying benefit and cost to the act, and the desires being the benefit and not the
  cost. The Anti-deckstacking Constraint quantifies over all propositions; read so, it admits
  only the finest partition (`antiDeckstacking_univ_singleton`), so it is restricted here to a
  list of salient propositions, the issues of each case.
* Heim's semantics is the conditional one, `Desire.Conditional.Want`. Levinson's expected-value
  comparison, the sufficient-desirability semantics of §2.4, and the Heimian question-based
  semantics of footnote 16 are prose.
