# Heim and Kratzer (1998): Semantics in Generative Grammar

This file formalizes the treatment of quantifiers in Chapter 7 of [heim-kratzer-1998]: a
quantificational DP in object position creates a type mismatch (§7.1) that Quantifier
Raising repairs by movement (§7.3), leaving a trace interpreted by the Traces and Pronouns
Rule (Ch. 5 (9)) and a binder index interpreted by Predicate Abstraction (§5.2.3, as revised
in Chapter 7), so that the raised quantifier takes the abstracted predicate as its scope.
The substrate's composition engine implements those rules; here it is fed QR trees whose
quantifier leaves are the English fragment's words, read through the terminals of their
available readings, and whose other leaves are the toy fragment's, and its output is checked:
"every student sleeps" and "some student sleeps"
compose to the expected truth conditions, and the two QR derivations of a doubly
quantified sentence, the book's (2) "Some publisher offended every linguist", compute the
two scope readings of `Quantifier.Polyadic`, which differ in the toy model
(`scope_ambiguity_computed`) and are nested (`inverse_entails_surface`). The trees also
compile to first-order formulas, so the engine's truth conditions are model-theoretic
realization (`interp_eq_realize`) and first-order consequence transfers
(`conj_entails_first`). The words' available readings compose as sets through
`Tree.readings`, and the surface-scope reading is among the readings of the surface tree. It
is also among the readings of the flat tree under the book's in-situ alternative, whose
lexical rule adds the object-position entries to the quantifier words' readings. The book's
composition principles are also transcribed as reference relations, the extensional rules of
Chapters 3 to 5 (`Denotes`) and their revision for partial denotations in Chapter 4
(`Partial.Denotes`), which the engines extend, and Chapter 4's Fregean definite article makes
*the student* a presupposition failure and *the pizza* a defined value in the toy model.

## Implementation notes

The toy fragment's "every person sees some person" stands in for the book's (2); the
readings are the surface and inverse iterations of `Quantifier.Polyadic`. With
`interpTy .t = Prop` the engine produces `Prop`-valued truth conditions, verified at the
`Prop` level rather than by evaluation. The categorised tree `synTree_everyStudentSleeps`
carries UD categories that the engine ignores.

/-! ### The engine computes the readings

The QR trees and the readings `surfaceScopeProp`/`inverseScopeProp` are linked by
`interp`: running the engine on a tree yields exactly the corresponding reading. So the
scope-ambiguity result is a fact about the *engine's* output, not a parallel
re-implementation alongside it. -/

/-! ### Unified tree: the same sentence with UD categories

on every node. `interp` ignores the categories and produces identical
truth conditions to the category-free `Tree Unit String` version. -/

     .bind 1 .S
       (.node .S (.trace 1 .NP :: .node .VP (.terminal .V "sleeps" :: []) :: [])) :: [])

/-! ### Readings of the ambiguous lexicon

The fragment's words make sets of readings available, and `Tree.readings` composes them, each
occurrence resolved to one reading. The study's leaf interpretation is one choice among them,
so the surface-scope reading is among the readings of the surface tree. -/

  Tree.interp_mem_readings lex_mem_lexReadings interp_computes_surface

end Readings

/-! ### Repairing the mismatch in situ

Section 7.2.1's alternative to movement leaves the object quantifier in place and lets the
quantifier words be multiply ambiguous. The object-position entry takes a two-place predicate
and the subject and quantifies over the object, and the book's lexical rule derives it for
every determiner from its basic entry of the determiner type (`Denotation.objectShift?`), so
the words' readings grow by their object-position entries. The book's subscripts are a
resolution of the flat tree, the basic entry in subject position and the object-position entry
in object position, and under it the tree composes by Functional Application alone to the
surface-scope reading, which is therefore among the readings of the flat tree. A resolution
putting an object-position entry in subject position, or a basic entry in object position, is
uninterpretable, so the syntax need not say where each entry may occur. -/

object-position entry available beside its basic one. -/

/-! ### The book's rules as a reference

[heim-kratzer-1998]'s composition principles for the extensional fragment, transcribed as an
interpretation relation with one constructor per rule: Terminal Nodes, Non-Branching Nodes,
Functional Application with either daughter the function, Predicate Modification, the Traces
and Pronouns Rule, and Predicate Abstraction, which asks the body to denote under every
modification of the assignment. The engine at `M = Id` extends the relation
(`interp_of_denotes`): where the book assigns a denotation, the engine computes it, and the
engine also interprets the event-identification configurations the book leaves undefined. The
relation is therefore functional (`Denotes.unique`), and the surface-scope reading is a
derivation in the book's own rules (`denotes_surface`). -/

/-! ### The definite article and partiality

The book's Fregean entry for the definite article is `Partial.the`, and the partial engine
`Partial.interp` composes it with the toy fragment's predicates lifted to partial functions.
The toy model has two students and one pizza, so *the student* is a presupposition failure in
the sense of §4.4.4, a denotation that is undefined, while *the pizza* denotes the pizza, and
*the John*, the article applied to an individual, is uninterpretable, which the types alone
decide. -/

/-! ### The book's partial rules as a reference

Chapter 4 revises the composition principles for partial denotations. A branching node is in
the domain of the interpretation function when both daughters are and, for Functional
Application, the function's domain contains the argument. `Partial.Denotes` transcribes the revised
rules with semantic values in `Part`, so that a node the rules assign an undefined value is a
node outside the domain of the interpretation function, and its premises ask the daughters to
have defined values as the book's rules do. The partial engine extends the relation
(`Partial.interp_of_denotes`), so *the pizza* is a derivation in the book's own rules and *the
student* has no defined value under them. The lifted toy lexicon, whose entries are all first
order, never fails. -/
