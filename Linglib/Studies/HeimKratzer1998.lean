# [heim-kratzer-1998]: Type-Driven Composition of Quantifiers

End-to-end verification that the H&K engine (`Composition/Tree.lean`)
composes quantificational sentences as advertised in Ch. 5: lexicon →
QR-syntax tree (with traces and binders) → truth conditions. The engine
implements TN/NN/FA/IFA/PM/PA; this file feeds it the textbook examples
and checks the predictions over a toy model.

## H&K Pipeline (Ch. 5)

After Quantifier Raising moves a DP to a higher position, it leaves a
trace `tₙ` and creates a binder node `n`. Predicate Abstraction (PA)
converts the binder + body into `λx. ⟦body⟧^{g[n↦x]}`, producing a
predicate that the raised quantifier takes as its scope argument.

"Every student sleeps" after QR:
```
[S [DP [D every] [N student]] [1 [S [t₁] [VP sleeps]]]]
```

Evaluated as:
1. `⟦t₁⟧^g = g(1)` (Traces rule)
2. `⟦sleeps⟧ = sleeps'` (TN)
3. `⟦[t₁ sleeps]⟧^g = sleeps'(g(1))` (FA)
4. `⟦[1 [t₁ sleeps]]⟧^g = λx. sleeps'(x)` (PA)
5. `⟦every student⟧ = every'(student')` (FA)
6. `⟦S⟧ = every'(student')(λx. sleeps'(x))` (FA)

## Scope ambiguity

"Everybody loves somebody" yields two readings from two QR structures —
surface scope (∀>∃) and inverse scope (∃>∀) — that differ only in which
quantifier is raised higher. `scope_readings_differ` certifies that the
two trees compute genuinely distinct propositions in the toy model.

## Note on `Prop`-valued `.t`

With `interpTy .t = Prop`, the engine produces `Prop`-valued truth
conditions directly. Theorems verify these at the `Prop` level rather
than via `evalTree` (which would demand a blanket
`Decidable (∀ p : Prop, p)` instance).

Two QR structures yield two scope readings. The trees differ only in
which quantifier occupies the higher position. -/

/-! ### The engine computes the readings

The QR trees and the hand-written `surfaceScopeProp`/`inverseScopeProp` are linked
by `interp`: running the engine on a tree yields exactly the corresponding reading.
So the scope-ambiguity result is a fact about the *engine's* output, not a parallel
re-implementation alongside it. -/

/-- Surface scope: the engine computes the hand-written reading. -/
theorem interp_computes_surface :
    interp ToyEntity Unit quantLex g₀ tree_surface = some ⟨Ty.t, surfaceScopeProp⟩ := rfl

/-- Inverse scope: likewise. -/

  exact scope_readings_differ this

/-! ### Unified tree: the same sentence with UD categories

The QR tree as `Tree Cat String` — carrying real UD-grounded categories
on every node. `interp` ignores the categories and produces identical
truth conditions to the category-free `Tree Unit String` version. -/

/-- QR tree with UD categories:
`[S [DP [Det every] [N student]] [1 [S [t₁:NP] [VP sleeps]]]]` -/
def synTree_everyStudentSleeps : Tree Cat String :=
  .node .S
    (.node .DP (.terminal .Det "every" :: .terminal .N "student" :: []) ::
     .bind 1 .S
       (.node .S (.trace 1 .NP :: .node .VP (.terminal .V "sleeps" :: []) :: [])) :: [])

/-! ### First-order reduction

The textbook trees are in the compiled FO fragment
(`Composition/Reduction.lean`): they compile to mathlib
`FirstOrder.Language.Formula`s, and by the agreement theorem the engine's
truth conditions *are* model-theoretic realization over `toyModel`. -/
