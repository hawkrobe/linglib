# Schwa variation in Tarifit CCəC words

Tarifit triconsonantal verbs in the simple imperative carry a prosodic-template schwa between
the second and third root consonants, and Afkir and Zellou find two further phonetic variants:
a shorter, coarticulating intrusive schwa inside the initial cluster ([Cə̆CəC], about a quarter of
productions), and vowelless forms ([CCC], about five percent), neither of them sensitive to
speaking style. The two schwas are independent processes, the template schwa a targeted segment
whose deletion shortens the word and the intrusive schwa a targetless vocoid. Their distribution
over the thirty-eight target words is tabulated by word. The words are the fragment's roots
vocalized by the simple-imperative template CCəC (`imperative`, `surface`), and this file states
the tables' generalizations over the pooled rows (`root?`, `intrusion?`, `vowelless?`), with each
root's initial-cluster sonority profile read off its phones (`Rising`, `Falling`).

Two hypotheses about the intrusive schwa are set against each other: repair, on which
insertion should be most frequent in the dispreferred falling-sonority clusters, and the
syllable-planning account of Georgian, on which a vocoid is tolerated only where it boosts the
planned sonority peak, hence in rising clusters. The data side with the second: every rising
cluster shows intrusion at least variably unless its second consonant is voiceless
(`intrusion_of_rising`), the words that never or rarely show intrusion are non-rising or have a
voiceless second consonant (`nonRising_or_voiceless_of_never_rarely`), and the paper's three
flagged exceptions are the only non-rising words with a voiceless second consonant that vary
(`variably_exceptions`). The near-categorical class is exactly the words with medial /r/
(`almostExclusively_iff_c2_r`); it is not the rising class, since on the paper's scale the
pharyngeal outranks the tap and /ʕrəm/ falls.
Vowellessness tracks low sonority: the often-vowelless words have voiceless second and third
consonants, except the flagged /ħkəm/ (`voiceless_of_often_vowelless`), and the never-vowelless
words all carry a voiced consonant there (`voiced_of_never_vowelless`). The regression
estimates, the acoustic measurements, and the perception result that an intrusive vowel aids
discrimination only in falling clusters are reported in the paper without a formal counterpart
here.
