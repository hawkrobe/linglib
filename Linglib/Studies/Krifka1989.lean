# Krifka (1989): Nominal Reference, Temporal Constitution and Quantification in Event Semantics

Krifka relates the reference of nominal predicates to the temporal constitution of verbal
predicates. Objects, events and times form join semilattices, and a predicate is cumulative when
it is closed under join and quantized when no instance is a proper part of another. Measure
phrases and count nouns are quantized because their measure functions are extensive. A thematic
relation transfers the reference type of its nominal argument to the verbal predicate:
summativity carries cumulativity across, and uniqueness and mapping properties carry quantization
across when the relation is not iterative.

## Implementation notes

The paper's relations are stated with the library's object-first thematic relations, so its
uniqueness of objects is `UP`, uniqueness of events `GUE`, mapping to objects `MO`, mapping to
events `ME`, and summativity `SUM`. Its part structures satisfy relative complementarity (D 9),
which the measure theorems assume as `Mereology.HasRemainders`. Theorem (T 3) needs a nonempty
predicate, since the empty predicate is both quantized and strictly cumulative. The proof of
(T 13) shows that every verbal event has a part outside the predicate; its conclusion that the
event contains an atom holds when the part order on events is well founded
(`atm_of_wellFoundedLT`). The sections on negation (§6) and quantification (§7) are prose.
