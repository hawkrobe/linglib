# Bondarenko & Elliott (2026): monotonicity via mereology in attitude reports

[sharvit-2024]'s puzzle: a weak NPI is licensed in the relative clause of *Katya doesn't
believe the rumor that Anton has ever spread* but not in the complement clause of *Katya
doesn't believe the rumor that Anton has ever snowboarded*. Weak NPIs need an environment
that is Strawson downward- and not Strawson upward-entailing. Under the content-based
approach to clausal embedding, subset semantics for the *that*-clause makes the singular
definite both, by uniqueness collapse, while equality semantics (`CONT x = ⟦S⟧`) makes it
neither, by functionality. [bondarenko-elliott-2026] keep equality semantics and add
mereological structure to attitudinal eventualities and their contents, with informational
parthood `p' ≤ p` iff `p ⊆ p'`: the content function reflects proper parthood (`MSI`), the
theme function preserves it (`MSO`), a believing has the content of its theme (`TECM`), and
parts of believings are believings of the same holder (`BelievingDIV`).

`MSI` alone closes belief under entailment (`believes_of_ssubset`, `not_believes_of_ssubset`).
For *Katya believes the rumor that p*, the chain `TECM ∘ MSI ∘ BelievingDIV ∘ MSO` closes
the positive sentence under weakening of the rumor's content
(`believesTheRumorThat_of_ssubset`), so its negation is Strawson downward-entailing in the
restrictor (`not_believesTheRumorThat_of_ssubset`), while a model in which the agent
believes the weaker rumor but not the stronger shows that the negation is not Strawson
upward-entailing (`negated_not_sue`) — the profile the licensing condition demands. Closure
under conjunction needs two further principles, that the content of a sum is the
intersection of the contents and that one holder's believings are closed under sum
(`believes_inter`); without them belief need not close (`not_believes_inter`). Finally, the
paper's refinement of informational parthood to Fine's conjunctive parthood on alternative
sets is `Semantics.Truthmaker.IsContentPart`, and its witness that disjunction introduction
fails — *Jessica married an American linguist* does not make *Jessica married a linguist or
a philosopher* a conjunctive part — is `not_isContentPart_disjunction`.
