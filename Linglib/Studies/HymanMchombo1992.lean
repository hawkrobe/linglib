# Hyman and Mchombo 1992: morphotactic constraints in the Chichewa verb stem

Hyman and Mchombo study the orders in which the Chichewa verbal suffixes combine on a root such
as *mang-* 'tie': the causative *-its-*, the applicative *-ir-*, the reciprocal *-an-*, the
passive *-idw-* and the intensive *-ITS-*. Spell-out is cyclic and follows scope, but before a
feature is spelled out a final morph may be marked off, circumscribed, and restored after the
new one: *-ir-* and *-idw-* within the scope of the causative or the intensive, *-an-*
optionally within that of the applicative and, by the later rule (36), of the causative or the
intensive. The Repeated Morph Constraint (RMC) blocks two successive features spelled out by one
morph, an applicative on a reciprocal base spells *-an-* a second time, and the reciprocal and
the passive never combine, since a transitive verb is detransitivized only once. Circumscription
makes the negative filters (10) redundant (`filtered_of_mem_spellOut`). The authors close with
(34), which the cyclic account cannot exclude, and conclude that the causative is spelled out
first.

## Main definitions

* `Feature`, `Input`, `Stem`: the suffixal features, an input in order of scope, and a stem in
  surface order.
* `RMC`: the Repeated Morph Constraint, the OCP on the morph tier.
* `rules₀`, `rules`: the circumscriptions (15) and (22), and with them (36).
* `splits`, `cycle`, `spellOut`: the cyclic spell-out.
* `Feature.valency`, `Input.valency`: the valency each feature's voice derives.
* `Role`, `Feature.target?`, `Role.passiveScopes`: the thematic hierarchy (31) and its uses.

## Main results

* `filtered_of_mem_spellOut`: no spelled-out stem violates the filters (10).
* `rmc_of_mem_spellOut`, `mem_iff_of_mem_spellOut`: every spelled-out stem satisfies the RMC
  and spells out exactly the features of its input.
* `detransitivized_once`: (4a).
* `ambiguity_needs_late_rule`: (35), (36).
* `rank_lt_of_rules_ne_none`: (33), circumscription respects the hierarchy.
* `rows_spellOut`, `rows_cyclicFailures`, `rows_passive`, `rows_form`: the paper's examples.

## Implementation notes

* A feature's valency effect is that of the voice the fragment assigns it: it adds what the
  voice's derived frame adds to its initial frame or removes what it removes, and a voice that
  removes a core argument applies only to a base with at least the valency of its initial frame.
  The paper's one valency claim, (4a), is stated of `mang-`; the intensive, an adverbial, has no
  voice.
* The intensive is spelled out by the causative morph with a high tone (5b), so the RMC treats
  the two alike; the tone is written in capitals and the intensive reduplicates before another
  suffix (5a).
* The causative marks off one morph after another (18) and the intensive at most one (fn. 16);
  the applicative's only rule (22) marks off a single *-an-*. A cycle leaving an obligatory
  circumscription undone has no output. The respelled *-an-* (24) is added when the applicative
  is spelled out on a base containing a reciprocal and the base's own *-an-* was not marked off
  (22); the rule block's respelling of *-ir-* on a reciprocal cycle, which the paper shows
  blocked by the RMC, is omitted.
* The passive subjects of (27)–(30) are recorded on the rows and not derived, since the paper
  states only the order of the applicative and the passive. Rows marked ? or ?* carry no claim.

## TODO

* (25): the paper suggests that the degraded triple applicatives violate the RMC if respelled
  morphs are invisible, `OCP.IsCleanOn` on the tier without them; this needs stems that record
  which *-an-* is respelled.
* The Cibemba data (20) and the phonological case for cyclic spell-out.
