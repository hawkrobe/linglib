# Bondarenko (2020): factivity from pre-existence

Bondarenko accounts for the factivity alternation of Barguzin Buryat *hanaxa*, 'think' with a
finite CP and 'remember' with a nominalized clause. The nominalized clause presupposes that the
event it describes started before the thinking: a *began* continuation must place its start
before the matrix time, a future child or a fictional cat cannot be the object, and the
inference survives questions and negation. A CP modifies the thinking event, whose content its
complementizer fixes, and adds no presupposition. A nominalized clause saturates the internal
argument of the head θTh, which presupposes that this argument started before the matrix time;
closed by Fox's strong Kleene existential, the report presupposes exactly that, and the factive
inference follows.

## Main definitions

* `thetaTh`: the head θTh with *hanaxa*.
* `report`: the past-tense report with a nominalized clause.
* `reportThat`: the past-tense report with a CP.

## Main results

* `reportThat_presup`: a report with a CP presupposes nothing.
* `presup_closure_thetaTh`: the closed θTh-report presupposes pre-existence.
* `exists_preExists_of_report_presup`: the past-tense report presupposes pre-existence at some
  past thinking time.
* `exists_of_report_presup`: the factive inference.

## Implementation notes

* Pre-existence is `Event.PreExists` of `Semantics/Events/PreExistence.lean`, shared with
  `Studies/Williams2025`. Time spans are a function `τ` into `NonemptyInterval`, the run time of an
  event or the life span of an entity, and the paper's `LB(τ(x)) < t` is `(τ x).fst < t.fst`.
* Truth values are trivalent, as in the paper: a sentence is a `PartialProp`, defined when it is
  true or false. The existential closure (58) and the past tense (60) are both the strong Kleene
  existential `PartialProp.existsPartialStrong`, the tense over the past times `t' < t`
  (`t'.precedes t`) within the contextual interval `g(1)` (`t' ≤ g₁`).
* The simplification from (57) and (58) to (59) assumes a nonempty domain of events, as the
  paper's fn. 36 says, and (62) follows from (61) only for a nonempty contextual past: over an
  empty one the falsity condition of (61) holds vacuously and the sentence is defined whatever
  the complement. Both are hypotheses here.
* The verb and the Voice head are one predicate of events `P` at a world and time, so the
  external argument joins θTh's assertion and leaves its presupposition, as in (57). This is the
  weak Kleene conjunction `PartialProp.and` with a presuppositionless conjunct, not the strong
  Kleene one the paper adopts elsewhere; the two differ only when the subject is the experiencer
  of no event. θTh's `about` is a function from contentful events to their topics, as in (46).
* A report with both a nominalized clause and a CP (21) is θTh with a `P` that includes the CP's
  content condition, and has the nominalized clause's presupposition.
* Not formalized: the *tuxai* 'about' phrases (7), (48), which carry no presupposition and get
  no formula in the paper; the allosemy of θTh (49); and the plan readings of the future
  participle -xA (70)–(73), which the paper leaves open.
