# Turco, Braun and Dimroth (2014): When Contrasting Polarity, the Dutch Use Particles, Germans Intonation

This file formalizes [turco-braun-dimroth-2014], a production study of how Dutch and German
mark a switch from a negative to a positive polarity in two discourse contexts. A polarity
contrast, (1), asserts the positive claim of a different topic situation, in the sense of
[klein-2008], than the negative claim, so the two claims are compatible; a polarity correction,
(2), asserts it of the same topic situation, so the two claims exclude each other, the contrast
and correction of [umbach-2004]: `Sentence`, `Switch`, `IsContrast`, `IsCorrection`,
`Switch.disjoint_iff`, `IsCorrection.disjoint`, `exists_isContrast_not_disjoint`. In both
contexts German speakers produced Verum focus, a high-falling pitch accent on the finite verb,
[hohle-1992], and never a sentence-internal affirmative particle, whereas Dutch speakers mostly
produced the accented affirmative particle *wel*, `Dutch.Particles.wel`. The paper's
theoretical claim is that the two devices, though functionally equivalent, operate on different
levels: a sentence contains a polarity operator and, above it, an assertion operator carried by
the finite verb; *wel* is the overt affirmative value of the polarity operator, the counterpart
of *niet*, [sudhoff-2012], whereas Verum focus highlights the assertion operator,
`Sentence.polarityOp` and `Sentence.verumFocus`. Truth conditions do not depend on Verum focus
or on whether affirmation is overt, `denotation_verumFocus` and `denotation_affirmation`, the
functional equivalence; an overt polarity value fixes the polarity of its sentence, so *wel*
cannot occur in a negated sentence, while Verum focus can, `pol_of_polarityOp_eq_some` and
`exists_verumFocus_negative`, which is why the assertion operator takes effect above polarity,
as in [bluhdorn-2012]. The paper sets this against [sudhoff-2012], for whom focus on *wel* is
itself an instance of Verum focus: that the two devices do the same work does not put them on
the same level.

## Implementation notes

The polarity operator is a single slot of the sentence holding its overt value, if any, with
unmarked affirmation as the default, so a sentence with the affirmative particle is positive by
construction and *Het kind heeft wel niet gehuild* is not a `Sentence`.
The production results are not formalized. Dutch speakers used *wel* in most utterances of both
contexts, fewer in correction, an effect the paper leaves unexplained, and Verum focus never in
contrast and rarely in correction; German speakers used Verum focus in more than 70% of the
utterances of both contexts and never a sentence-internal particle. In correction only, some
German speakers produced the polarity particle *doch*, `German.PolarityParticle.doch`, as a
separate utterance before a Verum focus utterance; the paper codes the combination as another
realization, not an affirmative particle, since *doch* never carried the correction by
itself. *Wel* was mostly accented, as a downstepped fall in
contrast and as a fall in correction, and the pitch range of German Verum focus was larger in
correction than in contrast; the paper attributes the greater prominence of correction either to
the strength of undoing a denial, [hogeweg-2009], or to the absence of a contrastive topic accent
before the comment. The examples are the rows of `Data.Examples.TurcoBraunDimroth2014`.
