# Magri (2009): A Theory of Individual-Level Predicates Based on Blind Mandatory Scalar Implicatures

[magri-2009] explains the oddness of *#Some Italians come from a warm country* and of
*#Sometimes, John is tall* by one mechanism, the blind mandatory scalar implicature. The
strengthened meaning is [fox-2007]'s innocent exclusion computed with logical entailment, blind to
common knowledge (the Blindness Hypothesis (32)), and a sentence whose strengthened meaning
contradicts common knowledge is odd (the Mismatch Hypothesis (33), `Odd`). Blindness is
essential: with entailment given common knowledge these sentences would not be strengthened at
all (`exhIE_image_inter`). The implicature is mandatory because relevance, constrained by (43),
cannot set aside an alternative that is contextually equivalent to the utterance
(`disjoint_exhR`), while an ordinary implicature depends on the context (`exists_isRelevance`).
Both hypotheses carry over to presuppositions, (65) and (66) (`odd_univ_iff`).

Individual-level predicates differ from stage-level ones only in common knowledge: they are
permanent, (70) (`Permanent`), hence homogeneous over any part of a lifespan (`Homogeneous`,
(71)). The oddness of *sometimes* with *tall*, (72b), is then that of *some* with *come from a
warm country*, (73) (`odd_some`, `sometimes_odd`). An existential in the scope of a universal,
against its alternatives with definite descriptions (49), (94), is odd when common knowledge fixes
a single witness for it (`odd_narrowSome`). This covers the fronted indefinite of (46a) and (54a)
(`winner_odd`, `running_odd`) and the existential reading of a bare plural subject of an
individual-level predicate, (84b), whose narrowest scope puts it below GEN (`existential_odd`).
A universal over individuals rescues the existential, since distinct individuals may have distinct
witnesses, (54b) and (102b) (`table_not_odd`, `universal_not_odd`). The same computation predicts
the German word order facts of [diesing-1992], (8) and (125) (`word_order_rows`). Overt *always*
competes with GEN, which presupposes homogeneity, so *#John is always tall* is odd, (134a)
(`always_odd`), but *Firemen are always tall* is not, (139b) (`always_bare_not_odd`).

## Implementation notes

* Propositions are sets of worlds. A world of §3.3 and §4 is the extension of the one predicate
  at issue over individuals and an index (times, or objects and times), with lifespans, nouns and
  restrictors held fixed, so every extension is a logically possible world. The worlds the paper
  exhibits, (98), the table of (54) and the world of §4.3, are constructed.
* GEN contributes its universal assertion (137) to truth conditions; its homogeneity
  presupposition is used only in §4.6, as in the paper. The restrictor `C̃` of (90) is arbitrary,
  as in the paper, and the definite alternatives (93b) restrict GEN to the part of each lifespan
  in `C`.
* The world (98) is sampled at three times of `C̃`, one in each fireman's stretch of tallness in
  the paper's picture.

## TODO

* The alternatives of the episodic existential reading (92b), sketched in footnote 20, are not
  formalized.
* The facts of §4.4 (non-kind bare plurals, association with *only*, statives, locatives) are
  discussion only, and the contrast (133) with definite subjects is left open by the paper.
