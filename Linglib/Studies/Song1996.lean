# Song (1996): Causatives and causation

[song-1996] classifies causative constructions by what joins the expression of cause to the
expression of effect. In the COMPACT type [Vcause] and [Veffect] share one clause, fused (English
*kill*), bound (Turkish *öl-dür*) or free (French *faire lire*); in the AND type a clause of cause
and a clause of effect are coordinated, in that order (Vata *le*); in the PURP type the clause of
effect is a clause of purpose (Korean *-ke*) (chapter 2). The traditional typology, lexical,
morphological and syntactic, splits the COMPACT type and lumps the other two together (§1.2). The
COMPACT type being the diachronic residue of the other two, what distinguishes those is
implicativity: the AND type expresses the EVENT and RESULT stages of the cognitive structure of
causation GOAL → EVENT → RESULT and entails its effect, the PURP type expresses GOAL and EVENT and
does not, except through the inference that people realize the goals they act for (chapter 5).
The grammatical relation of the causee follows no hierarchy of its own: a language caps the core
NPs of a simplex clause, causative or not, and its causatives keep within the cap (chapter 6).

`Form.type` computes the type of a form and `Form.traditional` its traditional class, and on
Song's examples neither classification refines the other (`not_factorsThrough_type`,
`not_factorsThrough_traditional`). A biclausal type entails its effect in every model exactly
when it expresses RESULT (`forall_meaning_subset_iff`), so the AND type is implicative and the
PURP type is not (`and_meaning_subset`, `purp_not_implicative`), as the example (7) bears out
(`effectNegated_rows`), while COMPACT causatives go either way (`compact_implicativity_varies`);
the success assumption restores implicativity (`meaning_subset_of_success`). The paradigm
causative of [comrie-1989]'s case hierarchy never has more than three core NPs
(`paradigmCoreNPs_le_three`), so a language capped at two refutes the hierarchy for transitive
bases (`paradigmCoreNPs_two`).

## Implementation notes

* A form records the structure Song reads off an example: one clause and how [Vcause] is
  realized, or two clauses, their link and their order. The forms of the examples are row
  features, and their types are computed.
* The traditional class of a free [Vcause] is morphological, after [comrie-1989]'s treatment of
  the French causative as quasi-morphological, which Song reports (p. 161); Song's own
  description of the traditional typology (p. 135) does not place it.
* The semantic structures are those of the prototypical types. A model interprets the three
  stages by arbitrary propositions, so that entailing the effect is doing so in every model. The
  cline of implicativity within the PURP type (p. 136; a survey of sixteen Korean speakers, §4.5)
  and the implicativity of COMPACT causatives are outside the model.
* `paradigmCoreNPs` counts the indirect object as a core NP, as in a language capped at three
  (p. 174). That the paradigm case keeps within a cap of three is drawn here rather than stated
  by Song, who argues the reinterpretation for extended demotion and doubling (§6.5).

## TODO

* The diachronic model of causative affixes (chapter 3): four stages from a construction whose
  [Vcause] is obligatory to a causative affix, and the argument that PURP, overt and meaningful,
  can take over [Vcause] while AND, often covert and empty, cannot (pp. 80–85).
* The measures by which causatives keep within the cap (§§6.4–6.6): omission, demotion to an
  adjunct, doubling and detransitivization.
