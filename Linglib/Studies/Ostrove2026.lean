# Ostrove (2026): Obligatorily Overt PRO in San Martín Peras Mixtec

Ostrove argues that San Martín Peras Mixtec (SMPM) has obligatory control whose controlled subject
must be an overt clitic pronoun. Its three embedded clause types, finite clauses, tensed
subjunctives and untensed subjunctives, are told apart by aspect, tense and restructuring
(`unrestrictedTAM_iff`, `independentTense_iff`, `frontingOut_iff`), and only the untensed
subjunctive shows Landau's signature of obligatory control (`isObligatory_iff`). Exempt anaphors
reject quantified antecedents yet occur in untensed subjunctives under quantified controllers, so
the controlled subject is a pronoun rather than a copy left by movement (`smpm_refutes_movement`).
The analysis is morphological: bound variables are minimal pronouns realized by vocabulary items,
and SMPM lacks the null item that yields silent PRO elsewhere, so the elsewhere pronoun surfaces
(`smpm_overt_pro`, `syncretism_typology`). A tentative universal closes the argument: overt PRO
entails no pro-drop (`Universal54`).

## Implementation notes

The properties of (26) and the control profile are read off the paper's example rows
(`Data/Examples/Ostrove2026.json`), whose clause types agree with the fragment's verbs
(`clauseTypeOf_mem_verbOf`). The rows bear out (26) except in its restructuring column, which
footnote 8's exception under *kòni* 'want' breaks (`restructures_iff`). The paper's examples of
non-exhaustive binding in tensed subjunctives are a missing cross-reference in the manuscript, so
partial control is attested only as absent from untensed subjunctives. Landau's calculus fits the
three types only if the tensed subjunctive is `[+Agr]` (`landau_predicts_control_iff`), which the
paper does not discuss. The pro-drop status is the paper's own 101A cell, as WALS does not sample
the language. Example numbers follow the manuscript version of the article.
