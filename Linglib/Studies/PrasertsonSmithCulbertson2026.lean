# Prasertsom, Smith and Culbertson (2026): Domain-General Categorisation Explains Constrained Cross-Linguistic Variation in Noun Classification

This file formalizes the two formal claims of [prasertsom-smith-culbertson-2026]. The paper asks
why animacy, but never colour, serves as a basis for noun classification although both are
perceptually salient, and answers with a domain-general principle: a good category is one whose
defining feature predicts the other features of its members, and animacy predicts more than
colour. The typological premise is read off [aikhenvald-2000]'s sample of noun categorization
devices, where animacy is a basic semantic parameter and colour is none of any device's
(`animacy_not_colour`). The predictive-power manipulation of Experiments 3a and 3b rests on two
sixteen-stimulus sets, Tables 4 and 5 (`predictiveAnimacy`, `predictiveColour`), built so that
the conditional entropy of horn type, body shape, and appendage shape is lower given the
predictive dimension than given the other, and so that exchanging the animacy and colour columns
of one set gives the other (`mirror_images`). The six entropy orderings of Table 6 that the
design promises are proved from the tables under the uniform measure over the stimuli
(`predictiveAnimacy_horn`, `predictiveColour_horn`, and their shape and appendage siblings).

## Implementation notes

Each stimulus set has exactly one stimulus per animacy–colour pair, so a set is a function from
the pair to the three remaining dimensions and its stimuli are the sixteen cells of the grid.
Conditional entropy is the substrate's `H[X | Y ; μ]` under the uniform measure on the grid,
reduced to counts by `condEntropy_uniformOn_univ`; each ordering then comes to a positive multiple
of `negMulLog (1/2)`, the entropy of the evenly split fibres that only the non-predictive
dimension has. The learning and sorting results of Experiments 1a to 3b and the corpus measures
of §4.1, which are means over participants and word embeddings, are not formalized.

## TODO

The paper's reason for the mirror design, that animacy in one set has exactly the predictive
power of colour in the other, is the invariance of conditional entropy under a relabelling of
the population and of the conditioning variable; the substrate has no such lemma yet, so the
predictive-colour orderings are computed directly rather than transferred from the
predictive-animacy ones through `mirror_images`.
