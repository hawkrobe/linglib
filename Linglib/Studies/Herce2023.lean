# Herce (2023): The Typological Diversity of Morphomes

This file formalizes two morphomes of [herce-2023] as instances of `Morphology.IsMorphome`,
the book's working definition of a morphome as a systematic syncretism that is not a natural
class (§1.4), with a natural class one coextensive with a value or conjunction of values,
`Morphology.IsValueConjunction`. The Spanish L-morphome of Table 1.2, the first person
singular of the present indicative together with the whole present subjunctive, is the
syncretism class of the velar stems of *venir* and *nacer* and of the suppletive stem of
*caber* (`venir_morphome`); the Darma syncretism of Table 4.32, the first person plural with
the second person, is the class of the non-past suffix *-he-n* and of the past suffix *-n-su*
of *ra* 'come' (`nonpast_morphome`). Each class is a value conjunction of none of its
paradigm's features (`Lset_not_natural`), and its recurrence under distinct exponents is the
systematicity the definition asks for.

## Implementation notes

* The paradigms are Table 1.2 and Table 4.32 as printed, stems and suffixes typed as the
  tables segment them: *venir* has the diphthongized stem in the second and third singular
  and third plural of the indicative, the optional final *-i* of the Darma second person
  plural non-past is dropped, and the transitive allomorph *-de* is prose.
* The definition also returns the past-tense class of *-ju*, the elsewhere form, the
  limitation the substrate records.
