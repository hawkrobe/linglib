# Halpert (2012): Argument Licensing and Agreement in Zulu

Halpert argues that Zulu has structural licensing, but by heads other than the familiar ones. A
Licensing head L⁰ above vP probes every phrase in vP and licenses the highest, and the verb V⁰
licenses its complement when a causative or applicative head has passed it a case feature, the
pattern Halpert relates to Burzio's generalization. Nominals with the augment vowel and clauses
headed by *ukuthi* are licensed intrinsically, while augmentless nominals and clauses headed by
*sengathi* must be local to a licensing head; augmented nominals still intervene. The verb shows
L⁰'s probing, conjoint when it finds a goal and disjoint when it fails, and A-movement out of vP
precedes the probing, the one order Chomsky's Activity Condition leaves.

## Main definitions

* `Halpert2012.Clause`: a clause after A-movement, its vP split at V⁰'s c-command domain.
* `Halpert2012.Clause.Converges`: every phrase needing licensing is reached by L⁰ or V⁰.
* `Halpert2012.Clause.spellout`: the verb form L⁰'s probing determines.

## Main results

* `Halpert2012.Clause.converges_iff`: the licensing generalization of §3.3.3.
* `Halpert2012.Clause.countP_le_one`, `Halpert2012.Clause.countP_le_two`: one phrase needing
  licensing in a vP without extensions, two with them.
* `Halpert2012.Clause.spellout_eq_disjoint_iff`: the verb is disjoint iff vP is empty.
* `Halpert2012.search_eq_search_evacuate`: under Activity, probing before A-movement reaches the
  goal probing after it reaches.
* `Halpert2012.Clause.rows`: the paradigms of chapters 3 and 4.

## Implementation notes

Phrases that left vP or attach above it are listed in `Clause.outside` without positions. A
prefixed oblique enters as the nominal inside it, which L⁰ sees (§4.4.2), and noun class, which
plays no role in licensing, is not recorded. Every row with an augmentless nominal is in a
downward-entailing context, the semantic condition of §3.2.

## TODO

Raising-to-object, which licenses an augmentless embedded subject in the matrix vP ((123)–(125),
(216)), needs two clauses. Some speakers accept (141b) (footnote 8).

  /-- The goal is an adverb, such as *kahle* 'well'. -/
