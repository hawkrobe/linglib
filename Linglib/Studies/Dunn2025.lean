# Dunn (2025): Syntactic Variation from Individuals to Populations: Language as a Complex System

Dunn measures syntactic variation as differences in how individuals, populations and
registers use one umbrella construction grammar. A construction is a contiguous sequence of
slot-constraints, each drawn from one of three ontologies, lexical, syntactic or semantic. The
grammar emerges in stages: two early grammars each draw on one ontology, lexical or syntactic, and
the late grammar on all three. First-order constructions are bundled into third-order
constructions and these into fourth-order ones, and a construction is central or peripheral by its
frequency in a reference corpus. Two samples of usage are compared by the pipeline of Figure 3:
token frequencies are standardized across the samples, weighted by how much the classifiers rely
on each construction, compared by cosine distance, and the distances standardized across the
sampled comparisons.

The two standardizations do what the book says they are for. Standardizing frequencies makes the
distances blind to how frequent a construction is overall, standardizing distances keeps their
ranking, and the sign of a set of comparisons' mean standardized distance says whether its
samples are more or less similar than the average pair.

## Main statements

* `Stage.eq_semPlus_of_admits_of_ne`: a construction that mixes ontologies emerges only in the
  late grammar.
* `standardizedDistance_const_mul_add_const`: rescaling a construction's frequencies across the
  samples changes no standardized distance.
* `standardizedDistance_le_standardizedDistance_iff`: the standardized distances rank the
  comparisons as the cosine distances do.
* `sign_integral_standardizedDistance`: the sign of a set of comparisons' mean standardized
  distance says whether its samples are more or less similar than average.

## Implementation notes

* Learned syntactic categories are rendered by the part of speech of their exemplars, noun phrase
  slots as phrasal slots, and semantic constraints by their human-readable labels.
* The book does not say how the frequency of a higher-order construction is counted, so the
  pipeline is stated for any type of constructions and the network carries no frequencies.
* The sampled comparisons are a finite type mapped to pairs of samples, so a pair may be drawn
  twice.
* Grammar induction, the classifiers, the Bayesian confidence intervals, Figure 1's counts and
  the accuracy tables are not represented; the classifiers enter only through their weights.

## TODO

* The accuracy tables, such as Table 6, belong in `Data/Experiments`.
