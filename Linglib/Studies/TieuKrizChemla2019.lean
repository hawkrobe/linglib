# Tieu, Križ and Chemla (2019): Children's acquisition of homogeneity in plural definite descriptions

*The trucks are blue* and *The trucks are not blue* are both neither true nor false when some but
not all of the trucks are blue, a GAP context. Tieu, Križ and Chemla test four- and five-year-old
French-speaking children on such sentences and on the *not all* implicature of *some*, against
Magri's account, on which the definite means *some* and reaches *all* by exhaustifying twice, the
*not all* implicature being a step of that computation.

A child may instead read the definite as a quantifier, existential or universal, scoping under
or over negation. Such a construal is classical, and a reading is the supervaluation over its
construals: the homogeneous reading over the existential and the universal construal, as in the
paper's statement of the supervaluation account, and the scope-ambiguous universal of
Experiment 2 over the two scopes of the universal.

## Main results

* `value_of_isGap`: in a GAP context the readings take the values of Figure 2 and Table 8;
  `value_of_subset`, `value_of_disjoint`: elsewhere they agree, which the control trials check.
* `value_homogeneous`: the homogeneous reading is Križ's trivalent plural.
* `binaryPattern_quantified_bijective`: the four quantified readings give the four possible
  pairs of binary judgments, one of them the wide-scope existential that no child showed.
* `binaryPattern_eq_wideScopeUniversal`, `gapPattern_injective`: binary judgments conflate the
  homogeneous reading with the wide-scope universal, and ternary ones separate them.
* `homogeneous_weakNegation`: the homogeneous reading with weak negation is the universal one.
* `definite_in_gap_iff_some_in_all`: on Magri's account a participant accepts the positive
  definite in a GAP context exactly when they accept *some* where every object has the property.
* `implicaturePattern_of_isGap`: the account predicts the existential pattern without the
  implicature and the homogeneous one with it.

## Implementation notes

A world is the set of objects with the property. Magri's account is the double strengthening of
`Studies/Magri2014`, and a participant computes the *not all* implicature exactly when *all* is
among their alternatives to *some* (`.strong ∈ A`), since the paper's argument rests on the two
inferences sharing their alternatives. A binary judgment accepts exactly the true sentences, and
Table 8's rewards 1, 0 and −1 are the three truth values. Not formalized are Table 8's
partial-truth group, which on the definite responds as the homogeneous one; the ternary coding
of the implicature trials, after Katsos and Bishop; and the statistics. In Experiment 1, 16 of 24
children were homogeneous and 8 existential, and 6 of the homogeneous children and 5 of 22 adults
lacked the implicature; in Experiment 2 the homogeneous group without the implicature had 5 of 24
children and 2 of 25 adults.

## TODO

The printed Table 2 has the universal groups accept the positive sentence in a GAP context,
against Figure 2. The printed Table 8 gives the scope-ambiguous and wide-scope universal groups
GAP rewards that contradict their definitions beside it, and fixes rows for *all* under negation
and *some* in a GAP context that no definition determines. The definitions are followed.
