# Karttunen (1973): Presuppositions of Compound Sentences

This file formalizes [karttunen-1973], which asks how the presuppositions of a compound sentence
are determined by those of its parts. The cumulative hypothesis of Langendoen and Savin adds them
up; Karttunen keeps it for the *holes*, factives, aspectuals and implicatives, which let every
presupposition of their complement through, and sets against them the *plugs*, verbs of saying,
which let none through, and the *filters*, the connectives, which let a presupposition of their
second clause through unless the first clause filters it: `if A then B` (13) and `A and B` (17)
presuppose what `A` presupposes and each presupposition of `B` that `A` does not entail, and
`A or B` (24) each presupposition of `B` that `¬A` does not entail.

A sentence is a computation of the Writer monad whose value is its assertion and whose log lists
its presuppositions, each filtered on its own (`Presupposing`), the side-effect carrier of
[giorgolo-asudeh-2012]. The monad's own composition concatenates the logs, and is the cumulative
hypothesis (`conj_false`); a hole maps the value and keeps the log, internal negation among them;
a plug keeps the value and drops the log; and a filter drops from the second clause's log what the
first clause filters. The connectives take the filtering relation as a parameter: entailment in
the original conditions, entailment from assumed facts in the revisions of §9 (`Filters`).

§8 derives the rule for conjunction and the rule for disjunction from the rule for conditionals by
Harman's principles, that internal negation keeps presuppositions and that the classical
equivalences of `A ⊃ B` with `¬A ∨ B` and of `A & B` with `¬(¬A ∨ ¬B)` keep them
(`harman_conj`, `harman_disj`), and the rules satisfy the principles. The rules are not
commutative ((16), (22)), so the principle that equivalent sentences share presuppositions can
hold only of such chosen equivalences. §9's Geraldine example (25) presupposes (27) absolutely but
not given (28), and does again in the contrary context the paper sketches; the Nixon examples (30)
call for the same relativization with every connective. §10 finds no truth-functional three-valued
conjunction that behaves like a filter: Bochvar's internal conjunction is a hole, his external one
a plug, and Łukasiewicz's filters by the falsity of the other conjunct, so that (35b) comes out
presupposition-free and (35a) does not. §11 finds that a hole *believe* survives (37) only through
the equivalence (38), and fails on (42), whence the tentative verdict that attitude verbs are
plugs.

## Implementation notes

* A sentence's presuppositions are a list, the finite list of basic presuppositions of
  [karttunen-1974-presupposition]'s (5); only membership matters.
* The entailment a filter uses is from the truth of the first clause, which requires its
  presuppositions as well as its assertion (`Presupposing.truth`), so a presupposition that both
  clauses share is filtered as the second clause's and kept as the first's, as fn. 10 says. A
  filter thus reads the first clause's log, which no composition in the monad can
  ([giorgolo-asudeh-2012]).
* The per-presupposition rule is tested on *Jack has children, and Jack's children regret that
  baldness is hereditary*, built from the presuppositions of (1a) and (1b): it filters the first
  presupposition of the second conjunct and keeps the second, where a single conjoined
  presupposition would keep both.
* Murphy's restrictions on the assumed facts of §9 are read set-theoretically: some set of the
  facts, possibly empty, entails the presupposition together with the premise, is consistent with
  the premise, and does not entail the presupposition alone. On this reading the empty set filters
  only a presupposition the premise entails, of a consistent premise, that is not a tautology
  (`filters_empty_iff`), so the revised condition keeps the tautological presupposition of fn. 13
  (`univ_mem_log_disj_filters`), which the footnote counts as filtered under the revised condition
  as well as the original.
* The assumed facts are a set of propositions, not a deductively closed common ground: over the
  propositions a closed context accepts, Murphy's first restriction blocks nothing, since a
  context that entails `¬A` accepts `A ⊃ C` too (`filters_sets_of_compl_mem`).
* Van Fraassen's conjunction (34c), which the paper finds to behave as Łukasiewicz's on (35), is
  left out.
