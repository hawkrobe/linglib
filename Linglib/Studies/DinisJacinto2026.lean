# Dinis and Jacinto (2026): Marginality Scales for Gradable Adjectives

Dinis and Jacinto give the degrees of a vague gradable adjective the structure of their theory
of marginal and large differences, ML theory, simplified to a linear order with one primitive,
*marginally smaller than*. A degree is largely smaller than another when it is smaller but not
marginally so. As in Kennedy's semantics, an adjective measures objects at circumstances of
evaluation by degrees, and the comparative compares degrees; as in Fara's, the positive form
holds of an object whose degree is largely greater than the standard of comparison. The positive
form then cannot tell apart degrees that differ at most marginally, so its extension is clustered
and tolerant, a Soritical sequence must contain a large step, and an object that leaves the
extension must have become smaller on the scale.

## Main statements

* `marginalScaleEquiv`: along a linear order, the five axioms with largely smaller than defined
  are the eleven of the 2025 paper.
* `comparative_of_positive_of_not_positive`: an object that leaves the positive form's extension
  has become smaller on the scale, which the two-scale alternative does not predict.
* `clustered_positive`: at most marginally different degrees are alike for the positive form,
  so its extension is clustered and tolerant.
* `exists_large_step_of_soritical`: a Soritical sequence for the positive form crosses into the
  extension at a large step.

## Implementation notes

* ML scales are `Degree.MarginalScale`, whose five axioms are those of Figure 1 with largely
  smaller than unfolded.
* A measure function takes a circumstance of evaluation and an object to a degree. The context
  enters only through the standard of comparison and the scale, which are held fixed.
* The text calls marginal difference transitive and large difference possibly intransitive
  (p. 106). Marginally smaller than and at most marginal difference are transitive, while
  marginal difference, being symmetric and irreflexive, is not, and large difference never is.
