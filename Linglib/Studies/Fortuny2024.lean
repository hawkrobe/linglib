# Fortuny (2024): Deducing the Coordinand Constraint

Fortuny deduces the Coordinand Constraint, Grosu's half of Ross's Coordinate Structure
Constraint, that no coordinand may be moved (5). A coordinator is Steedman's categorial-grammar
functor `(X/X)/X` (10), so two constituents coordinate exactly when they are of one category, and
a category is its set of generalized categorial features together with its bar-level features
(12), (18)–(21). The Coordinability Condition (22) is therefore a theorem (`coordinable_iff`),
not a stipulation. A coordinand moved for a criterial feature the other coordinand lacks is not
coordinable with it (Case 1, `not_coordinable_of_mem_of_notMem`), and neither are two coordinands
moved for different features (Case 2, subcase I). Categorially identical coordinands fall under
the Integrity Condition (50), by which a probe targets the coordinate structure and never a
coordinand within it, and the same constituent cannot occupy both coordinated positions (71), a
coordination the coordinator's denotation makes semantically vacuous
(`Coordinator.denote_pair_self`).

The paper's judgments are the rows of `Data/Examples/Fortuny2024.json`; `rows_predicted` checks
them against the three-factor decomposition, and `rows_factor` that each ill-formed coordination
falls under exactly one factor, as §2.3 claims.

## Implementation notes

* Movement is not derived: the rows record which coordinands move, and the Integrity Condition
  is stated as the paper states it, with its Least Effort rationale (58) as `superfluous_of_twice`.
* Base categorial features are the paper's [D], [P], [C], [I], [V], [Adj] of (14) plus the
  criterial [wh], [focus], [topic] ([rizzi-1997]) and the unvalued case feature of (59)–(62);
  bar-level features follow [muysken-1982]. All coordinands in the data are maximal projections.
* Feature percolation (§2.2.1.3) is recorded on the rows rather than computed.

/-! ### Categories as feature clusters (§2.1) -/

/-- The bar-level features of [muysken-1982] make a minimal category `[−projected, −maximal]`, an
intermediate one `[+projected, −maximal]` and a maximal one `[+projected, +maximal]` (18)–(20). -/

  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- A maximal projection is projected and maximal. -/
def BarLevel.max : BarLevel := ⟨true, true⟩

/-- The generalized categorial features (12) determine a constituent's distribution. They are the
base categories of (14), the criterial features of the left periphery ([rizzi-1997]) that trigger
internal Merge (23), and the unvalued case feature of (59)–(62). -/

  Category.ext_iff

/-! ### The categorematic coordinator (10)–(11) -/

/-- Among the categorial-grammar types over categories, `slash r a` selects an `a` and yields an
`r`. -/
inductive CGType where
  | of : Category → CGType
  | slash : CGType → CGType → CGType
  deriving DecidableEq

def CGType.apply : CGType → CGType → Option CGType
  | .slash r a, b => if a = b then some r else none
  | .of _, _ => none

/-- A coordinator is `(X/X)/X` (10). It selects an internal coordinand of category `X`, yields
`X/X`, selects an external coordinand of category `X`, and yields a coordinate structure of
category `X`. -/

def Coordinable (α β : Category) : Prop := ∃ X, coordinate X α β = some (.of X)

/-! ### Case 1 and Case 2, subcase I (§2.2.1, §2.2.2.1) -/

/-- A coordinand carrying a categorial feature the other lacks, as when it alone is attracted by a
probe for that feature (23), is not coordinable with it (24). -/

/-- In subcase I of Case 2 (47), a `[+topic]` and a `[+focus]` coordinand each carry a feature the

/-- Identity is not required of the elements inside the coordinands (30). -/
example : Coordinable ⟨{.D}, .max⟩ ⟨{.D}, .max⟩ := by decide

/-! ### The Integrity Condition (50) and its rationale (§2.2.2.2) -/

/-- A probe might target the whole coordinate structure or one of its two coordinands. -/
inductive Position where
  | whole
  | left
  | right
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- A well-formed coordinate structure has a coordinator of some role with two coordinands of one
category `X`, which it projects. -/
structure CoordStructure where
  role : Coordinator.Role
  X : Category

/-- In a well-formed coordinate structure of category `X` whose coordinands carry `φ`, a probe
searching for `[+φ]` targets the coordinate structure and not a coordinand within it (50). -/
def CoordStructure.Goal (cs : CoordStructure) (φ : CatFeature) (p : Position) : Prop :=
  φ ∈ cs.X.cf ∧ p = .whole

/-- In Pattern 1 (51b), (53), neither coordinand is a goal, so the coordinands cannot move to
separate specifiers, with or without the coordinate structure. -/
theorem CoordStructure.not_goal_coordinand (cs : CoordStructure) (φ : CatFeature) :
    ¬ cs.Goal φ .left ∧ ¬ cs.Goal φ .right :=
  ⟨fun h ↦ Position.noConfusion h.2, fun h ↦ Position.noConfusion h.2⟩

/-- A probe for the unvalued case feature targets a DP coordination as a whole, so a single
coordinand cannot raise to the subject position (59)–(62). -/
theorem CoordStructure.goal_uCase (r : Coordinator.Role) :
    (CoordStructure.mk r ⟨{.D, .uCase}, .max⟩).Goal .uCase .whole ∧
      ¬ (CoordStructure.mk r ⟨{.D, .uCase}, .max⟩).Goal .uCase .left :=
  ⟨⟨by simp, rfl⟩, fun h ↦ Position.noConfusion h.2⟩

/-- A derivation records the positions moved for each feature. -/
def Derivation := CatFeature → List Position

/-- A derivation is superfluous when a coordinand moves twice for one feature, once on its own and
once inside the coordinate structure (58), which the Least Effort Principle (79) bans. -/

  ⟨φ, by simp⟩

/-! ### The Prohibition against Self-Coordination (71) -/

/-- An occurrence of a constituent records its category and the derivational step at which it
entered the computation (fn. 16), so two selections of one constituent are two occurrences. -/
structure Occurrence where
  cat : Category
  step : ℕ
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- A coordination is well formed only if its coordinands are coordinable and are distinct
occurrences, so a constituent cannot appear in both coordinated positions (71). Such a coordination
would also be semantically vacuous, the coordinator's operation returning the constituent
(`Coordinator.denote_pair_self`), which §2.3 relates to the Least Effort Principle. -/
def WellFormed (α β : Occurrence) : Prop := Coordinable α.cat β.cat ∧ α ≠ β

/-! ### The judgments -/

/-- A probe outside the coordinate structure attracts no coordinand, one, both, or the whole. -/
inductive Moved where
  | none
  | left
  | right
  | both
  | whole
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- A coordination of the data records the two coordinands' categories, which of them move, and
whether they are one and the same occurrence. -/
structure Row where
  left : Category
  right : Category
  moved : Moved
  same : Bool
  judgment : Judgment
  deriving DecidableEq

Condition (50) forbids. -/

  | .left | .right | .both => True
  | .none | .whole => False

  unfold Moved.Coordinand; split <;> infer_instance

/-- The three factors of §2.3 are that the coordinands are not coordinable (10)/(22), that they
are but a coordinand is attracted (50), and that the coordinands are one occurrence (71). -/
