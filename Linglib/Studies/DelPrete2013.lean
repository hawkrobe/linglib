# Del Prete (2013): Imperfectivity and habituality in Italian

This file formalizes the plurality-based analysis of the Italian Imperfetto in [del-prete-2013].
A bare imperfective is habitual or progressive according to whether its reference situation is
large or small, and on the habitual reading a singular indefinite object is understood as the
same object across the repeated events, the same-object effect of (2). The imperfective feature
spreads an event property over the forward expansion of the reference situation in a branching
model of situations, (16): every branch of the expanded situation lies within the temporal trace
of some event with the property. Verbs refer to plural events, [kratzer-2008]'s lexical
cumulativity hypothesis, and thematic roles are sum homomorphisms from events into the lattice
of individuals of [link-1983] and [krifka-1998], so a plural event whose theme is a singular
individual has that individual as the theme of each of its singular sub-events, the sameness
principle SSP. The same-object effect is thereby an entailment of the truth conditions (24), and
over a large reference situation the covering event must be plural, §5. A bare plural names the
kind, [carlson-1977] and [chierchia-1998], and a predication of a kind distributes its instances
over the singular sub-events, (21), so bare plurals show a kind-level effect only, (30); the
Q-adverb *sempre* forms a restricted universal over situations below the imperfective, (29), and
the indefinite in its scope varies with the situation. The oddness of (2b) against (2a) is then
[magri-2009]'s principle (O), §7: habitually reading one philosophy book conflicts with common
knowledge, habitually driving one sports car does not. Against the covert quantifier GEN of
[krifka-etal-1995], §2, the obligatory wide scope of indefinites that the effect would demand
gives the negated kind indefinite of (9b) the truth conditions (10b), strictly weaker than the
intuitive (10'b).

## Implementation notes

Tense and the reference time adverbial, (15) and (18), fix the reference situation, which
matters to the analysis only through its size, so the theorems are stated at the level of the
aspectual phrase, (24e). The branches of a situation are its sub-situations lying within a
single history, given by a predicate `linear`, and the forward expansion, taken from [deo-2009]
and which the chapter does not take to be a function, is a parameter `fexp` chosen per
utterance. Verbs are event predicates with the agent conjunct folded in, the lexical
cumulativity hypothesis is `Mereology.AlgClosure` of the singular events, and a plural event is
`Mereology.IsPlural`, the iteration of the same volume's [boneh-doron-2013]. The kind of a noun
is a parameter, the sum of its individuals, and a "kind coerced" indefinite ranges over a given
set of sub-kinds, parts of the kind. Example numbers are those of the HAL preprint hal-00920848.

## TODO

Footnote 28 argues that the sports car of (22) cannot vary across the branches of the expanded
situation, since the reference situation itself lies within the trace of each covering event.
The truth conditions (24g) choose a covering event per branch, and no axiom of the model
identifies the parts of two such events at the reference situation, so the sameness proved in
`hab_soe` is per covering event.
