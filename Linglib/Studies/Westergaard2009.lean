# Westergaard (2009): The Acquisition of Word Order: Micro-Cues, Information Structure, and Economy

This file formalizes the syntactic model of Westergaard's monograph. Verb second is not one
parameter but a setting per clause-type head of a split ForceP, one head per sentence type in
root clauses and one each for embedded declaratives and embedded questions, so that a
language's grammar is the set of cells, a sentence type in an embedding context, in which the
finite verb moves to the left periphery. Her Table 3.1 gives that set for six Germanic
varieties. The fragments record, from the reference grammars and from her own descriptions,
where verb second is obligatory, optional or excluded, and her binary settings agree with
them: each grammar contains the cells where the fragment requires verb second and lies within
the cells where it allows it, and for five of the six varieties it is exactly the required
cells. What children acquire are micro-cues, pieces of structure stating for one cell what its
specifier holds and whether the verb fills its head, and four cues separate the five grammars
of her Table 3.2. In the Tromsø dialect the monosyllabic *wh*-words *ka*, *kem* and *kor* are
heads and sit in Int⁰ themselves, which blocks verb movement there; the verb second that still
occurs is movement to a lower Top⁰, whose feature a given subject checks from the specifier and
a focused subject leaves for the verb, so that these questions are verb second exactly when the
subject is new.

## Main definitions

* `V2Grammar`: a set of cells, the clause-type heads the finite verb moves to.
* `stdNorwegian`, `stdEnglish`, `nordmore`, `belfast`, `german`, `danish`: the grammars of
  Table 3.1.
* `MicroCue`, `Expresses`: a cue and its expression by a grammar.
* `TromsøWh`, `WhStatus`, `order`: the Tromsø *wh*-words, their status, and the word order of a
  monosyllabic *wh*-question.

## Main results

* `table_3_1_eq_required`, `danish_table_3_1`: Table 3.1 against the fragments.
* `nordmore_english_mirror`, `embedded_german_polar_all`: the mirror image and the two
  universals read off the fragments.
* `table_3_2`, `not_expresses_both`: the four cues separate the five grammars.
* `rows_consistent`: every judged word order in the data is consistent with its fragment.
* `isV2_order_iff`: a Tromsø monosyllabic *wh*-question is verb second iff its subject is new.

## Implementation notes

Westergaard's Fin⁰ and Wh⁰ heads are realized as the embedded root-like cells of Bhatt and
Dayal: German complementizer-less verb-second complements and Belfast English embedded
inversion are both `quasiSubordinated`, and her Wh⁰ is the yes/no cell her Belfast example
instantiates. Danish is the one variety whose table entry is not the fragment's required set,
since only some Danish exclamatives are verb second. The cues (57) and (60) for verb movement
to I°, which she motivates with Icelandic, the cue for English inflectional elements,
*som*-insertion, focus-sensitive adverbs, *kanskje*, and the acquisition chapters are not
formalized; the Tromsø rows have no fragment and enter only the *wh*-word model.
