# Kehler and Rohde (2013): A Probabilistic Reconciliation of Coherence-Driven and Centering-Driven Theories of Pronoun Interpretation

This file formalizes the Bayesian model of pronoun interpretation of [kehler-rohde-2013]: the
interpreter's bias `P(referent | pronoun)` is proportional to the speaker's production bias
`P(pronoun | referent)` times the next-mention prior `P(referent)` (the paper's (11) and (13)),
the prior is the mixture of the relation-conditioned biases weighted by the expected coherence
relations ((9)), and coherence expectations are in turn the mixture over the referent mentioned
next ((12)). The consequences the paper draws are proved once: a shift in the expected relations
with the conditional biases held fixed shifts the prior (`mixture_sub`), and only then
(`mixture_const`); a referent pronominalized above the overall rate is the pronoun's referent
above its prior, the overlaid subject bias (`posterior_gt_iff`); and raising a referent's
next-mention probability raises the expectation of the relations that favor it
(`relationExpectation_sub`).

The paper's passage-completion results (Tables 1–10, `Data/Experiments/KehlerRohde2013`) then
instantiate the model. The instruction manipulation's mixtures computed from Tables 3 and 4 fall
on the sides of chance Table 5 observes (`instruction_mixtures`); the pronoun prompt raises
subject mentions and shifts the continuations toward the Source-biased relations (Table 6); the
voice manipulation's Bayesian predictions computed from Tables 7 and 9 favor the subject in both
voices, more in the active, as Table 10 observes (`voice_predictions`), though below the
predictions Table 10 prints (`bayesSubject_lt_predicted`); and the pronominalization
rates of Table 9 increase with topichood, the passive subject above the active subject above the
non-subjects, a gradient the backward-looking center of a grammatical-role Centering cannot see
(`cb_topichood_dissociation_under_voice`).

## Implementation notes

The tables are `Data/Experiments/KehlerRohde2013`, whose proportions are printed to two places
and read here in percent (`Decimal.hundredths`); computed quantities are compared through their
integer numerators. The mixtures (9) range over the five relations the paper codes, whose
frequencies fall short of one by the continuations coded otherwise.
