# Breheny, Klinedinst, Romoli and Sudo (2018): the symmetry problem

[breheny-et-al-2018] survey the symmetry problem for the alternatives of scalar implicature: an
assertion `S` implicating `¬A` must have `A` among its alternatives but not `S ∧ ¬A`, which
would implicate the opposite. On the structural approach of [katzir-2007] and
[fox-katzir-2011] the alternatives negated are a contextual subset `C` of the formal
alternatives `F(S)` obeying the closure condition (8): `S ∈ C`, and every formal alternative in
the Boolean closure of `C` is in `C`. That condition is [trinh-haida-2015]'s (27), the sibling
study's `TrinhHaida2015.IsDomain`, and the implicatures are computed by innocent exclusion,
`Exhaustification.exhIE`, of which the paper's (9) is the simplification its footnote 7
describes. The paper's arguments then all have one shape: some formal alternative is the
negation, or the symmetric partner, of the alternative the inference needs, closure puts it into
every domain holding the other (`IsDomain.compl_mem`, `IsDomain.mem_of_isSymmetric`), and
neither can be innocently excluded, since negating both contradicts the assertion
(`Exhaustification.not_isInnocentlyExcludable_of_subset_union`); the study's
`exhIE_eq_self_of_isDomain` is that shape.

* Indirect implicatures, (12)–(15), after [romoli-2013]: *some* is derived from *not all* by
  (15), it is the negation of the needed *not any*, and exhaustification is vacuous on every
  domain (`exhIE_indirect_eq_self`); the Atomicity Constraint of [trinh-haida-2015] removes
  *some*, (22), and the implicature follows (`exhIE_indirect_atomicity`).
* Particularised implicatures, (28)–(31): with the conjunction of (18) split across sentences,
  the salient constituents yield only *smoke* and *not smoke*, and no domain licenses any
  inference (`exhIE_split_eq_self`); ignoring the salient *didn't smoke* derives the opposite
  one, footnote 16 (`exhIE_split_ignored`).
* Gradable adjectives, (32)–(40): Atomicity blocks *empty* but not *not empty*, so `{¬full,
  ¬empty}` is a domain (`isDomain_notFull_notEmpty`) on which exhaustification derives the
  unattested *the glass is empty* (`exhIE_notFull_notEmpty`); without Atomicity, *empty* joins
  every domain holding *not empty* and neither inference arises (`exhIE_notFull_eq_self`). The
  observed inference is available through the modifier alternatives of (37), *not half full*
  in place of *not empty* (`isDomain_notFull_notHalf`, `exhIE_notFull_notHalf`), but keeping
  both leaves exhaustification vacuous, footnote 20 (`exhIE_adjectiveAlts_eq_self`), and (38)
  shows the modifier route overgenerating for *safe*, *tall*, and *transparent*, adjectives of
  every scale structure in [kennedy-2007]'s sense.
* Lexicalised symmetric partners, (44)–(45), after [swanson-2010]: *required* and *optional*
  partition *permitted* and are lexical items of the same complexity, so both are formal
  alternatives, every domain holding one holds the other, and exhaustification is vacuous
  (`exhIE_permitted_eq_self`).

Section 4.1's problem of too few lexical alternatives, the Japanese deontic paradigm
(41)–(43) in which necessity is a negated verbal stem or an existential construction and yet
*yoi* 'allowed' implicates *not required*, and Section 5's assessment of the cost-and-
informativity account of [bergen-levy-goodman-2016], which covers (46), (48), and (50) and
fails (54)–(58), are recorded as rows and prose: the paper concludes that no account solves
the problem in full generality.

## Implementation notes

Sentences are propositions `Set W` over an arbitrary set of worlds, in the paper's schematic
notation (*¬all*, *some*, *run ∧ ¬smoke*); the relations the paper assumes among them (that
no glass is both half filled and empty) are hypotheses, and the worlds of the paper's
partitions (none, some but not all; empty, a bit filled, half filled) are witnesses. Which
sentences are formal alternatives is taken from the paper's sets (14), (19), (31), and (37),
not derived from a lexicon; that *some* is not derivable from *not all* under Atomicity is
`TrinhHaida2015.atoms_mem_source`, and (18) itself is `TrinhHaida2015.exhIE_run_smoke` on the
domain `TrinhHaida2015.run_smoke_isDomain`. The examples are the rows of `Examples.all`.

## TODO

* Section 5.1.2's argument that alternatives of equal cost and equal relative informativity
  leave the listener undecided is an invariance of `RSA.pragmaticListener` under an involution
  of worlds and utterances that preserves meaning and cost and fixes the assertion; the paper's
  hypothetical of a *just some* no costlier than *all* and its cases (54)–(58) await that
  theorem.
