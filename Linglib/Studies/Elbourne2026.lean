# Elbourne (2026): Adjectives without syntactic categories

Elbourne's ⟨et,et⟩ theory gives every adjective the type of a function from noun meanings to noun
meanings, the type of Parsons and Lewis, so that an adjective combines with its noun by
functional application and no rule of predicate modification is needed. In predicative position
a copula applies the adjective to the trivial noun and quantifies over a time in the tense
relation, and a second meaning of the indefinite article gives *a dog* the same type. Adjectives
that never stand alone in predicative position, such as *former*, bear a compulsory selector
feature that the copula cannot select for. The relational *local*, the scope contrast of
*young alleged murderer*, and gradable adjectives under a positive morpheme all stay within the
type.

## Main statements

* `intersective_apply_time`: at each time an intersective adjective is the meet with the noun,
  so predicate modification is not needed.
* `fido_was_cute`, `fido_is_a_dog`, `john_was_a_former_judge`: predicative sentences.
* `former_isPrivative`, `intersective_ne_former`: *former* is privative, so the ⟨e,t⟩ theory,
  whose predicate modification is intersective, cannot express it.
* `rows_licensed`: the selector features decide which positions an adjective appears in.
* `exists_inner_not_committed`, `pos_gradable`: the scope contrast and gradable adjectives stay
  within the type.

## Implementation notes

* The carrier is the substrate's `Modifier (Property I E)`, `Property I E := I → E → Prop` with
  times first, where the article's `⟨e,it⟩` takes the entity first; conjuncts are likewise
  reordered. An intersective adjective is `Modifier.intersective Q`, meet with the property `Q`,
  and the article's second meaning of the indefinite article (32) is that same function, so
  *a dog* is `Modifier.intersective dog`.
* The syntax of §2 is represented only by the optional/compulsory distinction among selector
  features of (8), on which the attributive/predicative distribution rests; Predicate
  Abstraction and traces are Lean binders, and the meanings composed in §2.3 and §3.5 are
  stated with the article's truth conditions. The thematic relations and culmination function of
  (8) are the fields of `Frame`.
* The examples are `Data.Examples.Elbourne2026`.

/-- Applying the intersective *cute*, `λf⟨e,it⟩.λx.λt.f(x)(t) & cute(x)(t)`, to *donkey* gives
`λx.λt.donkey(x)(t) & cute(x)(t)` (24)–(26), which at each time is the meet of the two extensions.
That meet is predicate modification, so the ⟨e,t⟩ theory's rule is not needed. -/

the adjective to the trivial noun at a time that the tense relation `R` locates. -/

`λf⟨e,it⟩.λg⟨e,it⟩.λx.λt.g(x)(t) & f(x)(t)`, is `Modifier.intersective`, so *a dog* has the type
of an adjective and the copula can take it. -/

both the positive and the negative condition. -/

/-- *localᵢ* (54) denotes `λf⟨e,it⟩.λx.λt.f(x)(t) & local(x)(σ(i))(t)`. The relatum `z` is the

taking an internal argument. -/
