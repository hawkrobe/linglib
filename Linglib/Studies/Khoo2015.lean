# Khoo (2015): Modal Disagreements

This file records the experiment of [khoo-2015] on disagreements over epistemic modal claims.
Participants read a control vignette with a non-modal assertion and a modal vignette in which
Smith, having examined evidence consistent with Fat Tony's death, says *Fat Tony might be dead*
while Beth knows him to be alive, and rated on a seven-point scale either whether what the
speaker said is false or whether they would respond *No, ...* (section II;
`Data/Examples/Khoo2015`). The Difference Observation is that the modal claim is rejected
readily yet not judged false, a dissociation the control assertion lacks
(`difference_observation`): speakers reject the might-claim without judging it false.

## Implementation notes

The cell means and standard deviations of footnote 13 are `Data.Experiments.Khoo2015`, which
the released survey reproduces; "readily" and "not" are read against the scale's midpoint. The
paper's account of the observation is not formalized.
