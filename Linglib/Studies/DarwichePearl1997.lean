# Darwiche and Pearl, on the logic of iterated belief revision (1997)

The AGM postulates constrain a single revision of a belief set and leave the agent's
conditional beliefs, its disposition to revise, almost unconstrained, so an AGM-compatible
operator may drop a conditional belief because the observation that would have triggered it
arrived (an animal seen to fly is no longer believed to fly should it be a bird) or acquire
one (a lady believed smart and rich is no longer believed rich once evidence against her
smartness is overturned). The paper moves revision to epistemic states, weakens the postulate
of syntax-irrelevance accordingly, since two states with the same beliefs may revise
differently (two jurors who both believe A guilty but rank B and C differently), and adds four
postulates: revising by a weaker proposition before a stronger one is redundant (C1), by a
contradicted one is overridden (C2), evidence implied by later evidence is retained (C3), and
evidence not contradicted by later evidence stays uncontradicted (C4). Each is equivalent to a
condition on the faithful total preorders that represent the operator, Spohn's
conditionalisation satisfies them all, and Boutilier's stronger postulate, minimising every
change of conditional belief, forgets a colour observation once the animal's species is
corrected. Four partial operators in the appendix show that the AGM postulates entail none of
C1–C4, and an operator that moves the disbelieved worlds of rank two or more down rather than
up satisfies C1 but neither C3 nor C4.

The framework and its theorems are in `Logic/BeliefRevision/Iterated.lean`; here the paper's
examples and appendix tables are checked against them.

## Implementation notes

* The worlds of an appendix table are the valuations of its two propositions, so a
  proposition is a set of pairs of Booleans, `first` and `second` naming the two.
* A table gives only the preorders before and after one revision; its compatibility with the
  postulates is that the revised belief worlds are the least evidence-worlds of the prior.
