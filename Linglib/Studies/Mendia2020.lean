# Mendia (2020): Reference to ad hoc kinds

Mendia analyzes kind reference through partitions. Carlson's Disjointness Condition, that a
kind-referring expression ranges over subkinds sharing no realizations and jointly covering the
kind, becomes the requirement that kind reference go through a partition of the kind's
realizations into the cells of a contextually salient equivalence relation. Subkinds are referred
to through the ι of the cells, and an ad hoc kind term such as *the lions that eat people* is the
ι of κ+, the cells that contain every instance of the restrictor. Mendia's indistinguishability
relation is Cresswell's degree construction, so an amount reading of a relative clause is the
same definite under the partition of a preorder into its degrees.

## Main statements

* `ncard_realized_classes_le`: under any partition, finitely many individuals realize at most as
  many subkinds as there are individuals, so *two kinds of dog are sitting in the next room* is
  false with only Fido there.
* `the_kappaPlus_eq_some`, `the_kappaPlus_eq_none`: the ad hoc kind term refers exactly when the
  restrictor's instances share a cell.
* `amount_reading`: an amount reading refers to the degree of the restrictor's instances.

## Implementation notes

* The model is extensional. The type `E` collects the realizations of the kind under
  discussion, a salient kind formation is a `Setoid E`, the partition Π of (28) is its
  `Setoid.classes`, and a subkind is identified with its cell, as the paper does for its tables
  (p. 616: the members of a partition "are always objects, not kinds").
* (28b) as printed binds `y_k` in the antecedent and uses it in the consequent; it is read with
  `y_k` bound outside the implication. (33) prints `Π(x_y)` for `Π(x_k)`.
* The ι of (31) and (36) is `Reference.iota`, undefined when no cell or several qualify.
* Dogs come in every combination of breed and role and lions in every combination of subspecies
  and diet, so there are people-eating lions of both subspecies. The restrictor *lions that eat
  people* is read as footnote 11's *lions that eat only people*, a value of the diet.

## TODO

* The champagne partitions (64)–(66) of §4.3.2, the distribution of ad hoc kind terms (§3.3),
  the singular–plural contrast (§3.4), and the amount readings without degrees of §5.

## References

* [mendia-2020]
