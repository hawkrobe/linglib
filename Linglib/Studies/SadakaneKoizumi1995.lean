# Sadakane and Koizumi (1995)

Japanese particles after a noun phrase divide into case markers, which cliticize onto the noun
phrase, and postpositions, which head a phrase over it. The particle *ni* seems to behave as both.
Sadakane and Koizumi argue that it is four homophonous particles: the dative case marker, a
postposition, the *ni* inserted on a caseless subject, and a form of the copula. Three tests
separate them, a floating numeral quantifier and a cleft with and without the particle. The uses
of *ni* that pass all three are ambiguous between the case marker and the postposition, and the
paper ties the choice between the two to how affected the referent of the noun phrase is.

## Main definitions

* `Attachment`: whether a particle cliticizes onto its noun phrase or heads a phrase over it.
* `Particle`, `Test`, `Particle.Passes`: the four classes of particle, the three tests, and which
  classes pass which tests.
* `Position`: the argument positions of the affectedness hierarchy (45).

## Main statements

* `Attachment.hostsQuantifier_iff`: a numeral quantifier and its host c-command each other exactly
  when the particle cliticizes.
* `Particle.passes_caseMarker`, `Particle.passes_postposition`, `Particle.passes_insertion`,
  `Particle.not_passes_copula`: the tables (14), (29) and (32).
* `exists_passes_and_exists_passes_iff`: a use of *ni* passing both of the first two tests is
  ambiguous between the case marker and the postposition.
* `judgment_eq_acceptable_iff`: every test example is acceptable exactly when its particle passes
  the test.
* `judgment_eq_acceptable_iff_affected`: a floating quantifier goes with a *ni* phrase exactly when
  its referent may be affected.
* `Position.lt_iff_cCommands`: the hierarchy (45) orders the arguments of Koizumi's tree (44) by
  c-command.

## Implementation notes

* A test is passed when the paper marks it OK without qualification, so the postposition's cleft
  without the particle, `*/?/OK` in (14), fails. An example printed with two marks records the
  first as its judgment and the second as `alsoJudged`.
* The cleft with the particle follows Nakayama's account, which the paper offers for concreteness
  without adopting it.
* Martin's 31 uses of *ni* are the `category` labels of the examples, and the class the paper
  assigns each is a `particle` label, two for an ambiguous use.
* The judgments are those of the innovating variety (note 9). Morii's acquisition study, which
  the paper reports, is not formalized.
