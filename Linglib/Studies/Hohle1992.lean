# Höhle (1992): Über Verum-Fokus im Deutschen

This file formalizes [hohle-1992]'s analysis of *verum focus*: the accent on a German finite
verb in initial position, or on a subordinating particle such as *daß*, that highlights a meaning
element VERUM paraphrasable as "it is true that", as in *Karl SCHREIBT ein Drehbuch* replying to
the claim that Karl is writing a screenplay. The paper's argument runs from assumption (13), that
VERUM is assigned to the accented word and highlighted as a semantic focus, to a rejection of the
reading of VERUM as an illocution-type operator: verum focus occurs in embedded verb-second
clauses and on complementizers, and in *er HÖRT ihr nicht zu* VERUM lies in the scope of the
negation, so it must be a truth predicate whose scope follows from the syntax.

The scope rule (60) lets the meaning element of a constituent `K₁` lie in the scope of that of
`K₂` iff `K₁` stands in a structural relation SR to `K₂`; `SR` reads it as c-command with
reconstruction of a fronted finite verb to its trace. On the peripheral structure of (76), a
clause `[Φ Π]` whose position Φ is filled by a complementizer or by a finite verb binding a trace
in Π, the negation in Π c-commands the verb's trace but not Φ, so `Scoping.negOverVerum` is
admissible for verum focus on the finite verb and not for verum focus on *daß*. The felicity
condition is that the background thought, the argument of VERUM, is known from the context
(`Appropriate`); this derives the contrast of (55): after *ich hoffe, daß Karl ihr zuhört*, the
verb-second reply is appropriate and the *daß* reply is not. `IntroducesVerum` is the
non-segmental rule (97) of the final section, which introduces VERUM over any bare Π next to a
non-empty sister; it decides which accents yield verum focus across complementizers, fronted
verbs, relative and interrogative pronouns without a particle, and verb-final verbs.

## Implementation notes

* Clauses are `Syntax.Tree`s over the labels of (76) and (97), with Π flat inside; the trace
  bindings that reconstruction respects are given as an explicit list, footnote 7's
  pseudo-reconstruction, and Höhle's relation SR is left open in the paper.
* VERUM is the identity on propositions, so the two scopings of (56) have the same content
  (`content_focusBackground`) and differ only in what is background.
* "Known from the context" is membership in the salient set of a `HighlightingContext`; the
  question under discussion plays no role.
* The assumption of §7 that there is no verum focus on a verb-final finite verb, and the
  copula and full-verb judgments of (71) and (72), are recorded in the example rows only.
