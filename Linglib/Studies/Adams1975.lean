# Adams (1975): The Logic of Conditionals: An Application of Probability to Deductive Logic

Adams asks when an inference is probabilistically sound: when making the premises certain enough
makes the conclusion as certain as one likes. A factual formula's probability is the probability
that it is true, and an indicative conditional's is the conditional probability of its consequent
given its antecedent. For factual formulas the answer is classical: such an inference is
probabilistically sound exactly when it is logically valid, and then the conclusion's
uncertainty, its probability of being false, is at most the sum of the premises'. For
conditionals the two part ways. Contraposition, the inference of a conditional from a
disjunction, the hypothetical syllogism and the strengthening of an antecedent are valid for the
material conditional but not probabilistically sound, which is why the English inferences Adams
prints are unacceptable; what p-entailment does satisfy is the rules for conditionals of his
natural deduction system.

## Main results

* `tfae_pEntails`: for factual formulas, logical consequence, p-entailment, the uncertainty bound
  under every probability, and the preservation of certainty coincide.
* `isPreferential_pEntails`: p-entailment from a set of conditionals is closed under the rules
  for conditionals of Adams's natural deduction system.
* `materially_valid_not_pEntailed`, `printed_inferences`: the patterns of conditional inference
  Adams examines are valid for the material conditional but not p-entailed, and the English
  inferences he prints are unacceptable instances of them.
* `not_isRational_pEntails`: unlike the closest-worlds conditional on a total order,
  p-entailment does not validate rational monotonicity.

## Implementation notes

* Possible states of affairs form a measurable space, a formula is the set of states where it is
  true, and a probability-assignment is a probability measure, after Adams's assumption that a
  proposition's probability is the measure of the states in which it is true. His assignments
  are finitely additive on formulas; over finitely many atoms these are the measures on truth
  assignments, and beyond that countable additivity is an added assumption.
* Every formula is a conditional `Formula`, a factual one having a tautological antecedent, as
  rule R1 makes them interderivable; an assignment is proper when it gives each antecedent
  positive probability. Uncertainty, probability of falsity, is stated directly as `μ Aᶜ`.
* The natural deduction rules are proved on a discrete space, where every set of states is an
  event, as for the finite sentential languages Adams considers.

## TODO

* The completeness half of Theorem 4.2, that the rules derive every p-entailed conditional, and
  Theorem 3.3 for conditional premises, that a p-consistent set p-entails only conclusions whose
  material counterparts its own entail.
