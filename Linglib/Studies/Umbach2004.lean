# Umbach (2004): On the Notion of Contrast in Information Structure and Discourse Structure

This file formalizes [umbach-2004]'s decomposition of contrast. The alternatives a focus evokes
must be comparable, similar and dissimilar at once: following [lang-1984]'s conditions on
coordination, no alternative subsumes another, `SemanticallyIndependent`, and a common
integrator subsumes them all, `CommonIntegrator`, together `WellFormedAlts`, which rules out
*drink* beside *martini*, (9a) and (10a), `not_wellFormedAlts_of_subset`, and keeps the singular
individuals out of the alternatives of a focused coordination, Krifka's problem. This is the
contrast of any focus, in the sense of [rooth-1992]. A contrastive focus in the sense of
[chafe-1976] and [kiss-1998] adds exclusion, of which there are two varieties with different
presuppositions, (14): a contrastive focus presupposes that some alternative satisfies the
predicate and asserts that it is the focused one, excluding the others *instead of* it,
`instead`, whereas an *only*-phrase presupposes the focused alternative and excludes the others
*in addition to* it, `inAddition`, [horn-1969]. The two convey the same total content,
`instead_content_eq_inAddition_content`, and differ in what they presuppose,
`presupposition_inAddition_eq_assertion_instead`. In discourse, *but* is focus-sensitive, (16), and
answers a conjunctive question by confirming one part and denying the other, (17), the
confirm+deny condition, `ConfirmDeny`: such an answer resolves the conjunctive question,
`mem_polar_inf_polar_of_confirmDeny`, and its content is that of the corresponding
*only*-phrase, (19) and (20), `confirmDeny_content_eq_inAddition`. CONTRAST and CORRECTION,
(24) and (25), differ as the two exclusions do: the contrastive *but* excludes the second
alternative in addition to the first, `contrastBut`, the corrective *but*, German *sondern*,
excludes the first alternative instead of the second, `correctionBut`, with the same assertion
and different licensing contexts, `contrastBut_content_eq_correctionBut_content`,
`presupposition_contrastBut`, `presupposition_correctionBut`.

## Implementation notes

Alternatives are propositions, sets of worlds, and a predicate over a set of alternatives is a
function to propositions; the presupposition of a contrastive focus is taken in the strengthened
form of footnote 8, that exactly one alternative satisfies the predicate. The implicit question
of a *but*-sentence is the meet of the polar questions of its conjuncts, following
[roberts-1998]'s implicit questions. The double-contrast cases (22) and the *it*-cleft data are
recorded as rows only. The examples are the rows of `Data.Examples.Umbach2004`.

## TODO

Footnote 12 observes that the contrastive counterfactual (24c), read as a no-yes sequence,
presupposes the second conjunct and prefers the yes-no reading; `presupposition_contrastBut`
follows the main text.

whether or not the denied one does too. -/
