# Charlow (2019): Where is the destructive update problem?

This file formalizes [charlow-2019], "Where is the destructive update problem?", which argues
that overwriting the value an assignment gives a variable is not a problem peculiar to dynamic
semantics. In the dynamic system of [groenendijk-stokhof-1991] two indefinites with the same
index leave only the second as a discourse referent, the first update being destroyed, at no
cost to truth conditions. The static system overwrites assignments in the same way: a
superscripted expression is a scope-taker that evaluates its scope at a shifted assignment, and
the two systems differ only in the operator `↑` that closes off the part of a sentence that does
not care about assignments, the static one discarding the shifted assignment and the dynamic one
returning it. The dynamic `↑` is the test of the static one, so the two agree on truth.

What destructive update does cost is antisymmetry: an assignment reachable from another by some
formula reaches it back, reachability being the relation of differing at finitely many
variables. That is a problem only for a negation defined by descent along an order on points.
Over states of world-assignment pairs, the negation that tests each point is distributive
whatever its prejacent, which collapses negated possibility and negated necessity, and the one
that removes the surviving points fails once points are modified. Processing a state cell by
cell, a cell being its points with one assignment, gives a possibility modal and a negation that
are distributive over assignments and not over worlds, and the negation is the pointwise one on
the updates that only change assignments.

## Main definitions

* `sup`, `pro`, `upStatic`, `upDynamic`: the superscript, the pronoun, and the two operators `↑`.
* `reachable`: reachability of an assignment from another by a formula.
* `distNeg`, `descNeg`: the pointwise negation and the negation by descent.
* `Part`, `slice`, `IsAnaphoricallyDistributive`, `anaMight`, `anaNeg`: the cells of a state,
  processing a state cell by cell, and the possibility modal and negation defined that way.

## Main results

* `mem_indefinites_iff`: the second of two coindexed indefinites overwrites the first.
* `upDynamic_eq_test`, `nonempty_upDynamic_iff`: the dynamic `↑` is the test of the static one.
* `pollyAnnaStatic_eq`, `pollyAnnaDynamic_eq`: the static and the dynamic meaning of a sentence
  with two names competing for one index.
* `reachable_iff_finite`, `reachable_symm`, `antisymmetry_fails`: reachability is differing at
  finitely many variables, so it is symmetric and no partial order.
* `isDistributive_distNeg`, `distNeg_might_eq_distNeg_must`: the pointwise negation is
  distributive and conflates the two modals.
* `isAnaphoricallyDistributive_slice`, `not_isDistributive_anaMight`, `anaNeg_image`: slicing is
  distributive over assignments only, and its negation is pointwise on anaphoric updates.

## Implementation notes

A dynamic proposition is an `Update (Assignment E)`, the paper's functions from assignments to
sets of assignments uncurried; the operators of the modular analysis are stated in the paper's
curried form, with `upDynamic_eq_test` relating the two. The paper's cells are the maximal
subsets of a state with one assignment, which are the nonempty fibres of the projection to
assignments. Descent needs an order on assignments, which total assignments do not have, so
`descNeg` is stated over any preordered type of anaphoric contexts.
