# Pickering and Barry (1991): Sentence Processing without Empty Categories

This file formalizes [pickering-barry-1991]'s argument that the processing of an unbounded
dependency associates the filler directly with its subcategoriser and never with an empty
category. An analysis with empty categories makes two associations per dependency, filler to
gap and gap to verb; the gap-free analysis makes one, filler to verb. Each association spans an
interval of the sentence, a pattern of associations is nested when one association lies strictly
inside another (abba) and disjoint when none overlap (aabb), and nested associations are the
ones that must be held open while others are formed.

Under the analysis with empty categories neither pattern lines up with nested constructions in
Chomsky's sense or with the judgments (Table 1): the multiple pied-piping sentence (42) has
nested filler–gap and nested gap–verb associations yet is as easy as the multiple subject
relative. Under the gap-free analysis the one pattern coincides with nestedness in Chomsky's
sense (Table 2) and with the judgments (`table1`, `table2`, `difficulty`,
`trace_prediction_fails`), and it stays disjoint however far the pied-piping and the recursive
passive are extended, where the empty-category analysis holds every filler to the end of the
sentence (`peripheralGaps_fillerVerb_disjoint`, `peripheralGaps_fillerGap_common`). The
categorial grammar of the paper's later sections derives the embedded questions (82a–c) with no
empty category (`der82a`, `der82b`, `der82c`), and (82d) has no derivation because the pronoun
must fill an argument role of the embedded verb, which is the count invariant of
[van-benthem-1986] (`no_der82d`).

## Implementation notes

Associations are spans between word positions of the paper's annotated strings, empty
categories included; a nested construction in Chomsky's sense is the same relation on the
lexical spans of the relative clauses, which is where the paper's removal of "nonnull" from
the definition shows up. The paper's rule (80a), which combines a subject with a transitive verb
before its object, is the composition of the subject's raised category with the verb, so the
lexicon carries the raised entry, as in `Syntax/CCG/Derivation`. The semantic side of the
derivations and the discussion of incremental interpretation are not formalized.
