# Sag (2010): English Filler-Gap Constructions

This file formalizes the paper's account of the five English filler-gap clauses, topicalized,
wh-exclamative, nonsubject wh-interrogative, wh-relative and the-clauses, as constructions of
Sign-Based Construction Grammar. The clauses share the filler-head construction, which binds a
nonverbal filler to a gap in a verbal head daughter, and each cross-classifies with a clausal
type that fixes its semantic type; what remains to each is a short list of constraints, from
which the paper's parameters of variation follow: which distinguished element the filler must
contain, which categories the filler and head daughters may have, whether the head may or must
be inverted or infinitival, whether the clause is an island, and whether it must be independent.

A construct is described by the categories of its daughters and the inversion, finiteness and
independence of its head (`Construct`), and a clause licenses the constructs meeting its
constraints (`FGClause.Licenses`), with categories compared in the sort order of the RSRL
construct hierarchy of `Syntax/HPSG/Construction`. Islandhood and semantics are facts of that
hierarchy's grammar: a clause is an absolute island when the grammar rejects a construct of its
sort with a second, undischarged gap (`FGClause.IsIsland`), and a construct is well formed
exactly when its mother has the semantic type of the clausal supertype. The distinguished
element is lexical: the wh-word inventory is read off the paper's judgment triples (`occurs`),
and no wh-form of any category occurs in all three wh-constructions (`no_universal_wh_word`).
The rows are the paper's examples, and their judgments follow from the constructions
(`judgments`).

## Implementation notes

The WH, REL, IC and VFORM features of the constructions are not in the RSRL signature, so the
constraints on them are stated over `Construct` rather than checked by the model theory, while
the category, GAP and SEM constraints are the grammar's. Independence is identified with the
absence of embedding, so the embedded topicalizations the paper licenses under predicates that
admit main-clause phenomena are not among the rows. The inventory is derived from the judgment
triples rather than transcribed from the paper's table of wh-words, which prints two cells
differently: bare *what* in exclamatives and determiner *which* in relatives are marked as
accepted by some speakers in the table but starred in the triples. The island rows are checked
in one direction, since the paper attributes the graded degradation of extraction from finite
wh-interrogatives to processing.

## TODO

* The paper stars its example of a the-clause with a complementizer head although its text
  admits an S or CP head; the row is omitted.
