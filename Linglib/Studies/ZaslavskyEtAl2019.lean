# Zaslavsky et al. (2019): Color Naming Reflects Both Perceptual Structure and Communicative Need

This file formalizes [zaslavsky-etal-2019]'s information-theoretic link between communicative
need and communicative precision in color naming. A language's color naming distribution
`p(w | c)` is a channel `κ : Kernel C W` from colors to words and a need distribution is a prior
`μ` over colors. The expected surprisal `S(c)` of a color (eq. 1) is the surprisal of the color
to a listener who hears its name and inverts the lexicon by Bayes' rule (eq. 2), the measure of
communicative imprecision with which [gibson-etal-2017] found warm colors named more precisely
than cool ones. The capacity of the lexicon (eqs. 3 and 4) is `channelCapacity κ`, and the
paper's central observation is that the need distributions attaining it are those with
`p(c) ∝ exp(−S(c))` (eq. 5, `capacityAchieving_iff`), so that `−log p(c)` is linear in `S(c)`
with slope one (eq. 6, `neg_log_eq_add_channelCapacity`). The intercept `log Z` of eq. 6 is the
capacity itself.

The divergence of the row `κ c` from the word marginal is `−S(c) − log p(c)`
(`toReal_klDiv_eq`), so eq. 5 is the divergence condition of `InformationTheory`'s capacity
theorems: sufficiency (`measureMutualInfo_compProd_eq_channelCapacity`) and necessity at a prior
of positive mass everywhere (`toReal_klDiv_eq_channelCapacity`).

The artificial naming systems obtained by clustering the chips in perceptual space are
deterministic channels (`ofPartition`). Under a uniform need the surprisal of a color is the log
size of its cluster (`expectedSurprisal_ofPartition_uniformOn`), so that their warm–cool
asymmetry is an asymmetry in cluster size (`warmCoolAsymmetry_ofPartition_uniformOn_iff`). The
prior spreading mass equally over clusters (`clusterPrior`) is capacity-achieving
(`capacityAchieving_clusterPrior`) and the capacity of a `k`-term clustering system is `log k`
(`channelCapacity_ofPartition`). The universal need distribution inferred from the World Color
Survey averages the per-language capacity-achieving priors (eq. 7), which are the least
informative priors of [zaslavsky-kemp-regier-tishby-2018] (`isLeastInformative_iff`).

## Implementation notes

* The paper states eq. 5 as necessary and sufficient for a prior to be capacity-achieving.
  `capacityAchieving_iff` states it with the positivity that eq. 5 itself entails: a need
  distribution satisfies eq. 5 exactly when it is capacity-achieving and gives every color
  positive mass. A capacity-achieving prior may leave a color unused, and eq. 5 then fails.
* Every prior giving the clusters of a clustering system equal mass satisfies eq. 5, so the
  capacity-achieving prior of such a system is not unique; `clusterPrior` is the one uniform
  within each cluster.
* The perceptual coordinates of the chips and the `k`-means procedure are not represented; a
  clustering enters only through its assignment of chips to terms. The survey data that
  instantiate `WarmCoolAsymmetry` are not in the library.
