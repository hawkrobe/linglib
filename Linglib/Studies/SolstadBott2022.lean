# Solstad & Bott (2022): On the Nature of Implicit Causality and Consequentiality

This file formalizes the Two-Mechanism Account of [solstad-bott-2022]. Implicit causality
(I-Caus), the coreference bias of a continuation after *because*, is verb-semantic: on the
authors' Empty Slot Theory, a stimulus argument causes the psychological state the verb
names without the verb saying how, so the argument carries an underspecified proposition
that an explanation fills. Implicit consequentiality (I-Cons), the bias after *and so*, is
discourse-structural: on the Contiguity Principle of [kehler-2002], a consequence continues
from the final state of the prompt's eventuality, held by the experiencer of the state or by
the participant the action affects. Both mechanisms read off a verb class's proto-role grid
([dowty-1991]): `CarriesSlot` is the stimulus label, `HoldsEndState` the experiencer label or
causal affectedness, `ICaus` and `ICons` the resulting coreference predictions, and `Bias`
routes them through the direction of the cause–effect relation a connective signals.

The rival One-Mechanism Account of [crinean-garnham-2006] reads both biases off one causal
decomposition, causes with agents and stimuli alike, consequences with experiencers and
patients, so a continuation about the end-state argument should be a consequence. The
Two-Mechanism Account lets slot filling take precedence over contiguity, so a slot predicate
is continued by an explanation whichever argument the continuation is about. `oneMechanism`
and `twoMechanism` state the two coherence predictions; they agree on the slot argument and
diverge exactly on the end-state argument of a slot predicate, the paper's Asymmetry
Hypothesis. The accounts also part on agent-patient verbs, whose agent is a cause on the
One-Mechanism reading but carries no slot, since it causes by the very action the verb names.

Four sentence-continuation experiments on German stimulus-experiencer (*ärgern*) and
experiencer-stimulus (*bewundern*) verbs test the hypothesis. Experiment 1 confirms the mirror
coreference biases: after *weil* the stimulus argument, after *sodass* the experiencer, with the
two per-verb biases almost perfectly anticorrelated. Experiment 2 (full stop) finds
explanations the most frequent relation for both classes, about three times as frequent as
consequences. Experiment 3 (forced reference) finds explanations at least as frequent as
consequences even when the continuation is forced onto the I-Cons argument, against the
One-Mechanism symmetry. Experiment 4 finds explanatory specifications, continuations giving
the direct cause of the psychological state, almost only in I-Caus-congruent explanations,
and consequence specifications, restatements of the experiencer's state, essentially never:
consequences introduce an eventuality subsequent to the prompt's, as contiguity predicts.

## Implementation notes

The experimental results are reported in prose above; the library's format for
experimental data is pending. The psych grids are the substrate's `psychCausal` and
`psychState`, which are each other's `flip`, so the mirror theorem is one instance of
`bias_flip`. The agent-evocator grid `judgment` follows the paper's description of
[crinean-garnham-2006]: the evocator is causally affected by the agent's act and, through
the verb's presupposition of a preceding eventuality it took part in, the non-agentive cause
of the agent's intention, so it is both the slot argument and the end-state argument.
Agent-patient verbs take the manner-contact grid `mannerContact`.
