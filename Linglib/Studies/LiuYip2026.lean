# Liu and Yip (2026): Again, finiteness, and split aspect in Chinese languages

This file formalizes the size-based account of finiteness and of exceptional scope in
Liu and Yip's paper. Verb complements in Mandarin and Cantonese come in three sizes, a finite CP, a
nonfinite TP and a nonfinite vP, and the two aspect projections of the split aspect approach
sit at fixed heights, the outer one at the level of T above vP and the inner one at the level
of v, so every complement contains inner aspect and only a TP or larger contains outer aspect
(`Contains`). An *again*-element or aspectual suffix associates with one of the two
projections, by movement for Mandarin preverbal *you* and by agreement for the suffixes, and
takes exceptional scope across a complement, skipping the matrix predicate or lowering onto it,
exactly when the complement has no projection of its kind to intervene, so that it
associates with the matrix one (`ExceptionalScope`). The paper's tables follow from that one
definition: outer-associated elements, Mandarin *you*, Cantonese *-faan* and the outer
aspectual suffixes, take exceptional scope across a vP and across nothing larger
(`exceptionalScope_outer_iff`); inner-associated elements, Mandarin *zai*, Cantonese *zoi* and
repetitive *-gwo*, the continuous *-zyu* and the phase complements, never do
(`not_exceptionalScope_inner`), which is the argument that vP is the minimal size of a nonfinite
clause; and transparency is downward closed along the size hierarchy
(`ExceptionalScope.anti`), the implicational complementation hierarchy of
Wurmbrand and Lohninger. Mandarin *you* alone carries the unvalued dynamic feature of
Lin and Liu and must be licensed by an outer aspect head bearing `[+D]`, which the paper's
selectional table for *xiang* 'want', *rang* 'let' and *xiangxin* 'believe' turns into the
embeddability of *you* (`Pred.embedsYou`) and into the blocking of aspect lowering by an embedded
*you* (`not_exceptionalScope_of_licensesDynamic`).

## Main definitions

* `AspProjection`, `AspProjection.level` — the outer and inner aspect projections of the split
  aspect approach and their heights in the functional sequence.
* `Contains`, `ExceptionalScope` — a complement size contains an aspect projection, and an
  element associated with it takes exceptional scope across it.
* `Again`, `Again.projection`, `Again.NeedsDynamic` — the six *again*-elements, the projection each
  associates with, and the dynamic feature of *you*.
* `aspectProjection`, `phaseComplementProjection` — the association of the Cantonese aspect suffixes
  and phase complements.
* `Pred.selects`, `Complement.LicensesDynamic`, `CPred.size` — the complements the Mandarin
  and Cantonese predicates select.

## Main results

* `exceptionalScope_outer_iff`, `not_exceptionalScope_inner`, `ExceptionalScope.anti` — the
  scope pattern by size and projection, and the implicational hierarchy.
* `generalization_I`, `generalization_II`, `correlation_I`, `correlation_II` — the Mandarin
  generalizations as consequences.
* `cantonese_lowering`, `aspect_lowering`, `no_phaseComplement_lowering` — the Cantonese
  pattern for the *again*-elements, the aspect suffixes and the phase complements.
* `embedsYou`, `not_exceptionalScope_of_licensesDynamic` — the licensing of *you* and its
  blocking of aspect lowering.

## Implementation notes

The two projections are the binary split of [travis-2010], [macdonald-2008], [tsai-2008] and
[sybesma-2017]; their heights are those of the functional sequence in
`Syntax/Minimalist/FunctionalSequence`, outer aspect at the level of T and inner aspect at the
level of v, so containment is a comparison of levels. Chomsky's defective intervention is not a
relation between heads: an embedded projection blocks association whatever its features, which
is the paper's claim. The semicomplementizer and Exfoliation, the restitutive reading, the
Italian parallel and the crosstype ambiguity of *dasuan* 'plan' are not represented.
