# Hayes and Wilson (2008): A Maximum Entropy Model of Phonotactics and Phonotactic Learning

This file formalizes Hayes and Wilson's maximum-entropy model of phonotactics. A constraint is a
sequence of feature matrices, one of which may be complemented, and a grammar assigns each form a
score, a maxent value, and a probability. The weights are learned by maximizing the probability
of the data, whose partial derivatives are differences between expected and observed violation
counts (`hasDerivAt_logLik`).

The grammar the learner found for English onsets (Table 4) is stated over the paper's feature
chart (Table 3), and every score the paper reports is recomputed from it (`rows_scores`),
including the ten attested onsets the grammar penalizes (`attested_penalized`). The predicted
rating orders forms as the score does (`rating_lt_iff`), so the reported correlation with
Scholes's ratings is a claim about the score alone.

## Implementation notes

Weights are kept in hundredths over `ℕ`, so every score is computed by `decide`; the maxent
value and probability then live over `ℝ`. Scores computed from the two-decimal weights of
Table 4 can differ from the paper's reported values by one hundredth ([ð] 4.53 here against
4.54; [θw] 3.90 against 3.91; [θ] and [θr] 1.84 against 1.85), and `rows_scores` states the
reproduction to within that rounding. Complement matrices are read against the
underspecified chart, so `[^+back]` contains every consonant unspecified for backness, as
#15 requires. The probability (6) over the infinite set of forms is realized over a finite
form space, the subtype of a candidate set for the learned grammar (`onsetProb`); the paper's
finite-state approximation of the expected counts is not modelled. The ratings of Scholes's
experiment appear only as a scattergram (Figure 3), so the correlation of 0.946 and Table 5 stay
in prose.

## TODO

* The constraint search of §4 (accuracy O/E with the upper confidence limit, generality, the
  algorithm (10)) and the Gaussian prior of footnote 4.
* Projections (§6–§7), the Shona and stress simulations, and Wargamay (§8).
