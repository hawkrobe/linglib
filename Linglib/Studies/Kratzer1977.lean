# Kratzer (1977): What 'must' and 'can' must and can mean

Kratzer reads *must* and *can* in view of a premise set as consequence and compatibility
(Definitions 5 and 6, the substrate's `simpleNecessity` and `simplePossibility`), and revises them
for inconsistent premise sets by quantifying over the consistent subsets (Definitions 7 and 8,
`MustInView` and `CanInView`). In a New Zealand whose whole common law is three judgments, that
murder is a crime and that deer are, and are not, personally responsible for the damage they
inflict on young trees, the revised definitions recover the verdicts the paper argues for:
murder must be a crime, while deer can be responsible and can fail to be. The recommendations of
the former principals of a Whare Wananga show that the verdicts depend on how premises are
individuated.

## Main statements

* `must_p`, `can_q`, `can_neg_q`: the revised verdicts on the New Zealand judgments.
* `not_must_q`, `must_q`: flying is required only when Te Miti's recommendation is two premises.
* `canInView_iff_not_mustInView_not`: the revised modals are dual.

## Implementation notes

* Each example's worlds are the four combinations of the two issues it turns on, and its
  premise set is the same at every world.
* Every premise but one looks at a single issue, so a world of a consistent subset can be moved
  along the other issue without leaving it; the verdicts are proved that way rather than by
  enumerating subsets.
* The paper's sentence numbers are those of the original article; the 2012 revision renumbers
  them.
