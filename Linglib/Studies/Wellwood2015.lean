# Wellwood (2015): On the Semantics of Comparison Across Categories

This file formalizes [wellwood-2015]'s hypothesis that nominal, verbal and adjectival
comparatives contain one degree-introducing morpheme, *much*, which denotes an
assignment-supplied measure function (7), while *-er* and *as* compare the measure of what
the base predicate applies to with the maximal degree of the than-clause ((27), (38);
[von-stechow-1984], [rullmann-1995]). The three domains then share one truth condition
(`comparativeTruth`), and the paper's step-by-step derivations of the nominal, verbal and
adjectival cases are one tree interpreted by the [heim-kratzer-1998] engine at three
lexical cells (`matrix_derivation_denotes`), differing only in the thematic role and in what
is measured: coffee, running events, or heat states (`nominalComparative`,
`verbalComparative`, `adjectivalComparative`). What *much* measures must be non-trivially
ordered by part-whole structure and measured monotonically (26): a quantized domain, that of
a singular count noun, a telic verb phrase or a non-gradable adjective, has no proper parts,
so every measure preserves its order vacuously and none separates anything, whereas a
cumulative domain with two satisfiers has a proper part
(`nontriviallyStructured_of_cum`). Which dimensions a comparative allows follows from what is
measured rather than from the category of the measuring word: a linearly ordered state
domain fixes the comparative ordering for every admissible measure, and a domain with
incomparable parts, like coffee by weight and volume, does not (`model_restricted_iff`).
The obligatory *much* of *very* with nouns and verbs and its absence with adjectives is
[bresnan-1973]'s Much Deletion (`very_much_deletion`).

## Implementation notes

Degrees are rationals and eventualities the `Event` type of the thematic substrate; the
engine's sorted domain is the sum of individuals and eventualities, and existential closure
is a lexical item. The order models of the measured domains are the reals for states and the
componentwise-ordered plane for entities and events. The bare-adjective, measure-phrase and
scalar-change discussions of the paper's objections section are not formalized.
