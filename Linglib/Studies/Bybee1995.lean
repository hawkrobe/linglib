# Bybee (1995): Regular morphology and the lexicon

This file formalizes [bybee-1995]'s network model of productivity, in which schemas emerge
over stored forms and the productivity of a schema is determined by two things: its type
frequency, the number of distinct forms instantiating it, and the openness of its variables.
Token frequency does the opposite work, strengthening an individual form's own entry. Over a
corpus of tokens, a schema's type frequency counts the distinct forms it relates and its token
frequency counts every occurrence (`typeFrequency_le_tokenFrequency`), and a more general
schema has the larger type frequency (`typeFrequency_mono`). What a schema generates depends
on the corpus only through its types, since the lexicon of its roles is the corpus's set of
types, so repetition of a stored form leaves its generative capacity unchanged. Openness is the
other determinant: a schema generates every instance whatever is stored exactly when all of
its variables are open (`Schema.isProductive_iff_forall_generates_iff`), which is what makes
the English past in *-ed* fully productive (`edSchema_isProductive`).

Schemas are product-oriented: generalizations over the derived forms themselves, not over
pairs of base and derived form. The class of *strung* is the shape of its past tenses, and the
dialectal new members *struck*, *snuck* and *drug* fit that shape (`struck_instantiates`) while
their bases lack the vowel a source-oriented pairing from *string* would demand
(`not_sourceOriented_pairs`), the finding of [bybee-moder-1983].

## Implementation notes

* A corpus is a multiset of forms; the lexicon of a schema's roles is its set of types.
* The counts of Table 8.1, the French conjugations children overgeneralize by type rather than
  token frequency, and the German participle and plural cases are not formalized.
