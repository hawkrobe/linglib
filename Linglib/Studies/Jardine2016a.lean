# Jardine (2016): Computationally, tone is different

Jardine argues that unbounded circumambient processes, whose application depends on material
unboundedly far away on both sides of the target, (2), are common in tonal phonology and rare in
segmental phonology. His witness is unbounded tonal plateauing, every TBU between two H-toned
TBUs surfacing H (Hyman and Katamba's rule, (7)), as the string map (36) of Section 4.1, which is
`Tone.utp`. The map is subsequential in neither direction (Section 4.2) but regular: the mark-up
decomposition (43), a left-to-right pass writing `?` after an H and a right-to-left pass
resolving it, is computed by a bimachine. Read back into autosegmental representations by (40),
the OCP-merged output is one H linked to the plateau (Section 4.4).

## Main results

* `utp_map_rows`: the map reproduces the plateaus of Section 2.2
* `utp_not_isSubsequential`: plateauing is subsequential in neither direction
* `utp_eq_resolve_mark`, `utp_isBimachineComputable`: the mark-up decomposition (43)

## Implementation notes

* The conjecture of Section 5.2, after Heinz and Lai, that plateauing has no mark-up-free
  decomposition and so is not weakly deterministic, is not stated.
* The rows write the paper's string representation one symbol per mora, a long vowel counting
  two; the Digo, Xhosa and Yaka data, whose plateaus interact with tone shift or an accentual
  analysis, are not encoded.

/-! ### The plateauing data

The paper's string representation of Section 4.1, one symbol per mora, `H` a TBU associated to a
H tone and Ø, written `O`, an unspecified one. -/

/-! ### UTP is not subsequential

By bounded delay: a left machine reading `H Øⁿ⁺¹` has emitted at most one symbol, since
`utp.map (H Øⁿ⁺¹) = H Øⁿ⁺¹` and `utp.map (H Øⁿ⁺¹ H) = Hⁿ⁺³` already differ at position `1`;
so it withholds `n + 1` symbols. -/

/-! ### The (43) mark-up decomposition

With one extra symbol the two-pass decomposition exists: a left pass marks every toneless
TBU after a H with `?`; a right pass resolves `?` by whether a H follows. The mark is
exactly the alphabet enlargement that Heinz and Lai's weak determinism disallows. -/

def resolveRight : Mealy Bool Mark TBU :=
  .ofFlag (· == .H) fun r a =>
    match a with | .H => .H | .O => .O | .Q => if r then .H else .O

/-- The (43) decomposition computes UTP, marking left-to-right and then resolving right-to-left.
Both passes run finite Mealy machines, so this exhibits UTP as a right-subsequential map
after a left-subsequential one (`Mealy.isLeftSubsequential`,
`Mealy.isRightSubsequential`). -/

/-- UTP is regular (§4.2). The (43) decomposition is a right-to-left Mealy pass after a
left-to-right one, and a bimachine computes such a composite, one deterministic pass per
direction. What fails above is one-directional determinism, not finite-state computability. -/

The string representation reads back into autosegmental representations by `TBU.toAR`
((40)); the OCP-merged representation of the output has one `H`, linked exactly to the
