# Rett (2015): The semantics of evaluativity

Rett derives the distribution of evaluativity across degree constructions, her Table 3.1, from two
Neo-Gricean implicatures. A Quantity implicature strengthens the otherwise tautological positive
construction, and the Marked Meaning Principle, after Horn's division of pragmatic labor, makes the
marked, negative antonym evaluative in exactly the polar-invariant constructions, the equatives
and degree questions in which its unmarked antonym has the same truth conditions.

## Main results

* `evaluative_iff_observed`: the implicature route, `implicature`, predicts every judgment of the
  table.
* `exact_equative_antonym_invariant`, `comparative_antonym_variant`: polar invariance grounded in
  the comparison semantics, the strengthened equatives of two antonyms being mutually entailing and
  their comparatives excluding each other.

## Implementation notes

Antonym polarity is the adjective's `Adjective.polarity`, which acts on the comparison of its
equative and comparative through the order dual, `Polarity.negative • c = c.dual`; negative antonyms
are the marked members of their pairs ([bierwisch-1989], [kennedy-2007]). The positive
construction and the measure phrase have no polarity-parametrized semantics in the substrate,
so their rows of `IsPolarInvariant` are the book's classification.

/-! ### Polar (in)variance and markedness -/

/-- A construction is polar-invariant, in Rett's sense, when the two antonyms yield the same truth
conditions in it, so that the marked antonym has an unmarked competitor. Equatives and degree
questions are polar-invariant; positives, comparatives, and measure phrases are not. -/

  | .positive | .comparative | .measurePhrase => False

/-! ### The implicature derivation -/

implicature (Chapter 5's Marked Meaning Principle). -/
inductive Implicature where
  | quantity
  | manner
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The implicature deriving evaluativity for a construction and antonym polarity, if any, is
Quantity for the positive construction with either antonym, and Manner, by the Marked Meaning
Principle, for the marked antonym of a polar-invariant construction. -/

  if c = .positive then some .quantity
  else if IsPolarInvariant c ∧ IsMarked p then some .manner else none

a polar-invariant construction. -/

/-! ### Polar variance grounded in the comparison semantics

[rett-2015] reduces polar (in)variance to mutual entailment of the antonyms' non-evaluative
readings: the strengthened ("exactly") equatives of the two antonyms share truth conditions,
so a truth-conditionally equivalent unmarked alternative exists and the Marked Meaning
Principle can fire; the antonym comparatives exclude each other, so no such alternative
exists. Degree questions pattern with the equative — both antonyms' true answers are the
subject's actual measure. -/
