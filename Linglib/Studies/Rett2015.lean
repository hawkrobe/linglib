# Rett (2015): The semantics of evaluativity

This file formalizes the book's derivation of the distribution of evaluativity across degree
constructions, its Table 3.1, from two Neo-Gricean implicatures. A Quantity implicature
strengthens the otherwise tautological positive construction, and the Marked Meaning
Principle, after [horn-1984]'s division of pragmatic labor, makes the marked, negative antonym
evaluative in exactly the polar-invariant constructions, `IsPolarInvariant`, the equatives and
degree questions in which its unmarked antonym has the same truth conditions. The route
deriving evaluativity for a construction and antonym polarity, if any, is `implicature`, and
`evaluative_iff_observed` checks its predictions against every judgment of the table. Polar
invariance is grounded in the comparison semantics: the strengthened equatives of two
antonyms are mutually entailing, `exact_equative_antonym_invariant`, while their comparatives
exclude each other, `comparative_antonym_variant`.

## Implementation notes

Antonym polarity is the adjective's `Adjective.polarity`, the `ScalePolarity` that
`Degree.equativeSem` and `Degree.comparativeSem` take as their direction; negative antonyms
are the marked members of their pairs ([bierwisch-1989], [kennedy-2007]). The positive
construction and the measure phrase have no polarity-parametrized semantics in the substrate,
so their rows of `IsPolarInvariant` are the book's classification.

same truth conditions, so the marked antonym has an unmarked competitor. Equatives and degree
questions are polar-invariant; positives, comparatives, and measure phrases are not. -/

/-! ### Polar variance grounded in the comparison semantics

[rett-2015] reduces polar (in)variance to mutual entailment of the antonyms' non-evaluative
readings: the strengthened ("exactly") equatives of the two antonyms share truth conditions,
so a truth-conditionally equivalent unmarked alternative exists and the Marked Meaning
Principle can fire; the antonym comparatives exclude each other, so no such alternative
exists. Degree questions pattern with the equative — both antonyms' true answers are the
subject's actual measure. -/
