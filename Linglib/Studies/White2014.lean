# White (2014): Factive-Implicatives and Modalized Complements

This file formalizes [white-2014]'s account of the factive-implicatives *remember* and
*forget*, factive with a finite complement and implicative with a control infinitive (1). The
verb is one item and always factive: the infinitival complement is headed by a modal
complementizer that contributes the presuppositional modality (`Modalized`), so
*remembered to take the trash out* presupposes that Bo had to, as *remembered that he had
to* does (7). The attitude is a Hintikkan quantifier over the worlds a memory event gives
access to (19), and the modal complementizer, unlike *that*, returns a property of events
(26). The Rule of Semantic Restructuring puts the two together, applying the attitude to the
property at the embedded event and summing that event with the attitude's into one compound
event (27) (`restructure`), which matrix aspect binds in the actual world (30). Implicative
entailments are then actuality entailments: a part of an actual compound event is actual, so
the remembered VP-event occurred (`actuality`), and with negation above aspect no actual
event is a remembering-to-VP (`negated_actuality`). A finite complement closes its own event
below the complementizer (23), (24), so the finite variant leaves the event's actuality open
(`exists_finite_not_actual`).

## Implementation notes

The attitude's memory relation and the modal's best worlds are accessibility relations with
event arguments ([kratzer-1996], [hacquard-2009]); the compound event is the join of its
parts, and actual events are closed under parts and joins. The step from an actual event
described as a VP-event in the accessible worlds to its being a VP-event in the actual world
is the hypothesis `EventDescriptionPreserved`, with events persisting into accessible worlds.
The *again* modification facts of the restructuring test and the coordination data are
recorded as examples only.
