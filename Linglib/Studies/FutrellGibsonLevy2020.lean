# Futrell, Gibson and Levy (2020): Lossy-Context Surprisal

This file formalizes [futrell-gibson-levy-2020]'s lossy-context surprisal, on which the
difficulty of a word is its expected surprisal under a lossy memory representation of its
context, carried by `Processing.LossyContext.MemoryProcess`. The comprehender of section 3.3
predicts the next word from its memory representation by Bayesian inversion of the memory
kernel (`bayes`), and averaged over contexts its difficulty is the conditional entropy of the
word given the representation, which exceeds the difficulty of surprisal theory, the lossless
comprehender who sees the context, by exactly the predictive information memory loses
(`averageDifficulty_bayes_sub_lossless`); the data processing inequality makes the loss
nonnegative.

Information locality (section 5) is proved in the single-dependency configuration, where the
paper's first-order approximation is exact: under erasure noise (`erasure`), which keeps the
context word with probability `1 - e`, difficulty is the unigram surprisal less the surviving
fraction of the pointwise mutual information, so with progressive noise, a more distant word
erased more often, difficulty grows with distance when the words are positively associated and
shrinks when they are negatively associated (`locality`, `antilocality`). No erasure is the
lossless case and certain erasure recovers the unigram prior.

## Implementation notes

* Pointwise mutual information is taken relative to the unigram distribution of the next word,
  the language model averaged over the context prior, and the erasure process reads an erased
  word as that prior.
* Structural forgetting (section 4) is a parameter-space simulation over toy grammars, with
  forgetting at low verb-final relative-clause rates as for English and none at the German
  rate; it stays in prose.
