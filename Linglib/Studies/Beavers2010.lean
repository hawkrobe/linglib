# Beavers (2010): The Structure of Lexical Meaning

This file formalizes Beavers's account of object/oblique alternations. The direct realization of an
alternating argument carries monotonically stronger lexical entailments than its oblique
realization, rather than a different event structure. In the conative and locative alternations
the entailments are the degrees of affectedness, each an existential weakening of the next, so that
of the eight sets of the three affectedness entailments only four are contentful, and they form a
chain. The Morphosyntactic Alignment Principle requires the oblique to bear the minimally weaker
role, which on the chain is weak covering. Every attested contrast satisfies it, the three
conatives together realize each covering pair, and reversed and level-skipping alternations violate
it. Total traversal of a path is the same entailment as quantized change, read of the scale rather
than the theme, and adding it to the entailments of patienthood gives five contentful roles, among
which *climb the stairs* and *climb up the stairs* are a minimal contrast. The same principle runs
on the chain of arrival and possession behind the dative alternation.

## Implementation notes

* A role is a set of entailments. The contentful sets of affectedness entailments are the lower
  sets, which correspond to the degrees by Birkhoff's representation, so a contrast records the
  degrees of the alternating participant in its two realizations.
* The entailments are stated over a result relation relative to a world. Potential for change is
  modal ((38)), and it is an existential generalization of nonquantized change only when the actual
  world is among the worlds the modality ranges over, which the paper assumes and the file takes as
  a hypothesis. Beavers leaves the modal base open.
* The paper defines the degrees of traversal (85) by the formulas of the degrees of affectedness,
  abstracting over the scale instead of the theme, so the file states each formula once. Only total
  traversal enters the roles of (86), and naming a role of (87) by its strongest entailment rules
  out affected paths, as the paper assumes.
* The paper states its conditions of a sentence with the theme, scale and event given; the file
  states them of a relation, over all themes, scales and events. A predicate-supplied goal is fixed
  across the predicate's events, so the end of the path in (84a) is read as the endpoint of the
  goal type.
* Beavers's rough correspondence between Dowty's proto-patient entailments and his own (Table 5)
  is not formalized, since it marks two of its cells as uncertain.

## TODO

* Derive the contrasts from the example rows of `Data.Examples.Beavers2010` rather than typing the
  verbs and degrees in.

/-! ### L-thematic roles as sets of entailments ((65)–(67))

An L-thematic role is a set of lexical entailments. The three affectedness entailments of (65)
entail one another, so a set of them is contentful exactly when it is closed under entailment, and
the contentful sets are the degrees of affectedness (`AffectednessDegree.entailments`). -/

example : Fintype.card (Set AffectednessEntailment) = 8 := by rw [Fintype.card_set]; rfl

/-! ### The entailments ((31), (38))

The result relation `R w x s g e` says that in the world `w` the theme `x` ends the event `e` at
the goal `g` on the scale `s`, and `w₀` is the actual world. -/
