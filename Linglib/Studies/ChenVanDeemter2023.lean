# Chen and van Deemter (2023): Varieties of Specification

This file formalizes the set-theoretic account of over- and under-specification in
[chen-van-deemter-2023]. A description is a bag of attribute–value pairs over the knowledge
base of [dale-reiter-1995], and it is distinguishing when it holds of the referent and of no
distractor. An over-specification is a distinguishing description that is not minimal, and it
is real, numerical, nominal or duplicate-attribute according to which of its occurrences are
superfluous; an under-specification, whose extension in the setting properly contains the
referent, is mixed when some occurrence can be dropped without changing the extension and pure
otherwise; a wrong description has a property false of the referent. The paper's four theorems
hold for any knowledge base and nonempty set of distractors, and the worked examples of its
running scene are classified.

## Implementation notes

* Descriptions are multisets so that a property can occur twice. On a `Finset` description
  `Distinguishing` is Dale and Reiter's (`distinguishing_val_iff`).
* A superfluous occurrence is one of a distinguishing description, as the paper defines it. The
  remark under its nominal over-specification that distinguishing need not be required
  separately holds only for properties true of the referent, so the definitions here carry it.
* Minimality counts property occurrences, as `MinimalFor` on the multiset's cardinality among
  distinguishing descriptions.
* The theorem that a duplicate-attribute over-specification is real or nominal uses that a
  knowledge base assigns one value per attribute, so a distinguishing description has one type.
* The scenes carry the objects and colours of the paper's two figures. Sizes and orientations,
  which the figures do not label, are as the text's classifications require: only the target of
  the first scene is large, and in the second every small object is green and the target and one
  other desk face front.
