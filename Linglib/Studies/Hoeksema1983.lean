# Hoeksema (1983): negative polarity and the comparative

This file formalizes Hoeksema's semantics for the two comparative constructions of English and
Dutch. The NP-comparative *taller than NP* sends a generalized quantifier `Q` to the individuals
`x` for which the set of individuals shorter than `x` belongs to `Q`. This map is a Boolean
homomorphism and the only one that gets the comparative right on proper names, so it is
monotone increasing and, by Ladusaw's criterion, no environment for negative polarity items.
The S-comparative *taller than S* sends a set of degrees to the individuals above all of them.
It is anti-additive and hence monotone decreasing, so it licenses negative polarity items,
including the Dutch *ook maar*, which Zwarts's hypothesis restricts to anti-additive triggers.
The two comparatives coincide on a proper name and the singleton of its degree.

## Main definitions

* `npComparative`: the NP-comparative as a complete lattice homomorphism (Definition 3).
* `PreservesOrdering`: a map from quantifiers to predicates respects the grading relation on
  proper names (Definition 4).

## Main results

* `PreservesOrdering.eq`: two homomorphisms that preserve the ordering are equal (Fact 2).
* `PreservesOrdering.eq_npComparative`: the NP-comparative is the only one (§3.5).
* `not_antitone_npComparative`: the NP-comparative is not monotone decreasing (§3.6).
* `gtOverSet_antitone`: the S-comparative is monotone decreasing (§3.8).
* `npComparative_individual`: the two comparatives agree on proper names (§3.9).
* `not_isAntiAdditive_notEveryDutchman`: *niet iedere Nederlander* is not anti-additive (§4.1).

## Implementation notes

Degrees are values of a measure `μ` in a preorder rather than the equivalence classes of
Definition 7, and the grading relation `x > y` is `μ y < μ x`. The results on the
NP-comparative need neither of the paper's conditions on grading relations (Definitions 1
and 2). The homomorphism preserves arbitrary unions and intersections, which Fact 2 needs on
infinite domains (the paper's footnote 11). The S-comparative of Definition 8 is
`(μ ⁻¹' strictUpperBounds ·)`, and its anti-additivity (Fact 5) is
`Degree.gtOverSet_isAntiAdditive`.

/-! ### The NP-comparative -/

/-- The NP-comparative of Definition 3 holds of `x` and a quantifier `Q` when the individuals
below `x` on the scale `μ` form a set in `Q`. As a preimage map it preserves intersections,
unions and complements, which is (22). -/
