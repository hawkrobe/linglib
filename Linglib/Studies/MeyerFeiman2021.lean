# Meyer and Feiman (2021): Priming Reveals Similarities and Differences Between Implicatures

This file formalizes the implicature spectrum that [meyer-feiman-2021] propose to reconcile
their structural-priming results. The core implicature mechanism has two sub-computations,
generating alternatives and negating them, and each may run online or have its output
stored; alternatives generated online cannot have been pre-negated, so the spectrum has
three points (`Spectrum`, `spectrum_iff`): both steps online, the alternatives stored and
negated online, or the enriched reading stored as a second lexical entry. Two readings
prime each other when they share an online sub-computation that can be primed (`Primes`).
Three experiments find that *some* and number words prime each other while free-choice
disjunction primes neither; the paper places *some* at the fully online point and number
words at the stored-alternatives point, so the shared computation behind the effect is the
negation of alternatives (`negate_primeable`), and the free-choice data then rule out the
recursive-implicature derivation of free choice, which negates alternatives, while
admitting the alternative-asserting mechanism of [bar-lev-fox-2017] exactly when generation
cannot be primed and modal-specific accounts such as [simons-2005] unconditionally
(`fits_iff`).

## Implementation notes

A derivation is represented by the finite set of sub-computations it runs online; the
paper's hypothesis for *some* and number words with free choice left open is `spectrum`,
and `Fits` compares an account's predicted between-category priming with the observed
pattern. Within-category priming, the higher enrichment rate for number words, and the
experiments' picture-similarity controls are not represented.
