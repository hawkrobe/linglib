# Majid, Boster and Bowerman (2008): The Cross-Linguistic Categorization of Everyday Events

This file formalizes the stimulus clips of [majid-boster-bowerman-2008] and the English
descriptions they report. Speakers of twenty-eight languages described sixty-one clips of
separation events, and a correspondence analysis of which clips shared a verb found four
dimensions across the forty-three agentive cutting-and-breaking clips: the predictability of
the locus of separation, tearing, snapping against smashing, and poking a hole. A clip is
described by what the paper states about it, as a region of the substrate's `Root.Content`.

## Main definitions

* `stimulus`: the instrument, object dimensionality and result the paper states for a clip
* `tearing`, `pullingYarn`, `snapping`, `smashing`: the clips named for Dimensions 2 and 3

## Main results

* `dim1_not_factorsThrough`: the first dimension is a function neither of the instrument nor
  of the object
* `tear_overlaps_stimulus`, `not_cut_not_break_of_tearing`, `break_overlaps_stimulus`: the
  English fragment's *tear*, *cut* and *break* agree with the descriptions the paper reports

## Implementation notes

Clips are the appendix numbers. A dimension the paper leaves unstated is unconstrained, so a
root is compatible with a clip (`Root.Content.Overlaps`) when its regions contain the stated
values. The paper classes rope as one-dimensional but not yarn, which is coded like rope.
Positions on the first dimension enter only through the order the text states.

## TODO

The per-language naming data are not in the paper. Its illustrations need fragments with
separation roots: the placement of the karate chop by Chontal, Hindi and Jalonke, and the
Yélî Dnye tearing verb's extension to carrots split along the grain (§3.1). The English
fragment lacks the change-of-state *snap* (its *snap* is the manner-of-speaking verb) and the
*smash*, *stab* and *bodge* the paper reports.

/-! ### Clips -/

/-- In the tearing clips cloth is torn by hand, completely (clip 1) or halfway (clip 36).
Dimension 2 sets them apart from all other clips (§3.1). -/
def tearing : Finset ℕ := {1, 36}

/-- In clips 35 and 38 yarn is pulled apart, and English, German and Dutch extend their
tearing verb to them (§3.1). -/
def pullingYarn : Finset ℕ := {35, 38}

/-- In the snapping clips (25, 19, 57, 5) pressure on both ends separates a one-dimensional
rigid object into two pieces. They form one pole of Dimension 3 (§3.1). -/
def snapping : Finset ℕ := {25, 19, 57, 5}

/-- In the smashing clips (40, 39, 21, 31) a blow fragments a rigid object into many pieces.
They form the other pole of Dimension 3 (§3.1). -/
def smashing : Finset ℕ := {40, 39, 21, 31}

/-- `stimulus c` is what the paper states about clip `c`, as a region of root content. The
hands tear cloth, pull yarn apart and snap one-dimensional objects, a hammer fragments the
smashed objects, and clips 10 and 32 cut a carrot, one of the paper's one-dimensional objects
(§2.2), with a knife and with a karate chop. -/
def stimulus (c : ℕ) : Content :=
  if c ∈ tearing then
    { instrument := {.hands}, resultGeometry := {.separation}, patientDimensionality := {.twoD} }
  else if c ∈ pullingYarn then
    { instrument := {.hands}, resultGeometry := {.separation}, patientDimensionality := {.oneD} }
  else if c ∈ snapping then
    { instrument := {.hands}, resultGeometry := {.fracture}, patientDimensionality := {.oneD} }
  else if c ∈ smashing then
    { instrument := {.bluntImpact}, resultGeometry := {.fragmentation} }
  else if c = 10 then { instrument := {.sharpBlade}, patientDimensionality := {.oneD} }
  else if c = 32 then { instrument := {.hands}, patientDimensionality := {.oneD} }
  else {}

/-! ### The first dimension -/

/-- Placement on Dimension 1, the predictability of the locus of separation, is a function
neither of the instrument nor of the object (§3.1). The hands alone karate-chop a carrot in the
middle of the dimension (clip 32) and snap a twig at its unpredictable end (clip 19); carrots
are sliced at the predictable end (clip 10) and karate-chopped in the middle. -/
theorem dim1_not_factorsThrough {P : Type*} [Preorder P] (pos : ℕ → P)
    (h₁ : pos 10 < pos 32) (h₂ : pos 32 < pos 19) :
    ¬ pos.FactorsThrough (fun c ↦ (stimulus c).instrument) ∧
      ¬ pos.FactorsThrough (fun c ↦ (stimulus c).patientDimensionality) :=
  ⟨fun h ↦ h₂.ne (h (by decide)), fun h ↦ h₁.ne (h (by decide))⟩

/-! ### English -/

/-- English speakers labeled the tearing clips *tear* and extended the verb to pulling yarn
apart (§3.1, Dimension 2); the fragment's *tear* is compatible with all four clips. -/
theorem tear_overlaps_stimulus :
    ∀ c ∈ tearing ∪ pullingYarn, tear_.rootContent.Overlaps (stimulus c) := by
  decide

/-- English speakers labeled the tearing clips *tear* as distinct from *cut* and *break*
(§3.1), and the fragment's *cut* and *break*, which want a blade and a fractured or fragmented
result, reject them. -/
theorem not_cut_not_break_of_tearing : ∀ c ∈ tearing,
    ¬ cut.rootContent.Overlaps (stimulus c) ∧ ¬ break_.rootContent.Overlaps (stimulus c) := by
  decide

/-- Some English speakers grouped the snapping and smashing clips together under *break*
(§3.1, Dimension 3), the general verb beside the specific *snap* and *smash* to which the paper
attributes the intermediate correlation of English with that dimension (§3.1.1). -/
theorem break_overlaps_stimulus :
    ∀ c ∈ snapping ∪ smashing, break_.rootContent.Overlaps (stimulus c) := by
  decide
