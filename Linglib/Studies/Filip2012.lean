# Filip (2012): Lexical aspect

This file formalizes the mereological core of [filip-2012]'s survey of lexical aspect. The
telic/atelic distinction is diagnosed by temporal adverbials — *in an hour* with telic and
*for an hour* with atelic predicates (1) — and, following [krifka-1998], telic predicates are
taken as quantized (23) and atelic ones as cumulative (24), the substrate's `QUA` and `CUM`.
Aspectual composition (25)–(27) is [krifka-1989]'s: the predicate an incremental verb forms
with its object is quantized or cumulative as the object is, the substrate's
`qua_propagation` and `cum_propagation` for `IsSincVerb`, while a verb without the
incremental mapping, like *watch*, is atelic whatever its object (26). Hence the three
classes of (28): telic verbs, whose eventualities have no proper parts in the relation
(`Quantized`, `telic_of_quantized`); atelic verbs, whose relation persists to the parts of an
eventuality, the subinterval property (19) (`Persistent`, `not_telic_of_persistent`); and
incremental verbs, lexically unmarked for telicity because their non-degeneracy provides both
a quantized and a cumulative object (`incremental_underspecified`). Incrementality and
telicity are independent (29): a quantized verb is not strictly incremental
(`not_sinc_of_quantized`), and an incremental verb with a cumulative object is atelic. The
diagnostic data (1), (25), (26), (31), (37) are rows of `Data/Examples/Filip2012.json`, and
`rows_test` checks the adverbial judgments against the telicity the classification assigns.

## Implementation notes

* Telicity is identified with quantization "for the purposes of this summary" (§7), so the
  telic/atelic contrast is the substrate's `QUA`/`CUM` and the atelic verbs' persistence is
  stated with `≤` on eventualities.
* The verb classes of the rows are the chapter's: *recover* and *reach* telic, *swim* and
  *watch* atelic, *eat* and *prove* incremental; `Row.Telic` states the classification's
  verdict, whose semantic content is the theorems above.
* The chapter's surveys of Vendler's and Dowty's classifications (§§3–6) and of degree-based
  approaches (§8) summarize other authors' analyses and are not formalized here.
