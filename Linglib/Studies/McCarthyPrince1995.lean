# McCarthy and Prince (1995): Faithfulness and Reduplicative Identity

This file formalizes three analyses from McCarthy and Prince's correspondence theory of
reduplication. In the basic model a reduplicated form has an input stem, a base and a
reduplicant, with faithfulness between input and base and identity between base and
reduplicant, and a phonological constraint interacts with both. Javanese deletes
intervocalic *h*, and in a suffixed reduplication the *h* is lost from both copies although
only one is intervocalic, which is overapplication (§3.4). Balangao copies the first two
syllables of the base without the final coda although the language allows codas, which is
emergence of the unmarked (§4.2). Akan palatalizes a velar before a front vowel, but not in
the reduplicant of *kɪ–ka*, which is underapplication (§5.1).

A candidate here is a correspondence between the input stem, the base and the reduplicant,
and every constraint is computed from it: MAX and IDENT from the correspondence, and the
phonological constraints from the surface string. The rankings are not fixed in advance.
Each result says which rankings of the paper's constraints select which candidate.

## Main definitions

* `Javanese.Candidate`, `Balangao.Candidate`, `Akan.Candidate`: the candidates of tableaux
  (39), (106) and (131), each with its `correspondence` and `surface`.
* `Javanese.con`, `Balangao.con`, `Akan.con`: the constraints of those tableaux.

## Main results

* `Javanese.optimal_eq`: each candidate of (39) violates one constraint, and the winner is the
  candidate whose constraint is ranked last.
* `Javanese.overapplication`, `Javanese.normalApplication`,
  `Javanese.underapplication_notMem`: with *VhV above MAX-IO, MAX-BR above MAX-IO gives
  overapplication and the reverse gives normal application, and the underapplying candidate
  wins under no such ranking.
* `Balangao.optimal_iff`: the coda-sparing reduplicant wins exactly under MAX-IO ≫ NO-CODA ≫
  MAX-BR.
* `Akan.optimal_iff`: with PAL above IDENT-IO(−cor), the unpalatalized *kɪ–ka* wins exactly
  when OCP(+cor) and IDENT-BR(−cor) both dominate PAL.

## Implementation notes

Javanese is analysed with suffixing reduplication, the paper's tableau (39). Its prefixing
alternative (38), where DEP-BR does the work of MAX-BR, is not formalized. A coda is counted
as a consonant that no vowel follows, which suffices for the CV(C) syllables of the Balangao
forms. The paper measures OCP(+cor) by featural duplication in dissimilar constituents and
prints three marks for the overapplying candidate of (131) without spelling the count out.
Here the constraint is violated once by a syllable with a palatal onset and a front vowel
before a syllable with a coronal onset and a vowel that is not front, which agrees with the
paper's verdicts on *kita*, *tɕita*, *dʑidʑe* and the three candidates. The Akan segments are
those of the Akan fragment.
