# Roberts (2023): Imperatives in dynamic pragmatics

This file formalizes the paper's semantics and dynamic pragmatics for imperative mood. An
imperative denotes a property indexed to the addressee, its realization conditions. Over
circumstances, world–time pairs, a goal-based ordering source gives an agent's goals at a
circumstance in priority order, the timely futures of a circumstance are its possible futures at
which those goals remain in force, `timelyFut`, and a futurate circumstantial modal base delivers
the actual future circumstances in which realizing the prejacent is feasible, `IsFuturate`. The
paper's first-pass preference over circumstances ranks them by the highest-priority goal and
breaks ties by the next, which is the lexicographic order on goal profiles, `profile`; it
refines Kratzer's ordering, `profile_le_of_atLeastAsGoodAs`. The applicable circumstances are
those in whose timely futures realizing the prejacent is never worse, by the goals held there,
than not realizing it, `applic`, and the property holds of an addressee who in every applicable
circumstance comes to realize the prejacent in time, `realizes`. The content is conditional and
futurate but not deontic: an if-clause restricts the modal base, `realizes_restrict`, and
deontic force arises only when a direction is accepted and the realization of the property joins
the addressee's goals on the scoreboard, after which, other goals being equal, circumstances
realizing it are preferred, `Scoreboard.accept_prefers`. The illocutionary force linking
principle sends each type of denotation to the scoreboard coordinate it updates,
`Denotation.defaultForce`, and the conservativity presupposition on imperative subjects restricts
quantificational subjects to the addressees, `nobody_livesOn`, so that *Nobody move!* directs
each addressee not to move, `realizes_nobody_move`.

## Implementation notes

A goal-based ordering source is a Kratzer `OrderingSource` over circumstances, and possible
futures are the substrate's `futureHistoryBase`; a goal held at a circumstance remains in force
at a later one when it is among the goals held there. The goal profile of a circumstance is the
list of its goals' truth values in priority order, so goal-relative preference is `<` on
`List Prop`, the lexicographic order with `False < True`, and "at least as good" in the
applicability condition is its negation `≤`, which agrees with the paper's `≥` because the
order is total. The property an accepted direction adds to the goals is the imperative's
denotation, its realization conditions, and the paper leaves where it enters the hierarchy
open; here it is appended below the goals already held. The common ground is the library's
filter with the Stalnakerian assertion of `Discourse/CommonGround.lean`, so the scoreboard is a
`HasAssertion` instance. The addressee-part relation is flattened to membership in the set of
addressees, and the restriction of the property to addressees, which the paper writes as a
domain restriction on the abstracted individual, is left to the conservativity presupposition
rather than built into the domain of `realizes`.

## TODO

* Formulas (51c) and (53) reuse the world variable of the circumstance being rated for the
  realizing witness while quantifying that witness over the timely futures, which range over
  possible worlds; the possible-futures reading is formalized, and the gloss "it's possible
  ... for a to come to realize P" supports it.
* The retirement clauses of (58) and (59), a question dropped once answered and a goal dropped
  once realized or unrealizable, the comparison with the rival accounts of §5, the desiderata
  of §1, the plural-addressee derivation of *Everyone gather!*, embedded imperatives and free
  choice disjunction are discussed in the paper without a proposal formalized here.
