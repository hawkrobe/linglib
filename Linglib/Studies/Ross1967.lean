# Ross (1967): Constraints on Variables in Syntax

This file formalizes the dissertation's constraints on the variables of reordering
transformations, stated over the positions a moved constituent leaves behind in a
constituent-structure tree: the Complex NP Constraint, that nothing is moved out of a sentence
dominated by a noun phrase with a lexical head noun (`CNPC`); the Coordinate Structure
Constraint, that no conjunct is moved and nothing is moved out of a conjunct (`CSC`); the Left
Branch Condition, that no noun phrase on the left branch of a larger noun phrase is moved out
of it (`LBC`); and the Sentential Subject Constraint, that nothing is moved out of a sentence
in subject position (`SSC`). A movement is a source position and a landing position in a tree,
and a constraint is violated when the positions the movement crosses, the ancestors of the
source that do not dominate the landing site, contain the configuration the constraint names.
The dissertation's examples are rows whose trees and movements are built here, and
`chopping_rows` reads their judgments as the constraints predict, the acceptable ones being
exactly those that violate none; `copying_rows` is the dissertation's other generalization,
that a copying rule such as Left Dislocation, which leaves a pronoun behind, crosses every one
of these islands freely.

## Implementation notes

Trees carry the categories of `Syntax.Cat`, which have no levels: a noun phrase is a node of
category `N`, a coordinate structure a node of category `Conj` headed by its conjunction word, whose
other daughters are the conjuncts, and a noun phrase has a lexical head noun when its head daughter
is a noun. The trees are the dissertation's diagrams reduced to the categories the constraints
mention, with the moved constituent in its source position; questions and topicalizations land at
the root and relativizations at the relative clause. Dominance in the Sentential Subject Constraint
is read as immediate, the configuration of a sentence exhaustively dominated by a subject NP, so
that the constraint does not reach a clause inside a relative clause on a subject. The A-over-A
principle, the pied-piping convention, upward boundedness, and the definition of islands as the
domains of chopping rules are not formalized.
