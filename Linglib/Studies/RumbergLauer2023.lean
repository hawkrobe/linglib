# Rumberg and Lauer (2023): What if, and when? Conditionals, tense, and branching time

An isolated present tense sentence can talk about the future only when the eventuality is
settled: the game the Red Sox play tomorrow is scheduled, their winning it is not. In the
antecedent of an indicative conditional the constraint disappears, the consequent can be read
at a later moment than the utterance ([crouch-1993]'s *if I smile when I get out, the
interview went well*), and a past tense antecedent never shifts this way. The paper
reconstructs the accounts of [kaufmann-2005-truth] and [schulz-2008] in branching time and
measures them, and its own proposal, against these facts.

Both rivals instantiate Kratzer's recipe, the conditional as a universal quantifier over a
domain of antecedent possibilities, which this file renders with the library's conditional
operators. Kaufmann's conditional is the strict conditional over the forward extension of
historical accessibility, with the antecedent settled (`kaufmannCond`); Schulz's is the
ordering conditional over the later moments, preferring the earliest by time (`schulzCond`).
Both can place the antecedent at a future moment, so both wrongly shift past tense
antecedents. The paper's own account uses the transition semantics of [rumberg-2016]: truth
is relative to a moment and a course of events, the future operator quantifies only over the
histories the course admits (`Transition.future`), and the conditional reads its consequent
at the first moment of decidedness of each minimal course making the antecedent true
(`Transition.cond`). At the actual past the future operator is settledness; a present
antecedent can be true relative to a longer course without being settled; and a past
antecedent's only minimal course is the actual past, so its consequent never shifts.

## Main statements

* `Transition.future_atom_self`, `Transition.present_atom_self`: at the actual past, future
  truth is settledness, so the isolated futurate present requires it.
* `Transition.future_atom_of_lt`: relative to a course leading to a witness, a future claim
  is true without being settled, which frees the antecedent.
* `Transition.cond_past_atom`: a past antecedent's consequent is read at the utterance
  moment, so past antecedents never shift.
* `Transition.cond_eq_orderingImp`: the paper's conditional is Kratzer's recipe over the
  extensions of the actual past, except that the consequent is read at the first moment of
  decidedness.
* `Transition.future_atom_subset_stable`: future truth persists under extensions of the
  course, the stability behind the covert necessity operator.
* `Game.settledness_contrast`, `Game.antecedent_true_without_settledness`: the Red Sox
  minimal pair.
* `Trains.schulz_validates_arrival_at_two`, `Trains.kaufmann_rejects_both_arrivals`,
  `Trains.transition_rejects_both_arrivals`: on the two-trains scenario Schulz's minimality
  wrongly validates the early arrival, while Kaufmann with a permissive context and the
  transition account reject both.
* `Interview.smile_conditional_shifts_consequent`: Crouch's shifted reading, with the
  consequent read after the interview.
* `Interview.rivals_shift_past_antecedents`, `Interview.no_shifted_antecedent_moment`: the
  rivals shift a past tense antecedent where the transition account cannot.

## Implementation notes

The paper's transition sets with a last transition are represented by their first moment of
decidedness, as licensed by its Definition 18, where extending a course is moving up the
order and the actual past at a moment is the moment itself; the identification of course
extension with the order relies on the existence of branching points, the connectedness the
paper imposes for this purpose. Kaufmann's contextual parameter is carried as a set of
moments, following the paper's note that it is in effect a property of times. The clock time
of a moment in the finite scenarios is its depth in the tree of Gorn addresses. Claims on the
finite models are decided through the reduction of histories to maximal moments.

Truth is relative to a moment and a course of events, represented by the moment whose past
the course is: the actual past at `m` is the pair `(m, m)`, and extending the course is
moving up the order. The future operator quantifies over the histories through the moment
that the course admits. -/
