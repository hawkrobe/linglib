# Embick (2021): The Motivation for Roots in Distributed Morphology

This file formalizes [embick-2021]'s case for category-free roots. The Two Domains Intuition (1),
that some form–meaning connections are fixed close to a lexical primitive and others are built
compositionally, is explained not by the word, as lexicalism (5) has it, but by syntactic locality
around roots. Following [marantz-1997]'s update of [chomsky-1970], derived nominals combine the
root directly with n and gerunds nominalize a verbal structure, (8) and (9); agents are licensed
only by a Voice that selects v, the Agent-Licensing Assumption (10), so *growth* has no agentive
reading while *growing* does, and *destruction* gets one only from its encyclopedically agentive
root, (6) and (7). In the Roots-and-contexts theory of §5 the category-defining heads are cyclic:
a head attached to the categorized root may show root-determined allomorphy and a special
interpretation while an outer cyclic head may not, the generalizations (13) of
[embick-marantz-2008] and structure (14), whereas an outer noncyclic head, the tense of *ben-t* or
the aspect of *brok-en*, is still local to the root, structure (15). Since *growth* and *growing*
are both words, the word cannot be the domain; the domains are the cycles.

## Implementation notes

* Cycles and the root's domain are the substrate's `Spine` API, the cyclic domains of
  [embick-2010] that the paper adopts for (14) and (15); this file contributes the heads of the
  examples, the Agent-Licensing Assumption, the rows and the predictions checked over them.
* The gerund's verbal structure is taken as v with the agent-licensing Voice above it, the second
  option of (10).
* The examples are `Data.Examples.Embick2021`.
