# Waldon et al. (2023): On the Context Dependence of Artifact Noun Interpretation

Waldon, Condoravdi, Levin and Degen ask how a policy goal shapes the boundary of an artifact
noun category, as in *no electronic devices are allowed in the theater* read with the goal of
limiting light or of limiting noise. Following Sassoon and Fadlon, an artifact noun denotes an
additive, weighted measure over several dimensions. The paper makes the weights contextual: an
explicit goal weights the category measure by `γ` and the goal-relevant feature by `1 − γ`, and
with no goal stated the goal weight is split by the goals' plausibility. With a uniform
threshold and an even prior, the posterior that an object is prohibited is the measure itself.
The Goal Insensitive hypothesis is `γ = 1`; the experiment's Bayesian analysis estimates `γ` at
about 0.76, with 1 outside the credible interval.

## Main statements

* `prohibitionPosterior_eq`: the posterior that an object is prohibited is its measure.
* `not_threshold_shift`: one goal raising an object and lowering another is not a shift of the
  standard of comparison.

## Implementation notes

Objects and goals are types, and the category, feature and plausibility measures of the
norming studies are the fields of `Norming`, bounded as the slider scales are, in place of
values retyped from the paper; every prediction is stated over them and over `γ`. The
posterior is the Bayes ratio with the threshold marginalized by Lebesgue measure on `[0, m]`.
The paper's examples are the rows of `Data.Examples.WaldonEtAl2023`.
