# Bruening and Al Khalaf 2020: category mismatches in coordination

Bruening and Al Khalaf argue that coordinated arguments must match in category and may violate
selection in two configurations only, a clause beside a noun phrase where only noun phrases are
selected and a non-*ly* adverb beside an adjective before a noun. The violating conjunct is never
the one next to the selector, and the two violations are those ellipsis and displacement permit.
They derive the clausal case from a null N that makes a noun phrase of a clause but bears none of
the semantic selectional features (S-features) a selector checks, with c-selection checked against
every conjunct and S-features checked once, as soon as possible, in a structure built from left to
right. A coordinate phrase stacks its conjuncts' features by recency, so a selector that precedes it
checks the first conjunct and one that follows it the last, `HeadDirection.nearest`, where the
accounts that make the first conjunct prominent check `List.take 1`. The adverbial case rests on a
silent Adv head that ellipsis or a partial copy can leave out. The paper's examples are the rows of
`Data/Examples/BrueningAlKhalaf2020`.

## Main definitions

* `Conjunct`: a phrase as it enters a coordination, itself or a clause under the null N.
* `Licensed`, `Satisfies`, `Admits`: the conditions on coordinated arguments and predicates.
* `checkedOnce`: the conjunct a selector checks its S-features against, once.
* `NominalCoordination`, `Displaced`: an adverb's two escapes from the ban on modifying a noun.

## Main results

* `mem_cats_of_mem_nearest`: the phrase next to the selector is selected in its own category.
* `mem_cats_or_of_admits`: the only violation is a clause where a noun phrase is selected.
* `exists_admits_iff_admits_elided`: a phrase may violate selection in a coordination exactly when
  ellipsis of the selector may strand it.
* `mem_cats_of_admits_id`: speakers whose S-features persist admit no violation in coordination.
* `nominalCoordination_iff`, `displaced_iff`: a non-*ly* adverb may modify a noun when coordinated
  before an adjective or displaced.
* `argument_rows` and its siblings: the model's verdict on each example is its judgment.

## Implementation notes

* Coordinated predicates bear the supercategory Pred of Sag, Gazdar, Wasow and Weisler, which is
  all coordination compares, so they need only `Satisfies`. The coordinator is left implicit.
* Argument–modifier coordination (§2.1) and the displacement of clauses (§§4.1, 4.5) are not
  formalized. The questionable (69) counts as excluded.
