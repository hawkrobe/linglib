# Asher & Pelletier 2013: generics as modal quantifiers

A characterizing generic *φs ψ* is ∀x(φ(x) > ψ(x)), with > the weak conditional of commonsense
entailment: for each individual, ψ holds throughout the worlds where that individual is a
normal φ, the conditional of a normality on worlds (`Genericity.Normality.gen`). Normality is
selected per restrictor, so *Birds fly* and *Penguins don't fly* hold together, the normal
Opus-penguin worlds not being normal Opus-bird worlds, which a fixed set of normal worlds cannot
provide; and it has give:
the teleological and the statistical construal disagree on whether turtles live to be a
hundred. Against the probabilistic rival, on which a generic is true when the scope is more
likely than not given the restrictor, the paper objects that a margin just over half verifies
generics that are not true, and that embedded generics trivialize the account: under
conditionalization the probability of the conditional collapses to that of the scope. Logical
forms are then built by putting the focused material in the nuclear scope and its
alternatives in the restrictor, which weakens the restrictor where needed (ducks lay eggs),
lets a tautologous restrictor deliver an existential (firemen are available), and, with a
further generic over circumstances, gives mosquitoes their disposition to carry the virus.

Item numbers follow the 2012 preprint.

## Main definitions

* `generic`: the generic quantifier over a normality on worlds, whose conditional is the weak
  conditional.
* `generic_disjoint`, `generic_inter`: contrary generics select disjoint worlds; the scope
  weakens.
* `normal_ofAccess_eq_empty`, `exists_bird_penguin`: a fixed set of normal worlds leaves no normal
  penguin world once birds fly and penguins don't, while a normality from an ordering of worlds
  has one.
* `existentialReading`, `gen_univ`, `doubleGeneric`: the alternatives-based, the tautologous,
  and the circumstantial restrictor.
* `Conditionalizes`, `cond_eq_of_conditionalizes`: the trivialization of probabilistic
  generics.
