# Enguehard (2024): What number marking on indefinites means: conceivability presuppositions and sensitivity to probabilities

Singular and plural indefinites infer exactly one witness and at least two, (1), but under
negation both mean that there is none, (2)–(3). Following Spector and Zweig these inferences are
scalar enrichments of a weak existential meaning, the exhaustifications of `TieuEtAl2020`, and
the cardinalities a number fits are those English gives a referent of that many individuals.
Enguehard shows that what survives negation is a conceivability presupposition (7): each number
presupposes that a witness set it fits is conceivable, so a book has no *table of contents* and
no *chapters*, (5)–(6).

In a production experiment the share of plural among negated indefinites rises gradiently with
the probability that symbols come in multiples, and both numbers are produced at parity,
(10)–(11). Productions form a kernel from conditions, and the categorical rule that Maximize
Presupposition derives from Farkas and de Swart's prototypicality generalization (8) is a
zero-one law, which the experiment refutes (§4.1). Enguehard's account has speakers prefer
referents that later continuations can resume: a negated indefinite sets one up, as in the
bilateral dynamic semantics of Krahmer and Muskens and of Elliott, and a pronoun resuming it bears
its number, as Sudo assumes, and must fit the witness set, (14)–(23). The preference yields the
conceivability presupposition, which fails exactly where the chance of ineffability is certain
(§6).

## Main statements

* `useful_iff_presup`: preferring useful referents yields the conceivability presupposition.
* `negated_presup_iff_ineffability_ne_one`: the presupposition holds exactly when ineffability is
  not certain.
* `Follows.H1_of_mpPresup`, `not_H2_of_isZeroOneMeasure`: Maximize Presupposition yields the
  categorical H1, and a speaker in complementary distribution is not gradient.
* `not_H2_of_follows_bestGuess`: a speaker producing only best guesses is not gradient either.

## Implementation notes

* Worlds are witness cardinalities, as in `TieuEtAl2020`, and the conceivable cardinalities are a
  parameter, so the presupposition is constant across worlds.
* A production is a negated indefinite of some number or another strategy (`none`), the three
  categories of Figure 2, and the hypotheses concern the productions conditioned on the
  indefinites, the second analysis of footnote 8. Figure 2 is a plot, so no share is typed.
* The limiting case takes the conceivable cardinalities to be those of positive probability, and
  a condition enters as the probability of multiples given a witness.
* The negated indefinites of (2) and the negative ones of (3) are both `Polarity.negative`.

## TODO

* Exact minimization makes the best guess a majority rule (`bestGuess_plural_iff`), so a speaker
  producing only best guesses is categorical off parity, while Figure 2 shows both numbers in
  every intermediate condition. The gradience needs a probabilistic choice rule over
  `ineffability`, or variation in the distribution each participant saw (footnote 5), which the
  paper leaves open.
* Projection out of questions (§2) awaits a question semantics over `PartialProp`.
