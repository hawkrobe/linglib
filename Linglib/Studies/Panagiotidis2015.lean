# Panagiotidis (2015): Categorial Features

This file formalizes the theory of word class in [panagiotidis-2015]: lexical category is
not a property of roots but of the categorizer heads *n*, *v*, and *a* that category-neutral
roots merge with ([marantz-1997]), and the categorial features those heads bear are
substantive and interpretable rather than diacritic, [N] imposing a sortal perspective and
[V] a perspective extending into time on the root's concept. Nouns bear [N] only, verbs [V]
only, adjectives both, and adpositions neither, the adposition being the default categorizer
(`categorizer_features`, `isCategorizer_iff`). The functional heads of an extended projection
carry uninterpretable copies of their categorizer's features, so a category's features are
fixed by its family (`categorialFeatures_eq_iff`), and the diacritic features of
[chomsky-1970] cut the categories into the same four classes (`chomsky_panagiotidis_agree`).
Category change is change of categorizer: an English root surfaces in all three categorized
classes (`RootFamily`, `all_families_tricategorial`).

## Implementation notes

The features of a category are read off its extended-projection family, since the book has
every functional head carry a copy of its categorizer's features; the substrate's `Cat.features`
reads Chomsky's features off the family the same way, so the two systems are compared as
images of the family. The book's distinction between a categorizer's interpretable features and
the copies on functional heads is not represented. The root families are the standard English
illustrations of category-neutral roots from the Distributed Morphology literature rather than
data from the book.
