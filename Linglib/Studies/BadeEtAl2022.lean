# Bade, Picat, Chung and Mascarenhas (2022): Alternatives and attention in language and reasoning

This file formalizes the illusory-inference apparatus of Bade, Picat, Chung and Mascarenhas's
reply to Mascarenhas and Picat, its two routes to the disjunctive fallacy, and the derivations
the paper runs for the epistemic and deontic possibility modals.

From *(a and b) or else c* and *a*, reasoners conclude *b* about 85% of the time though it does
not follow: the disjunction raises the Hamblin alternatives *a and b* and *c*, the first
alternative carries the hint, and selecting it yields the conclusion by conjunction elimination
(`Erotetic.Problem.Illusory` with the `Matches` rule, the §3.2 hallmark). Mascarenhas and Picat
found the same illusion with *might*, whose attentive content is the alternative set `{φ, ⊤}` of
[ciardelli-groenendijk-roelofsen-2009], so *might (a and b)* is the schema's first premise with
`c` the tautology (`Erotetic.mightProblem_eq_disjunction`, by `rfl`); indefinites instantiate it
with one alternative per witness, under the weaker `Overlaps` rule. The second route is
exhaustification ((4), after [spector-2007]): innocent exclusion against the substitution
alternatives strengthens the disjunction to its exclusive reading
(`Exhaustification.exhIE_conjDisjAlternatives`), from which the conclusion follows classically;
posterior-based accounts, by contrast, cannot separate the conclusions *b* and *c* without a
prior asymmetry (`Erotetic.posterior_eq_iff`). The shared apparatus lives in
`Processing.Reasoning.Erotetic`; this file keeps what is specific to the paper. Footnote 6's
excludability asymmetry is derived (`might_not_excludable`, `allowed_excludable`), as is the
fact that the revised flat premise disarms it for both modals (`revised_flat_not_excludable`).

The experiment's printed contrasts live in `Data.Experiments.BadeEtAl2022`, and §3.2's anatomy
of the illusion is read off the paper's verdict rows: *might* satisfies criteria A–C
(`might_anatomy`) while *allowed to* fails the order and dynamics criteria
(`allowed_not_anatomy`), the paper's ground for classifying the deontic fallacies — about 50%,
and structure-insensitive — as the work of another mechanism, with the package deal of
[merin-1992] and [van-rooy-2000] as the candidate ((16), a datum). The relational route (14)
rests on realism of the modal base: a base is realistic exactly when what is actual is possible
(`Modality.isRealistic_iff_id_le_simplePossibility`), the assumption that is standard for
epistemics and absurd for deontics; with an ordering source, reflexivity alone does not make
best-worlds possibility veridical (`exists_not_possibility`).

## Implementation notes

* Alternatives are Hamblin sets `Set (Set W)`: the repo's InqB supports are lower sets, so the
  attentive `φ ∨ ⊤` collapses to `⊤` there (`support_inqDisj_top`), exactly what the attentive
  proposal avoids.
* The indefinite instance uses the `Overlaps` selection rule: its match is on the witness,
  which bare propositions cannot see, and the paper gives no criterion beyond "related to".
* (4b) is `Exhaustification.exhIE_conjDisjAlternatives`; the four-member Sauerland set
  provably does not yield it.
* Criteria A–C of the anatomy are derived from the paper's own contrast verdicts, with the
  marginal order contrast counting as a difference, as the paper's classification requires; D
  and the full classification are the paper's marks in the `anatomy` rows.
