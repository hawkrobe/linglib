# Groenendijk and Stokhof (1984): Studies on the Semantics of Questions

Groenendijk and Stokhof take a question to be a partition of the indices, here a `Setoid`. *Who
walks* relates two indices when the same individuals walk at both (`who`), so that at an index it
denotes the proposition true exactly where the walkers are those of that index, and *whether p*
is the bipartition by `p`. *Know* and *tell* relate an individual to the proposition denoted, so
to know who walks is to have one's alternatives inside the actual cell (`Knows`). An
individual's information at an index is a set of indices compatible with what they believe
inside a set compatible with what they know, which contains the index (`InformationSets`). A
proposition answers a question for the individual when adding it to their information leaves
the information inside one cell, and answers it partially when it rules out a cell.

## Main statements

* `Knows.mem_core`: to know the answer is to know every true proposition the question decides.
* `not_knows_who_of_believes`: believing that someone walks who does not excludes knowing who
  walks.
* `who_compl`: *who walks* and *who doesn't walk* are one question.
* `who_le_whichDeRe`, `whichDeRe_compl`, `Men.readings_independent`: *which man walks* read de
  re follows from *who walks* and is *which man doesn't walk* read de re, while the de dicto
  reading is independent of it.
* `karttunen_knows_of_knows`, `Walkers.karttunen_knows`: Karttunen's postulate for *know*
  follows from this one, but holds of someone who wrongly believes that Suzy walks.
* `InformationSets.update`, `InformationSets.LetsKnow.givesTrueAnswer`: updating with a
  proposition keeps information well formed, and a proposition that lets one know an answer
  gives a true one.
* `Figure13.letsKnow_byName`: of a name and a description that answer alike on someone's
  beliefs, only the name, which is true, lets them know the answer.
* `better_or_inter_or_union`: of two compatible partial answers, one is better, or their
  conjunction or their disjunction is better than both.
* `knowsSome_of_knows`: knowing who has a pen gives the mention-some knowledge once someone has a
  pen.

## Implementation notes

Extensions are topical properties `E → Set W` and attitudes are `SetRel W W` read through
`SetRel.core`. Mathlib's order on `Setoid` is the dissertation's inclusion of questions
(`Setoid.le_iff_forall_classes`), whose dual atoms are the bipartitions (`Setoid.isCoatom_iff`).
The domain of individuals is fixed across indices, as the dissertation assumes in accepting (X);
the update of information is classical, and giving an answer leaves out chapter IV's
presupposition that the question is open. The mention-some question is `Question.which`. Two
printed claims are corrected, the equation for the answers compatible with a conjunction
(`TwoCells.determined_inter_ne`) and the cells that *(at least) an M G's* rules out in figure 15
(`Figure15.indefinite_partial_false`). Page numbers are the dissertation's printed ones.

## TODO

* Chapter IV's indirect answers and its comparison and correctness of answers (sections 7 to 9),
  the pragmatic comparison of appendix 2 of chapter V, and the claim that a partial answer to a
  bipartition is complete (chapter IV, p. 235).
* Chapter V's linguistic answers and the pragmatic properties of terms, and chapter VI's choice
  readings, whose examples are rows of `Data.Examples.GroenendijkStokhof1984`.
* Chapter III's functional readings.
