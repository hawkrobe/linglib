# Kirkpatrick (2023): The Dynamics of Generics

This file formalizes [kirkpatrick-2023]'s dynamic semantics for generics and its account of
generic Sobel sequences: a generic followed by a statement of its exceptions, (1), is felicitous
and judged true, while the reverse order, (2), is infelicitous and sounds contradictory. Static
theories assign each generic a truth value on its own, so the truth of a sequence is a
conjunction invariant under reordering and the contrast is invisible to them, §3
(`static_perm`). The theory builds on the normality-based semantics (22), on which a generic is
true when every normal instance of its restrictor satisfies its matrix: the normality functor of
(21) is a `Genericity.Normality` and (22) is its generic. The dynamic theory of (24) evaluates a
generic against a modal horizon, the set of salient individuals, which the generic first expands
with the normal instances of its restrictor when none is yet salient (`update`), and the generic
is true when every salient instance of its restrictor satisfies its matrix (`holds`). This is
again a generic, under the normality whose normal instances of a restrictor are those on the
updated horizon (`horizon`), and discourse-initially it is the static generic (22)
(`holds_empty`). In a Sobel sequence the exceptions are abnormal for the general and so absent
from its horizon, while the reverse order puts them on the horizon first, where the general
finds them and no longer expands: the two orders come apart exactly as the paper predicts
(`SobelPair.order_sensitive`). The ravens of (25) and (28) are ranked by how they are coloured,
the albino abnormal (`ravenNormality`), and a mixed sequence like (29) survives because each
generic's restrictor excludes the individuals the other made salient (`lions_both_orders`).
Appendix A's comparison with [veltman-1996] is checked on his eight worlds: the frame presented
by accepted rules is insensitive to their order, so his theory predicts the reverse sequence
consistent (`veltman_reverse_consistent`).

## Implementation notes

* (24) is taken at a single world: the dispositional orbit is a point, so the normality functor
  of (21) is a normality at a single index and the modal horizon a set of individuals. The
  arguments of §5 are pointwise in the accessible world and survive the restriction.
* The contextual variable C of (20) is folded into the restrictor, as (26) and (31) do.
